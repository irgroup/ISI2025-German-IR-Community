<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes our approaches for the TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization track, including push notifications scenario and email digest scenario. In the push notifications scenario, we mainly focus on designing a real-time system, which listens to the Twitter sample stream and makes the push actions for the given topics. Low coupling modules are utilized to obtain the timely, relevant and novel features. In the email digest scenario, we apply the language model combined with the external knowledge base, i.e. Google, for query expansion. Besides, different text similarity algorithms are tried, such as negative KL-divergence and Simhash. Experimental results show that our two-stage filtering methods achieve good performance with respect to EG1 and nCG1 metrics for push notifications scenario. In addition, our systems for email digest scenario also obtain convincing nDCG1 scores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>With the rapid development of the microblog, such as Twitter and Weibo, the information that microblog covered is rather numerous than expected. To explore user's interests and boost recommendation performance in real-time environment, TREC first introduced Tweet Timeline Generation (TTG) track in 2014 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,138.03,488.44,65.83,8.64" target="#b2">(Lin et al. 2014</ref>) and developed it in 2015. The Real-Time Summarization Track in TREC 2016 is a real-time summarization task broken down into two scenarios, which is aiming to explore techniques for monitoring streams of social media posts with respect to users' interest profiles. Different from the last year's Microblog track, it requires a real on-line decision, which means participating systems need to decide whether or not push notification for a tweet before seeing the subsequent tweets. And two scenarios are described as follow:</p><p>• Scenario A (push notification): Content that is identified as relevant and novel by a system based on the user's interest profile should be sent to the user in a timely fashion. • Scenario B (email digest): Participating systems should identify tweets and aggregate them into an email digest. The email should be periodically sent to a user. Under that circumstances, users can read a longer story about the contents.</p><p>*Corresponding author.</p><p>In the push notifications scenario, our system requires to "listen" to the Twitter API<ref type="foot" coords="1,423.64,228.77,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and make real-time push actions for each interest profile. We design an on-line system which contains three modules: Filter Module, Judge Module and Submit Module. When a new tweet D comes, we use Filter Module to remove it if it has no overlap words with all the interest profiles. In the Judge Module, we first estimate the relevance score between the tweet and each interest profile using negative KL-divergence. A tuned relevance threshold α is utilized to judge whether D and the interest profile are relevant. Meanwhile, we keep a push queue for each interest profile. Then, for every relevant interest profile Q, we estimate the novel score by comparing D with previous tweets in its push queue. Similarly, we use negative KL-divergence and a tuned novel threshold β to decide whether D is a novel one for the interest profile Q. Submit Module is used to submit passed tweets to the Evaluation Broker with the power to handle error code from the remote server. It can also store the push queue for each interest profile and help recover our system if any crash happens.</p><p>In the scenario of email digest, similar with scenario A, we firstly clean the raw tweets generated from the evaluation period. To better understand the user intent, we utilize Google web resource as external evidences to expand original query. Then, the language model framework is applied to estimate the relevance between given interest profile with candidate tweets. For each interest profile, we rank the candidate tweets of every day by the relevance scores which adopt two different smooth methods. Once we obtain the ranked tweet list, we calculate the novelty scores between the candidate tweet with each tweet that has been pushed previously, the novelty threshold γ is used to determine whether the candidate tweet is included in the email digest. And there are two kinds of strategies to measure the novelty, i.e. negative KL-divergence and Simhash.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we mainly discuss the preliminaries for interest profiles and tweets in both scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query Expension</head><p>As the length of tweets are limited to 140 characters, the microblog retrieval suffers severely from the vocabulary mismatch problem. Query expansion techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.71,93.46,54.51,8.64;2,54.00,104.42,42.07,8.64" target="#b5">(Zhai and Lafferty 2001</ref>) can be used to improve the retrieval performance. Due to the timely need of the push notifications scenario, we just take advantage of query expansion in the email digest scenario. Details will be discuss in the corresponding section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text Preprocessing</head><p>The preprocessing we adopt on interest profile and tweet stream follows <ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.76,194.32,74.29,8.64">(Qiang and Yang )</ref>  <ref type="table" coords=""></ref>and<ref type="table" coords="2,209.99,194.32,42.08,8.64">(Lv, Yang,</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="2,272.03,194.32,20.47,8.64">Zhao</ref> ), which is described as follows:</p><p>• Non-English Filtering: Tweets written in a language other than English would be judged as not relevant based on guidelines of Real-Time Summarization Track. Thus, we use the twitter's language detector to abandon the non-English tweets. • Non-ASCII Words: Removing all NON-ASCII characters from the tweets will also helps remove non-English tweets.</p><p>• Redundant Retweet Elimination: All additional commentary in the tweets containing "RT @" will be ignored.</p><p>As the guideline mentioned, all retweets should be normalized to the underlying tweets. • Porter Stemming and Stopword Filtering: We remove all stopwords and stem the tweet text using the Natural Language Toolkit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics Inforamtion</head><p>In the language model, if any word in the query is not in the document, the relevant score between them will equal to zero, which is unreasonable. Smooth techniques could solve this problem by merging global word probability distribution with current document model. In our proposed approach, we obtain the global word probability distribution by computing word count information of tweet stream during two time intervals. The first one is 2015 July, which is offered by the TREC 2 . The second one is a week before the track, we obtain it via listening to the official Twitter stream.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario A: Push Notifications</head><p>As previously mentioned, the goal of push notifications is to recommend relevant and novel tweets based on the users interest profile in real-time. At a high level, push notifications should be relevant (on topic), timely (provide updates as soon after the actual event occurrence as possible), and novel (users should not be pushed multiple notifications that say the same thing). In this section, we mainly describe the architecture of our proposed system, which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,54.00,644.43,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>From the figure, we can observe that our system mainly contains three processes and two storage tables:  • Filter Module: In order to accelerate the speed of identifying possible relevant tweets for each profile, We first build a interest vocabulary based on all words in the given users' interest profiles. Then, the Twitter sample stream is obtained via the Twitter API. For each crawled tweet, we check whether it contains any words in our interest vocabulary. If contains, we insert it into our candidate tweets storage table . If not, filter it. In this way, we simply ignore tweets that do not contain any keywords for each profile. • Judge Module: This process keeps "listening" to the candidate tweets storage table. In every T 1, it selects at most K1 untreated candidate tweets and compare them with the given users' interest profiles. For each (tweet, profile) pair, we first calculate the relevant score between them by the text similarity function f . If the relevant score is bigger than α, we then compute similarity scores between this tweet and all pushed tweets of this profile via the text similarity function f , the biggest one will be chosen as the novel score. If the novel score is smaller than β, we will insert it into the submission tweets storage table. In the last, these selected tweets will be set to treated or removed from the storage table. • Submit Module: This process keeps "listening" to the submission tweets storage table. In every T 2, it selects at most K2 untreated submission tweets and try to submit them to the evalation broker one by one. If return code is 204 for one tweet, which means the remote server accepted it successfully, we will set the submitted tweet treated or remove it from the storage table. Otherwise, the tweet is going to handle in the next round until accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarity Algorithm</head><p>We utilize the negative KL-divergence language model for f and g to measure the relevance between query language model θ Q and tweet language model θ D with the help of collection lanuage model θ C . The smoothing methods we use for language model are: (a) Jelinek-Mercer Smoothing</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,63.96,173.08,228.54,88.17">JM (Q,D, C) = w∈Q P (w| θ Q )• log (1 -λ) * P (w| θ D ) + λ * P (w| θ C ) (1) (b) Dirichlet Smoothing DIR(Q, D, C) = JM (Q, D, C), λ = µ |D| + µ (2)</formula><p>Parameter Selection</p><p>The T 1 and T 2 are both set to 10 seconds. K1 is set to 1000 while K2 is set to 10 due to their different scale. Those parameters are set empirically and mainly depend on your computer performance. α and β are tuned via grid search on TREC 2015 dataset, which is showed in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,240.29,331.22,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario B: Email Digest</head><p>In the email digest scenario, we will identify a batch of up to 100 ranked tweets per day per interest profile. At a high level, these results should be relevant and novel. Timeliness is not important as long as the tweets were all posted on the previous day.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,135.00,510.75,3.88,8.64" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, our system for this scenario mainly contains four modules:</p><p>• Data Cleaning Module: We preprocess all tweets during evaluation period. And we simply filter tweets that do not contain any keywords for each interest profile, and the rest tweets are chosen as candidate tweet collection, which will accelerate identifying possible relevant tweets for each profile. • Query Expansion Module: As microblog retrieval suffers severely from the vocabulary mismatch problem (i.e. term overlap between query and tweet is relatively small). To tackle this issue, we leverage web-based query expansion method to improve retrieval performance. As is known to all, Google search is the dominant search engine in the majority countries over the world, which indexes billions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.95,684.56,66.37,8.64" target="#b0">(Arlington 2008)</ref> of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query Expansion Module</head><p>Relevance  keywords and operators. Therefore, we take the interest profile as the keywords to search in Google with Google Search Engine API before the evaluation period. As the user interest profile offered by TREC 2016 are JSONformatted structure and each profile includes four fields, topid, title, description and narrative. Here we only use the topic keywords as our OriginQuery since we utilize external web resource to depict the background information, noted as ExpansionQuery. We utilize the expanded query to represent the interest profile and then estimate the relevance between the query and tweets.</p><p>• Relevance Ranking Module: Similar with the push notifications scenario, we utilize the text similarity function f to measure the relevance between query and tweet. Then, all the tweets are ranked based on their relevance score.</p><p>• Novelty Verfication Module: Once we obtain the ranked tweet list after relevance ranking, we will traverse over them and judge novelty for each tweet, until we collect enough tweets (the count of pushed tweets is up to 100).</p><p>We use the text similarity function g to measure the novelty between tweet and the pushed tweets of interest profile.</p><p>When the novelty score is smaller than γ, we think the tweet is a novel one for current interest profile and should be pushed. In this module, there are two kinds of strategies to measure novelty between tweets: (1) Negative KLdivergence. The higher relevance score between tweets, the less novelty they are.</p><p>(2) Simhash. It is a popular method to handle web page redundancy <ref type="bibr" coords="3,489.13,640.72,64.59,8.64" target="#b1">(Charikar 2002)</ref>. Simhash is one where similiar items are hashed to similiar hash values and we can calculate the bitwise hamming distance between hash values. The closer hamming distance between two tweets is, the more similar they are. The simhash code is calculated as follow,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,119.26,68.33,173.24,19.91">Sim code = sign( i=1∈n w i c i ) (3)</formula><p>where w i is the weight of term i and c i is the hash code of term i, sign is symbol function that make positive to 1 and negative to 0 for every bit in code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter Selection</head><p>γ is tuned via grid search on TREC 2015 dataset, which is showed in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,121.30,164.16,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. For the push notifications scenario, the primary evaluation metrics include Expected Gain (EG) and Normalized Cumulative Gain (nCG). In the EG1 and nCG1 variants of the metrics, on a "silent day", the system receives a score of one (i.e., perfect score) if it does not push any tweets, or zero otherwise. In the EG0 and variants of the metrics, for a silent day, all systems receive a gain of zero no matter what they do. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,164.47,433.06,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the performance of our submitted three runs. We could observe that in every run, EG1 and nCG1 are much larger than EG0 and nCG0, which means our proposed system could recognise the "silent day" and make no push actions to avoid bothering users. We use different text similarity algorithms in different runs but their performance are similar, which could tell the robustness of the negative KL-divergence with different smoothing strategies. The primary evaluation metric is nDCG1. As it turns out, PKUICSTRunB3 significantly outperforms both other runs, indicating that the Simhash method for novelty verification module is successful in identifying novel tweets. Both PKUICSTRunB1 and PKUICSTRunB2 adopt the negative KL-divergence, with JM smoothing and DIR smoothing respectively. For each run, the uniform novel thresholds are training on the TREC 15 dataset. From Table <ref type="table" coords="4,504.00,57.48,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, we can see that nDCG1 and nDCG0 are the same in PKUICSTRunB1 and PKUICSTRunB2, which means on each "silent day", our system still pushed some tweets that are regarded as unrelated ones. Obviously, the thresholds do not fit well. Further investigation and experiments are needed to solve this issue. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present our systems for TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization Track. In the push notification scenario, we pay main attention on designing a online system for handling the real-time Twitter sample stream and make proper push actions for each interest profile. In the email digest scenario, We apply web-based query expansion using language model to rank candidate tweets and then we leverage two kinds of strategies to measure novelty between tweets. Experimental results show our effectiveness and efficiency of our system in both tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,66.65,684.34,2.99,5.18;2,70.14,686.20,213.85,7.77;2,54.00,696.16,8.97,7.77;2,427.42,66.21,41.28,13.55;2,438.50,82.46,18.90,13.56;2,424.61,284.93,59.67,13.55;2,435.50,301.18,37.83,13.56;2,372.67,83.94,37.18,6.78;2,473.63,189.65,39.03,6.78;2,363.63,286.55,42.32,6.78;2,392.45,113.33,37.51,5.50;2,449.71,113.33,10.98,5.50;2,402.21,124.81,17.52,5.51;2,450.25,124.81,9.52,5.51;2,402.55,136.15,17.53,5.51;2,449.89,135.82,10.78,5.51;2,402.03,173.42,18.36,5.50;2,449.89,173.42,10.77,5.50;2,419.61,155.45,5.51,4.34;2,395.78,201.46,30.67,5.51;2,449.60,201.46,11.05,5.51;2,402.10,212.95,17.53,5.51;2,450.14,212.95,9.54,5.51;2,402.43,224.31,17.53,5.50;2,450.32,223.96,9.54,5.51;2,401.32,261.56,19.58,5.51;2,449.77,261.56,10.80,5.51;2,419.50,243.60,5.51,4.37"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>2 https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-twitter-stream-2015-07</figDesc></figure>
