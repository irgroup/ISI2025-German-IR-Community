<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The task of the clinical decision support track in TREC 2016 requires a system to retrieve and return the most relevant biomedical articles after giving the electronic health report as query. Firstly, we consider two important factors i.e., query length and specific term's occurrence, and adopt two models by the combination of a novel TF-IDF method and the traditional BM25. We name them as MATFB and MATFM respectively. Then, a linear combination of the two models which is denoted as NEWBM is considered. The experimental results show that different kinds of queries might prefer one of the three models, and our system performs better than the median performance on most metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The goal of this track is to find relevant articles for the clinician to improve their decision making in the diagnosis, treatment and test of patients. In 2015, 0.73 million reports was published. In 2016, TREC dataset contains 1.25 million reports. Different from the previous cases where a synthetic query is provided, this year the real notes (i.e., hospital records) are given as queries and are extracted by clinicians, which contain a lot of abbreviations and other language styles. A note is usually longer than a summary and a description. Its average length is more than 300 words. All of this will bring new challenges for traditional retrieval systems.</p><p>Most of the existing retrieval models use a single term frequency (TF) normalization mechanism. For example, in the probabilistic models, documents are assumed as independent with each other in the collection, and the distribution of a term does not depend on the other terms in the same document. But frequency of a term in a document is relative to the frequency of the other terms in the same document, which gives important clue that cannot be achieved by the commonly used document length based normalization scheme. Another major limitation of the current models is that most models cannot achieve a good balance when dealing with short and long documents. If the parameter b is set to a smaller value, it will perform better for short queries, and when the parameter value is set larger, longer queries will benefit more than the shorter ones. The situation is suitable for BM25, language models or divergence from randomness based models. A novel TF-IDF term weighting scheme MATF <ref type="bibr" coords="1,282.22,653.73,12.31,9.27" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was ever proposed to retrieve related documents.</p><p>In our system, we consider two important factors i.e., query length and specific term's occurrence, and adopt two models by the combination of a novel TF-IDF method and the traditional BM25 which are named as MATFB and MATFM respectively. Then, a linear combination of the two models is also considered. The evaluation results show that our system performs better than the median performance on most metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2．Our Approach</head><p>In this section, we will introduce the models used in our system in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">MATFM Model</head><p>We first propose an approach named MATFM, which combines TF of MATF with IDF of BM25. In 2013, Jiaul h.Paik proposed MATF model which introduces two aspects of term frequency normalization. One is the relative intra-document TF ( RITF ) involving the average term frequency ( ( ) AvgTF D ) of a document. The other is the length regularized TF ( LRTF ) involving the average length of a documents ( ( )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADL C</head><p>). This method can maintain a good balance between short and long document and makes use of the query length information. In our system, we use asymptotically bounded function (similar to Robertson and Walker <ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.52,232.53,11.87,9.27" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) to transform the TF factors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,165.72,264.02,335.78,54.62">2 2 2 2 2 2 log (1 ( , )) / log (1 ( )) ( , ) (1 ) 1 log (1 ( , )) / log (1 ( )) ( , ) (log (1 ( ) / ( )) 1 ( , ) (log (1 ( ) / ( )) TF t D AvgTF D TFF t D TF t D AvgTF D TF t D ADL C len D TF t D ADL C len D                  (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,501.50,286.02,3.89,9.49">)</formula><p>where  is the query length factor. Its value will be reduced with the increase of the query length, We confine the query length factor by the requirements.

The formula of the traditional BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.64,534.81,12.31,9.27" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,152.04,567.01,349.49,36.74">1 3 3 1 ( 1) 0.5 ( 1) log( ) ( ) 0.5 (1 ( ) ( ) td t t q t q t t td k tf N df k qtf rsv len D df k qtf k b b tf ADL C                   (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="2,501.53,574.50,3.92,9.49">)</formula><p>where N is the number of indexed documents in the collection, t qtf is the within-query term frequency, b and 1 k are two tuning parameters. BM25 does not apply document length information well, so we use TFF in Equation 1 with the IDF of BM25 cross multiply, which makes up a new model named MATFM.</p><p>( , ) log( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="2,235.56,675.42,262.64,24.33">t q t N MATFM TFF t D df    <label>(3)</label></formula><p>Considering that three kinds of queries are provided in this task where the average length of a summary, a description and a note is 34.2, 123.4, and 309.8 respectively, so MATFM model choose to use the query length to adjust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">MATFB Model</head><p>In a given document, term frequency TF is usually normalized and inverse document frequency (IDF) is regarded as a measure to prevent a system to prefer longer document. The standard IDF method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.05,123.33,12.31,9.27" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="3,257.16,138.77,245.86,23.08">1 ( , ) log( ) ( , ) N IDF t C DF t C   (4)</formula><p>It considers only the presence or absence of a term in a document and does not take into account the specific term occurrence for a document.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">NEWBM Model</head><p>Due to lots of medical special terms appeared in documents, three kinds of queries represent different lengths. We further combine the two factors together (i.e., query length and specific term occurrence) by a linear way as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12" coords="3,201.72,469.12,200.91,26.53">1 1 ( 1) ( , ) log( ) (1 ) * ( , )<label>(1 (</label></formula><p>))</p><formula xml:id="formula_13" coords="3,119.04,468.79,385.68,33.70">td d t q r q t td avg N k tf NEWBM p TFF t D P TDF t C L df k b b tf L                  (7)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental Results</head><p>Our system was developed on the Lucene platform. This year's theme is from three different types i.e., diagnosis, test, and treatment, and the example is introduced as follows:</p><p>We eventually submitted five runs for the clinical decision support track in 2016.
