<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>is paper describes the participation of Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) at TREC 2016 Contextual Suggestion 1 track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,262.18,451.30,10.42,7.95" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. is year's Contextual Suggestion track consisted of two phases, namely, Phase 1 and Phase 2. We participated in both of them. For Phase 1, the participants were given a list of 442 users who had visited from 30 to 60 venues in 1 or 2 cities. For each user, context and pro le were de ned. e task consisted in producing for each user a ranked list of 50 venues to visit in a new city. e suggested venues were limited to be from the collection of venues that was provided by the organizers. As for Phase 2, the contexts and pro les were the same. However, for each user there was also a list of candidate suggestions. e task consisted in reranking the list of candidate suggestions to produce the best ranking according to each user's pro le and context.</p><p>For both phases we followed a similar approach to our participation at TREC 2015 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.27,604.73,9.41,7.95" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.92,604.73,7.41,7.95" target="#b1">2]</ref> to create an initial user model. However, this year we focused more on the user context and explored how we could predict the level of appropriateness given a venue and a user's context. We modeled it as a classi cation problem and picked 10% of the data randomly as our training set. More speci cally, we built two datasets: one containing the labels for training data and the other one containing the features. e reported results of TREC shows that the base user model was able to capture user interest 1 h ps://sites.google.com/site/treccontext/ and opinion e ectively and the contextual appropriateness model enabled the model to suggest venues that were more appropriate to the users context. e remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details our approach to gather information and model the users.</p><p>en, Section 3 describes how we predict the contextual appropriateness of venues. Section 4 presents our experimental evaluation. Finally, Section 5 concludes the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CONTEXTUAL SUGGESTION</head><p>In this task we modeled users by leveraging data mainly from Yelp. We further enriched these models using data from Foursquare and the contextual appropriateness prediction model. We used classi ers to model users' behavior and we enriched user models by combining other measures. At a high level, our system consists of ve modules:</p><p>• Information gathering • User modeling • User model enrichment • Contextual appropriateness prediction • Suggestion ranking e system's execution cycle starts with the module for data collection. is module collects information from the most important data sources, such as Yelp and Foursquare. Using the gathered information, user modeling creates a basic model for each user. en, model enrichment improves the user models by adding two additional measures based on user-category pro les and Foursquare's venue-taste keywords. e contextual appropriateness prediction model predicts how appropriate each venue is to each context, providing an additional score in our model. Subsequently, suggestion ranking module ranks all candidate places. In the following sections we provide more details for each component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Information Gathering</head><p>Since we participated in both phases, we were provided with users' history and a large number (virtually 600K) of venues to be ranked for Phase 1. However, since a list of candidate suggestion was included in the dataset for Phase 2, the number of links presenting venues that we had to crawl was reduced to virtually 19K. Moreover, the task of suggesting places to each user in Phase 2 was limited to a certain number of venues, hence it was crucial not to miss any information relevant to the target venues. Additionally, although almost half of the URLs was from known location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Yelp and Foursquare, another half of the URLs was from less known websites (e.g., the places' o cial web pages). Consequently, e ort was made to nd the corresponding pro les of these places on Yelp and Foursquare, too.</p><p>To collect data we performed the following steps:</p><p>(1) We discarded the a ractions that were rated by the users with a score of '-1' or '2'. is is due to the fact that these places either were not assigned any ratings or their rating was neutral, thus insigni cant. (2) We detected and discarded broken links.</p><p>(3) We downloaded the links from the target LBSNs, namely, Yelp and Foursquare. (4) For each venue on each of the above-mentioned LBSNs we found the corresponding pro les on the other LBSN (e.g., for a given Yelp pro le, we found its corresponding pro le on Foursquare). ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,73.09,221.05,3.17,7.95">5</ref>) For the other a ractions with unknown links, we downloaded the web pages, and analyzed their contents to nd their corresponding pro les on the two above-mentioned LBSNs.</p><p>For Phase 1, due to the large number of venues to be crawled, we only crawled Foursquare using their API. For Phase 2, we managed to crawl both Yelp and Foursquare for all the venues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">User Modeling</head><p>We modeled each user by training a classi er using example suggestions. Our intuition was that a user's opinion regarding a venue could be learned based on the opinions of other users who gave the same rating as the target user to the same venue <ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.14,358.16,9.29,7.95" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. To train a classi er per user we extracted negative and positive samples as explained in the following:</p><p>• Positive samples: We elicited the positive reviews of positive-example suggestions. • Negative samples: Likewise, we elicited the negative reviews of negative-example suggestions.</p><p>We de ned the positive example suggestions as the venues that a user rated as 3 or 4, so the positive reviews were those reviews that were rated accordingly. Analogously, negative example suggestions and reviews were de ned as taking ratings of 0 and 1. We adopted a binary classi er per user to learn why she might have liked/disliked some venues and to assign a score for a new venue <ref type="foot" coords="2,76.04,503.97,3.38,6.45" target="#foot_0">2</ref> . e binary classi er was trained using the positive and negative pro les for each user. Since the users' reviews may contain a lot of noise and o -topic terms, we calculated a TF-IDF score and used it as the feature vector for training the classi er. As classi er we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,208.63,549.96,10.69,7.95" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and considered the value of the SVM's decision function as the score (S r e ) since it gives us an idea on how close and relevant a venue is to a user pro le.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">User Model Enrichment</head><p>We used some frequency-based scores to enrich the user model. Frequency-based scores are based on the assumption that a user visits the venues that she likes more frequently than other venues and rates them positively. We created positive and negative pro les based on categories of venues that a user had visited and calculated their corresponding normalized frequencies. A new venue was then compared with the user's pro les to compute a similarity score. We explain the score for venue categories. e same method was applied for other frequency-based scores.</p><p>Given a user u and her history of rated venues h u = { 1 , . . . , n }, each venue has a corresponding list of categories C ( i ) = {c 1 , . . . , c k }. We de ne the user category pro les as follows:</p><p>De nition 2.1. A Positive-Category Pro le is a set of all distinct categories belonging to venues that a particular user has previously rated positively. A Negative-Category Pro le is de ned analogously for the venues that are rated negatively.</p><p>We assigned a user-level-normalized frequency value to each category in the positive/negative category pro le. e user-levelnormalized frequency for a positive/negative category pro le is de ned as follows:</p><p>De nition 2.2. A User-level-Normalized Frequency for an item (e.g., category) in a pro le (e.g., positive-category pro le) is de ned as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,379.15,286.24,111.88,23.52">cf + u (c i ) = count (c i ) k ∈h u c j ∈C ( k ) 1</formula><p>.</p><p>A user-level-normalized frequency for negative category pro le, c f -, is calculated analogously.</p><p>Based on De nitions 2.1 and 2.2 we created positive/negative category pro les for each user. Let u be a user and be a candidate venue, then the category-based similarity score S cat (u, ) is calculated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,368.27,385.48,189.93,22.75">S cat (u, ) = c i ∈C ( ) cf + u (c i ) -cf - u (c i ) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>e frequency-based category similarity score was calculated using the data from both Yelp (denoted as S Y cat ) and Foursquare (denoted as S F cat ). e venue taste keywords on Foursquare are special terms extracted from users' tips <ref type="foot" coords="2,405.41,456.68,3.38,6.45" target="#foot_1">3</ref> and are very informative. For example, 'Central Park' in 'New York City' is described by these taste keywords: picnics, biking, scenic views, trails, park, . . . ese terms are very informative and o en express characteristics of an a raction as well as the users sentiment. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,463.95,502.67,4.25,7.95" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a snapshot from Foursquare with the venue taste keywords and categories for Central Park in New York. We created the positive and negative pro les using venue taste keywords for each user following De nition 2.1 and calculated the user-level-normalized frequencies in the proles following De nition 2.2. e frequency-based similarity score for venue taste keywords was then calculated in a similar way to Equation 1(S F ke ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CONTEXTUAL APPROPRIATENESS PREDICTION</head><p>As described in the guidelines of the track, in addition to the users' history of preferences, the users' context is also available. e context consists of 4 dimensions:</p><p>• Trip type: business, holiday, other • Trip duration: night out, day trip, weekend trip, longer • Group type: alone, friends, family, other • Trip season: winter, summer, autumn, spring Given a venue and a user's context ux, our aim was to predict how appropriate is for ux: F ap ( , ux ). We assume that each venue is represented by its corresponding categories. erefore, our problem is to predict the appropriateness of a given list of venue categories (c = c 1 , . . . , c n ) for ux. We broke the problem into a set of simpler sub problems, i.e., for each c i ∈ c we predicted the appropriateness score of c i to ux assuming that categories are independent: F ap,c (c i , ux ).</p><p>Furthermore, we calculated the appropriateness score as follows: F ap ( , ux ) = min{F ap,c (c 1 , ux ), . . . , F ap,c (c n , ux )}. For instance, assume that a user is going to visit a venue whose categories (c) are: burger joint and bar. e user context (ux) is: business (trip type), day trip (trip duration), alone (group type), and autumn (trip season). We calculate F ap,c ('burgerjoint , ux ) and F ap,c ('bar , ux ). F ap ( , ux ) would be the minimum value of the two functions.</p><p>We trained a SVM classi er to calculate F ap,c . As training samples, we picked 10% of samples in the dataset and asked human assessors to judge them. For each instance, we assigned three assessors. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,108.44,624.57,4.09,7.95" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the sample questions we asked the workers. We considered a venue category appropriate to a context if more than 2 users agreed on that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Features</head><p>As features for classi cation, we considered the appropriateness of each venue category to each contextual dimension. erefore, for all pairs of category-context, we needed to de ne the appropriateness of the pairs. is is not a trivial task since it could be very subjective. For instance, for a 'family' (group type), it is supposedly not appropriate to visit a 'nightlife spot' (objective). While on a 'business trip' (trip type), visiting a 'pharmacy' depends mostly on the user and other subjective factors. In order to determine how subjective is a pair, we asked human workers to assess the appropriateness of each pair. For each pair we made sure that at least 5 di erent workers assessed it.</p><p>e level of agreement between workers was considered as the level of subjectivity of each pair. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,343.70,515.21,4.21,7.95" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows some example questions we asked the workers. It is worth noting that we included almost all category-context pairs for this job irrespective of their availability in the TREC collection.</p><p>is makes this dataset more general. We trained a SVM classi er using these features and called the value of the decision function of the classi er F ap,c . e value of F ap ( , ux ) was considered as another similarity score in our model, referred to as S F cx t .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>We estimated the similarity between user and candidate suggestion using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,351.32,653.36,206.88,30.29">Similarity(u, ) = ω 1 S Y r e (u, ) + ω 2 S Y cat (u, )+ ω 3 S F cat (u, ) + ω 4 S F ke (u, ) + ω 5 S F cx t (u, ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where ω 1...5 are the weights assigned to these scores, u is a given user and is a given venue. To nd the optimum se ing for the  weights associated with each score, we conducted a 5-fold cross validation. Note that di erent submi ed runs consisted of di erent sets of scores; subsequently, the weights and Equation 2 would be di erent for each run. We ranked the candidate suggestions according to the similarity measure computed by this module. e higher the similarity score, the higher the rank.</p><p>By applying the method to our gathered dataset, we submi ed two runs for Phase 1: 'USI1' and 'USI2' and three runs for Phase 2: 'USI3', 'USI4', and 'USI5'. We used di erent combinations of scores for each run as described below:</p><p>• USI1: We only used S F cat to rank the candidate suggestions. • USI2: We reranked the top 10 venues of USI1, using S F ke . • USI3: We used Factorization Machines (FM) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,241.93,666.81,10.42,7.95" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to combine all the crawled data. • USI4: We used all the scores except for the contextual appropriateness score, namely, S Y r e , S Y cat , S F cat , and S F ke .</p><p>• USI5: We used all the scores, namely, S Y r e , S Y cat , S F cat , S F ke , and S F cx t .</p><p>In this year's task, we were given 442 pro le-context pairs. For each pair a user's history consisted of 30 to 60 venues and the number of candidate suggestions to be ranked varied for each user (Phase 2). Track organizers evaluated all submi ed runs using three evaluation metrics, namely, nDCG@5 (normalized discounted cumulative gain at 5), P@5 (precision at 5), and MRR (mean reciprocal rank). A suggestion is considered relevant if it is rated 3 or 4 by user.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,350.39,633.30,4.25,7.95" target="#tab_0">1</ref> demonstrates the overall average performances of our runs. It could be seen that for Phase 1 both our runs outperformed the median of all submi ed runs. is con rms the e ectiveness of the user model enrichment method we proposed in this work. However, our run 'USI2' performed be er than the other, suggesting that venue taste keywords (S F ke ) was e ective for modeling users. As for Phase 2, 'USI3' did not perform very well compared to TREC </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this technical report we presented the methodology we applied for our participation in the TREC 2016 Contextual Suggestion track.</p><p>In this track, we showed that our method for suggesting venues to users based on their pro les and context is very e ective. Results suggest that our approach combining multimodal information from multiple LBSNs is able to model users e ectively as in our previous works <ref type="bibr" coords="5,78.69,371.23,7.28,7.95" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,85.97,371.23,3.64,7.95" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,85.97,371.23,3.64,7.95" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.61,371.23,7.28,7.95" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this work, moreover, the results indicate that the contextual appropriateness score is able to e ectively predict the appropriateness of a given venue with respect to a user context. As future work, we plan to explore other ways to incorporate the contextual appropriateness score into our base model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,61.70,377.41,488.61,7.94;3,154.68,82.69,302.65,280.97"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A sample snapshot of Foursquare.com illustrating the di erence of venue categories and venue taste keywords.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,154.68,82.69,302.65,280.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
