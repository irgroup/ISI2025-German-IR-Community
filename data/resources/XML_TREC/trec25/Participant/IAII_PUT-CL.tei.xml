<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Source and target documents and rules</head><p>Unlike previous years, actual electronic health record (EHR) patient records taken from admission notes in MIMIC-III were used instead of synthetic cases. The target document collection for the track was the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central (PMC). PMC is an online digital database of freely available full-text biomedical literature. Because documents are constantly being added to PMC, to ensure the con- Detailed rules for the contest were in guidelines send to participants and in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,447.92,201.42,22.68,8.96;2,124.82,218.58,50.42,8.96">[CDS topics, 2016]</ref>. One such a rule is the following:</p><p>"System data structures (such as dictionaries, indices, thesauri, etc. whether constructed by hand or automatically) can be built using existing documents, topics, and relevance judgments, but these structures may not be modified in response to the new test topics. For example, one can't add topic words that are not in one's dictionary, nor may the system data structures be based in any way on the results of retrieving documents for the test topics and having a human look at the retrieved documents".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Experience</head><p>For the four member team at Information Systems and Technologies Division, IAiII, Poznan University of Technology this was the first participation at any TREC track.</p><p>In our research we use the word embedding <ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.51,415.21,95.96,9.05">[Mikolov et al., 2013a]</ref> with semantic (relation) knowledge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,219.17,432.59,91.43,8.96">[Faruqui et.al., 2015]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.67,432.59,86.25,8.96">[Jauhar et.al., 2015]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,418.90,432.59,51.66,8.96;2,124.82,449.75,65.53,8.96" target="#b2">[Dutkiewicz, Jedrzejek, 2016]</ref>. We are collaborating with Poznan Medical University on mining data related stomach and melanoma cancers. We completed the work on the answer to multiple choice questions that beats the currently best literature result on ones set of test questions by 8% <ref type="bibr" coords="2,279.56,501.59,110.10,8.96" target="#b3">[Frąckowiak et al., 2016]</ref>. For another two benchmark test questions we are very close to leading literature results <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.03,518.75,41.56,8.96;2,124.82,536.59,54.28,8.18" target="#b0">[ACLWEB TOEFL, 2016)</ref>], <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.17,536.03,88.25,8.96" target="#b1">[ACLWEB ESL, 2016)</ref>]. We hoped that this experience would be transferable for Clinical Decision Support track tasks. For the lack of time and resources we were restricted to limited number of options. We did not preprocess the target Open Access Subset of PubMed Central (PMC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Baseline system</head><p>Usually, in TREC research available indexing packages are used, the most popular being Terrier or Lucene systems. In the recent work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.25,166.86,47.99,8.96" target="#b8">[Lin, 2016]</ref> several leading systems were evaluated within the Open-Source IR Reproducibility Challenge for the Gov2 test collection. Among the options was Terrier 4,0 with DPH ranking function, which is a hypergeometric parameter-free model from the Divergence from Randomness family of functions. The query expansion version -the "DPH + Bo1 QE" uses the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which is known to find potentially relevant terms by first querying the index and looking for new terms in high-ranking documents. Specifically, from which 10 terms are added from 3 pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) documents. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.82,322.07,68.95,9.05" target="#b8">[Lin et al., 2016]</ref> found that the "DPH + Bo1 QE" run of Terrier 4.0 was statistically significantly better than all other runs including Terrier's BM25 run, with all other differences were not significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Query expansion</head><p>Expanding queries by adding potentially relevant terms is a common practice in improving relevance in IR systems. The idea is to add synonyms, and other similar terms to query terms. This type of expansion can be divided into two categories. The first category involves the use of ontologies, or lexicons (relational knowledge). In biomedical area UMLS, MeSH, SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, WordNet, and Wikipedia are used. Generally, the result of lexicon type of expansion is positive. The second category is word embedding. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,336.88,515.27,133.93,8.96" target="#b4">[Goodwin and Harabagiu, 2014]</ref> used the Skip-gram word2vec method for query expansion with negative effect compared to baseline.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr" coords="3,130.25,567.14,91.39,8.96" target="#b15">Wang and Fang, 2014]</ref> reported their best result on a method that utilizes both PRF and UMLS-based expansion, and it appears that UMLS contributed more to the performance.</p><p>One can draw experience on effect of using lexicons from other semantic task areas.</p><p>For natural language queries requiring an answer using multiple choice, relational learning using dictionaries encompassing the whole corpus gives always better results than pure word embedding (word2vec). However, having synonym dictionaries (flat structure) can significantly improve the word2vec results. However, situation is more complex with ontologies. A sophisticated analysis of Mesh-based expansion was given by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,163.89,184.14,65.82,8.96" target="#b9">[Lu et al., 2009]</ref>. One can either include Mesh terms (no automatic MeSH explosion) or include MeSH term and the more specific terms beneath it in the MeSH hierarchy, spanning several ontology levels. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,309.31,218.58,68.30,8.96" target="#b9">[Lu et al., 2009]</ref> concluded that MeSH automatic explosion feature improves results for some types of MeSH usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Retrieval methodology setup</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Terrier</head><p>We are using the Terrier v4.1 [Terrier IR Platform] system to index provided set of documents and to retrieve results for a given set of queries. Terrier system provides vast amount of retrieval use cases including, but not limited to indexing a set of document and retrieving information from the set of documents. The Terrier system requires a set of uniformed XML documents to index. Format provided by PUB-MED is an extended format, which includes a lot of metadata, which is not required in neither retrieval nor indexing process. We are using a simple XSLT transformation to  version, which is used for indexing and eventually retrieval.</p><p>We are using a basic bash script to create and index provided with the Terrier software. We set up the indexing within the properties file. At this time we also set up TREC query tags for the expansions. We are using 3 document tags -DOC, DOCID and DOCHDR and a total of 12 distinct query tags -3 basic tags (description, summary and note) and 9 additional tags for different types of expansions (relational knowledge expansion, fixed expansion and linguistic expansions). We use Terrier for the retrieval process. We use a set of configurations, various options for retrieval are described in further sections of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Query expansion details</head><p>We are using three specific expansion methods. The first method expands the query with a fixed vocabulary, which varies depending on the type of the query. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,458.05,662.44,4.25,9.05" target="#tab_0">3</ref>.1 provides the vocabulary sets for each of the types. We call this method the Fixed Expansion. The second type of expansions involves relational knowledge provided by the MeSH ontology. For this type, we run the script, which matches the terms within the text with classes with identical descriptions as the text from the query within the ontology.</p><p>We expand the query with the vocabulary, which is a parallel description of the same class as well as with the descriptions of taxonomical children of that class down 3 levels. We call this method the RK Expansion.</p><p>Third type of expansions involves vector space models, such as word2vec language model <ref type="bibr" coords="6,153.98,496.81,97.43,9.05">[Mikolov et al., 2013a]</ref> ). For this type of expansion we look for the three closest (in a cosine sense of distance) terms to the terms recognized and provided by the MeSH ontology. We expand the query with corresponding results. We have provided runs with various combinations of those three types. We call this method Linguistic Expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In this section we will go through the outcome of every retrieval setup implemented by our group and applied to the competition data sets. We will compare our results to median and best of the CDS submissions. Finally, we will discuss the best application for each setup. For the evaluation we will use NDCG and infAP measures.</p><p>Importance and derivation of those inferred measures is described in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,411.28,308.15,59.17,9.05;7,124.82,325.31,21.56,9.05" target="#b14">[Yilmaz et al., 2008]</ref>. All of the presented evaluation results have been provided by TREC organizers. We have submitted 5 runs. Summary for the runs we provided is presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,160.43,359.97,4.14,8.96" target="#tab_1">4</ref>.1 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description task</head><p>In the following we present PUT results for the Description task.  Additionally, this setup expands query with Fixed Extensions. We refer to the method as having id DDPHBo1CM. This basic method gives decent results. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,455.74,218.58,3.77,8.96" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.1.</p><p>provides infNDCG measure across the topics with respect to this method, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,455.74,235.89,3.77,8.96" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.2.</p><p>presents the same data for the infAP measure. We can observe that, for topics 8, 10, 17 and 28 this method was one of the best performing methods in the entire competition. The reason why there is so much difference between retrieval for specific topics is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,258.63,304.89,3.78,8.96" target="#tab_1">4</ref>.2. It provides extensive information about the texts this setup performs well together with a couple of cases for which the system performed badly. We can observe that topics, on which the setup performed well were descriptive in a common language sense. On the other hand the descriptions loaded with vast amount of professional, biomedical abbreviations cause this setup to perform poorly. Last menstrual period is not known but was sometime three months ago. Five days ago, the patient began feeling achy and congested. She had received a flu shot about 1 week prior. She continued to feel poorly and developed hyperemesis.</p><p>She was seen in the ED (but not admitted), where she was given IVF, Reglan and Tylenol and she was found to have a positive pregnancy test. Today, she returned to the ED with worsening of symptoms. She was admitted to the OB service and given IVF and Reglan. Of note, her labwork demonstrates a blood glucose of 160, bicarbonate of 11, beta-hCG of 3373 and ketones in her urine. Her family noted that she was breathing rapidly and was quite somnolent. She appears to be in respiratory distress.</p><p>Our second run for this task is similar to the first one, however we have provided additional information in a form of RK Expansions and Linguistic Expansions. Let us refer to this method as to an extended method. We observe that multiple extensions frequently lower the quality of result. However, in multiple topics, extended queries gave better results, to achieve an overall lower quality of the answer. Nonetheless there are certain topics, for which the extended method was the best performing one.</p><p>We present the comparison between the extended approach and the overall results in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,153.70,270.23,3.78,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.3. The differences between the basic and extended setup for description task are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,222.05,287.39,3.77,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.4. We can see that the extended version performs similarly to the non-extended one. Overall the results are worse, however there are few topics, where the extended approach gives better results. Among others, topic 8, which is reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,252.65,339.11,4.18,9.05" target="#tab_1">4</ref>.2 gives better results with the extended setup. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Summary task</head><p>The summary task in the competition was in the form of short texts in natural language as input to queries. These pieces of text, as well as the task itself are referred to as Summaries. For this task we have provided a run without any additional expansions. We use a DPH Bo1 method with Pseudo Relevance Feedback referred to as ID SDPHBo1NE. The inferred NDCG and inferred AP summaries are presented in  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Notes task</head><p>The Notes task of this year competition was to match the queries, which are similar to long, very descriptive texts. We have provided two runs for this task. The first one consists of a DPH Bo1 method with Pseudo Relevance Feedback and queries extended with Fixed Expansions. We refer to this method with NDPHBo1C identifier.</p><p>Evaluation of inferred measures is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,353.64,235.67,3.76,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.7. and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,420.24,235.67,3.86,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.8. We can see, that this setup provides good consistent results, however it fails to achieve the best results across. For the second run we have used the same setup with addition of the RK expansions. We refer to this method with identifier NDPHBo1CM identifier.</p><p>Results for the second run are presented on Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,334.90,304.67,3.76,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.9. and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,400.07,304.67,4.10,9.05" target="#fig_9">4</ref>.10. We can see that the expanded setup performs much better than the basic one. Evaluation measures are generally higher than the basic ones, however this setup achieves inferred measures close to the best performing methods.  present data achieved for our system; red series present median data across the competition; green series present the best performance for a given topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and future work</head><p>In all measures our results are approximately 0,02 above the median, which is mostly due to the Terrier DPH Bo1 method chosen as a baseline. We also used Mesh query expansion, word2vec query expansion, and the combination of these two options. The Mesh query expansion improves the results roughly by 0,008, and the word2vec causes the results worse with regard to the baseline.</p><p>It is to be stressed that in <ref type="bibr" coords="16,237.89,606.40,97.42,9.05">[Mikolov et al., 2013a]</ref> the pure word2vec method was presented as better than it actually by choosing an easy type of a corpus such as countries and capitals.
