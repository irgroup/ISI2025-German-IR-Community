<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Answer selection and confidence estimation are two central issues in question answering (QA). The goal of answer selection is to choose from a pool of answer candidates the most likely answer for a question. The problem of confidence estimation is to compute P(correct|Q, A), the probability of answer correctness given a question Q and an answer A. Showing an incorrect answer has negative impact because it not only burdens and but also may mislead the user with incorrect information. Confidence estimation is important because a QA system relies on it to decide whether or not to show the user an answer.</p><p>For answer selection, we used a HMM-based IR system <ref type="bibr" coords="1,360.28,462.65,91.23,10.80" target="#b2">(Miller et al, 1999)</ref> to first select documents that are likely to contain answers to a question and then rank candidate answers based on the answer contexts using the same IR system. Then we used a few constraints to re-rank the candidates. Such constraints include whether a numerical answer quantifies the correct noun, whether the answer is of the correct location sub-type and whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question.</p><p>For confidence estimation, direct estimation of P(correct|Q,A) is impossible because it would require virtually unlimited training data. Instead, we computed the probability based on a few features that concern Q and A. The features were empirically selected with two criteria in mind: being able to predict answer correctness and having a small dimensionality. The features include the type of the question, the number of matched question words in the answer context and whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question.</p><p>We also experimented with using the World Wide Web to supplement the TREC corpus for QA. Our results confirmed the positive findings reported in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" coords="1,464.55,683.43,52.89,10.80;1,90.30,697.23,40.44,10.80" target="#b3">(Dumais et al, 2002)</ref>. We also found that the frequency of an answer in the returned Web pages is a strong predictor of answer correctness.</p><p>We submitted three runs: BBN2002A, BBN2002B and BBN2002C. BBN2002A is our base run, which did not use the Web for answer finding and confidence estimation. Both BBN2002B and BBN2002C used the Web, but they used slightly different methods for confidence estimation. In our experiments, we used the TREC9&amp;10 questions for estimating the parameters that were used in confidence estimation. To be consistent with the TREC 2002 QA track, only factoid questions in TREC9&amp;10 were used for parameter training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Base Run: BBN2002A 2.1 Answer Selection</head><p>Selecting the best answer for a question from the TREC corpus takes the following steps. First we used BBN's IR system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.79,262.63,91.23,10.80" target="#b2">(Miller et al, 1999)</ref> to select the top n documents from the TREC corpus. For the training questions, we set n=100, for efficiency considerations. For the test questions (i.e. TREC 2002 questions), we set n=300.</p><p>The question was then typed. A question classifier automatically assigned the question to one of the 30 types defined in our answer type taxonomy. (In some rare cases a question was assigned to more than one type. For convenience of discussion, we will assume one type per question). Similar to taxonomies used in other QA systems, ours includes common named entities such as persons, dates, locations, numbers, monetary amounts and so forth.</p><p>Then the candidate answers were ranked. The pool of candidates consists of occurrences of named entities in the top documents that match the answer type of the question. Named entities in the documents were recognized using BBN's IdentiFinder system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.20,455.81,84.95,10.80" target="#b4">(Bikel et al, 1999)</ref>. The candidates were first ranked using BBN's IR system. To score a candidate, every text window that has the candidate at the center and has fewer than 60 words (for efficiency considerations) was scored against the question by the IR engine. The score for the candidate took that of the highest-scored window. The purpose of using multiple passages is to avoid choosing the optimal passage length, which is known to a tricky problem. A similar strategy was used by Kaszkiel for document retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,471.47,524.80,45.93,10.80;2,90.26,538.60,71.87,10.80" target="#b0">(Kaszkiel &amp; Zobel, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Then the candidates were re-ranked, by applying the following constraints:</p><p>1. If the question asks for a number, check whether the answer quantifies the same noun in the answer context as in the question. 2. If the question looks for a sub-type of locations (e.g. a country, state or city),</p><p>check whether the answer is of that sub-type. We employed lists of countries, states and cities for this purpose. This constraint is useful because our taxonomy does not distinguish different kinds of locations. 3. Check if the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question. For example, if the question is "Who killed X", a preferred candidate should be the subject of the verb "killed" and X should be the object of "killed" in the answer context. Verb arguments were extracted from parse trees of the question and the sentences in the corpus. We used BBN's SIFT parser <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.02,731.79,91.23,10.80" target="#b1">(Miller et al, 2000)</ref> for verb argument extraction.</p><p>Candidates that satisfy the above constraints were ranked before those that do not. The highest ranked candidate was chosen as the answer for the question. The constraints produced a 2% absolute improvement on the training questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Confidence Estimation</head><p>We used three features to estimate P(correct|Q,A). One feature is whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question. This is a Boolean feature and we denote it VS. Using the training questions, we obtained P(correct|VS is true)=0.49 and P(correct|VS is false)=0.23, which clearly indicate VS is predictive of answer correctness.</p><p>The second feature is a pair of integers (m, n), where m is the number of content words in common between the question and the context of the answer, and n is the total number of content words in the question. The answer context is a text window that is 30 word wide and has the answer at the center. The third feature is T, the answer type of the question. Since the parameters were pre-computed from the training questions, the computing of P(correct|Q,A) for new Q-A pairs requires only a few table lookups.</p><p>3. Using the Web for QA: BBN2002B and BBN2002C Some studies reported positive results using the World Wide Web to supplement the TREC corpora for question answering <ref type="bibr" coords="4,275.94,193.63,96.36,10.80" target="#b3">(Dumais et al, 2002)</ref>. The idea is simple: the enormous amount of data on the Web makes it possible to use very strict, precision oriented search criteria that would be impractical to apply on the much smaller TREC corpora.</p><p>Our technique to exploit the Web for QA is similar to Dumais et al's. We used the Web search engine Google because of its efficiency and coverage. Similar to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,435.08,276.43,67.56,10.80;4,90.11,290.22,25.80,10.80" target="#b3">(Dumais et al, 2002)</ref>, we used two forms of queries, exact and non-exact. The former rewrites a question into a declarative sentence while the latter is a conjunction of all content words in the question. For efficiency considerations, we only looked for answers within the top 100 hits for each Web search. Furthermore, we confined to the short summaries returned by Google rather than using the whole Web pages in order to further cut the processing cost. The summaries were processed using BBN's IdentiFinder. The most frequent named entity that matches the answer type of the question was extracted as the answer. The QA guideline requires the ID of a document in the TREC corpus that supports the answer.</p><p>The highest ranked document that contains the answer string was used for that purpose.</p><p>Both BBN2002B and BBN2002C used the Web for QA, but they used different methods for confidence estimation. For BBN2002B, the confidence of an answer found from the Web is a function of the type of the question and the frequency of the answer in the Google summaries. Specifically, P(correct|Q, A) ≈ P(correct|T, F) ≈ P(correct|T) × 0.5 + P(correct|F) × 0.5 where T = question type F = frequency of A in the Google summaries For BBN2002C, the confidence of an answer A is a function of its frequency F in the Google summaries and a Boolean variable INTREC, which is true if and only if A was also returned by the base run (BBN2002A) from the TREC corpus. Specifically,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P(correct|Q, A)≈P(correct|F, INTREC)</head><p>The Boolean variable INTREC is a useful feature because a lot of data on the Web is of dubious quality and as such some kind of validation of the Web answers is necessary. The question-answer pairs from the Web were merged with the ones produced by the base run (i.e. BBN2002A). Since for the TREC2002 QA track each question can only have one answer, we chose the one with the higher confidence score if the Web answer and the answer from base run are different for a question. If the Web answer and the answer from the base run agree, the confidence score took the maximum of the two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TREC2002 Results</head><p>We measured our TREC 2002 QA results using two scores. The first is the un-weighted score, which is the percentage of questions for which the answer is correct. The second is the confidence-weighted score, as described by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.57,463.73,73.44,10.80" target="#b5">Voorhees, 2003</ref>. Although the confidence-weighted score does not directly reflect the goodness of the confidence estimation, they correlate strongly because the score rewards systems that place correct question-answer pairs ahead of incorrect ones. It is easy to verify that the un-weighted score is a baseline for the confidence-weighted score where the confidence estimation (and as a result the order of the question-answer pairs) is completely random. Therefore, one way to determine how well a confidence estimation method works is to compare the two scores.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,120.41,587.92,6.00,10.80" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results of our three runs. Two observations can be made. First, the Web-supplemented runs (BBN2002B and BBN2002C) are significantly better than the base run (BBN2002A), confirming findings published in earlier studies <ref type="bibr" coords="5,434.69,615.40,67.56,10.80;5,90.20,629.20,25.80,10.80" target="#b3">(Dumais et al, 2002)</ref>. Second, our confidence estimation techniques work reasonably well: The confidence-weighted score is significantly better than the un-weighted score for all three runs. This is especially true for BBN2002C, where the difference between the weighted and the un-weighted scores is rather small.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We described our question answering work for the TREC2002 QA track. In particular, we have explored two problems: answer selection and confidence estimation. We found that some simple constraints can improve a pure IR-based technique for answer selection.</p><p>Our confidence estimation techniques used a few simple features such as question type, verb argument satisfaction, the number of question words matched by the answer context and the answer frequency in the retrieved Web pages. Performance scores show that our confidence estimation techniques work reasonably well. Our results also confirmed findings by other researchers that the Web is a useful resource for answering TREC-style factoid questions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,151.47,280.46,309.01,8.96"><head>Figure 1 Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1: P(correctness | F, INTREC), computed from training questions</figDesc></figure>
