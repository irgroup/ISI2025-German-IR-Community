<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Named Page Finding Task</head><p>Many years of research have been devoted to examining the question of what are the best retrieval strategies for retrieving information, this year we explore a variation on the task where a specific or knownitem is sought after given a query or topic. Our research this year specifically explores three basic questions about this task: How do document structure approaches compare to traditional ranking strategies given that the task and evaluation metrics have changed?</p><p>1. What type of document structure can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of this task, in comparison to traditional approaches?</p><p>2. How effective are weighted linear combination approaches to combining evidence from document structure retrieval approaches.</p><p>Many ranking strategies have been examined in the past. Three of the most studied algorithms are PDLN (Pivoted Document Length Normalization) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,279.85,680.52,10.64,11.03" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Okapi BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,363.13,680.52,10.64,11.03" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Self-Relevance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,450.82,680.52,11.67,11.03" target="#b2">[3]</ref> due to their effectiveness in prior TREC evaluations. In our calibrations, we have found BM25 to perform well so we use it as a baseline.</p><p>Some work has already been done on the extraction and storage of HTML term information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,507.88,83.65,10.64,11.03" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Additionally, much has been done with the use of link information to identify hubs and authorities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,507.93,95.17,10.63,11.03" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Since many content developers use HTML elements/tags to improve the readability of their documents, we hypothesize that simply using these tags may improve effectives. There are many different tags that could be used, (e.g.; title, section headers, anchor text, bold, underlines, comments, etc.), but we initially focus on only three types: title, anchor text and text.</p><p>Finally, we examine the fusion of different document structure indexes to produce a single ranked list for the know-item task. Those different document representations can be merged with linear combinations maximizing mutual evidence. When combining evidence we extend prior research of weighted linear combination approaches.</p><p>In recent years, the category of work known as data fusion or multiple-evidence described a range of techniques in information retrieval whereby multiple pieces of information are combined to achieve improvements in retrieval effectiveness. These pieces of information can take many forms including different query representations, different document representations, and different retrieval strategies used to obtain a measure of relationship between a query and a document. Several researchers have used combinations of different retrieval strategies to varying degrees of success in their systems <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.90,279.12,10.85,11.03" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.87,279.12,7.26,11.03" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Belkin, et al. examined the effects of combining several different query representations to achieve improvements in effectiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.82,302.16,10.82,11.03" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,158.66,302.16,7.22,11.03" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Lee examined the effect of using different weighting schemes to retrieve different sets of documents using a single query and document representation, and a single retrieval strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.27,313.56,15.35,11.03" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Fox and Shaw examined combination algorithms that increase the score of a document based on repeated evidence of its relevance, as done in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.21,348.12,10.63,11.03" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. One of the algorithms designed by Fox and Shaw, CombMNZ, has proven to be a simple, effective method for combining result sets. It was used by Lee in his fusion experiments, and has become the standard by which newly developed result combination algorithms are judged. More recent research in the area of meta-search engines has led to the proposal of several new result combination algorithms of even greater complexity, making use of training data and techniques such as voting algorithms and Bayesian inference <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.18,405.60,15.93,11.03" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.78,405.60,12.57,11.03" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.02,405.60,11.95,11.03" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Although these algorithms were shown to behave comparably and occasionally superior to CombMNZ, for our research we use Fox's CombMNZ algorithm, leaving other linear combination approaches as a topic of further research.</p><p>In the next section we describe our experimental approach to examine the above questions. In the results section we present our results from this year's experiments. Lastly, we conclude and present future possible research directions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>To conduct our research we use the IIT retrieval system AIRE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.83,526.45,15.40,11.03" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our system builds a traditional inverted index based on a given document structure(s). Additionally, our system uses conflation classes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.04,549.37,16.69,11.03" target="#b14">[15]</ref> instead of a more commonly used stemmer such as Porter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.89,549.37,15.37,11.03" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Those classes have been modified over the years as problem term variants have been encountered. Additionally, AIRE uses a generated statistical phrase list, where the statistical phrases were generated with a news collection and IDF filtering to reduce the final phrase list size. Phrases are generated from phrases via a bi-gram sliding window algorithm and weighted with 25% importance in relation to keyword weighting for retrieval. Basic term weighting uses the Okapi BM25, Equation 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>( ) (</head><p>) We indexed the 18GB government collection producing a full-text index, HTML title term index, and an anchor text index. The anchor text index differed from the other indexes, in that an additional mapping stage was required so referencing anchor text data can be linked to the referenced TREC document name. For our experimental layout we first produce a baseline run based on BM25, conflation classes, phrases, full-text index, referred to as the (base) run with the results summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,413.80,262.56,3.76,11.03" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,206.44,642.98,198.96,44.17">        + + + + *         + + - ∑ ) 3 ( * ) 1 3 ( * ) ( * ) 1 1 ( 5 . 5 . log qtf k qtf k tf K tf k n n N ) / * ) 1 (( * 1 avdl dl b b k K + - =</formula><p>Two additional result sets were created; the first one was produced using only the title index and the second produced from only using the anchor text index. With those three indexes and result sets our original three questions can be examined. With a baseline result set, additional document structure techniques can be compared in relation to each other (our first question). Our second question we briefly explore by examining anchor text and title text in relation to full text retrieval. In the next section we present results examining the effectiveness of the various structures and their combinations (our third question) with respect to baseline ad-hoc retrieval strategies.</p><p>Our linear combination is a three-step process. First our scores are normalized from each document representation retrieved set using min-max normalization, Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,362.91,389.04,3.76,11.03">3</ref>. The advantage of this method is that it preserves all relationships of the data values exactly. It does not introduce any potential bias into the data. Secondly, the final scores are calculated using CombMNZ, Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,394.48,412.08,3.75,11.03">2</ref>. Where each individual score is biased via alpha and beta weights assigned to the document structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equation 3: Min-Max Normalization</head><p>For our linear combination experiments we did not have relevance judgments, thus for our submitted runs we submitted runs based on guesses for the best weighting of linear combinations. Additionally, we limited the combinations of results and weighting to the experiment show in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,423.57,589.21,3.76,11.03" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Linear Combination Hierarchy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Our first sets of results examine the retrieval effectiveness of the various document structure elements. In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,115.59,374.17,4.98,11.03" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we see that the full text index significantly outperforms anchor and title indexes. This is not all that surprising given that anchor retrieval depends on the vocabulary of the referring text, thus not all documents have suitable referring text for the given query set. Similarly, title only retrieval is dependant on the author's vocabulary meeting the query language for this query set and is a subset of the vocabulary used for full text thus performing less than full text is not unexpected.</p><p>While the vocabulary for title and anchor text alone may not be as effective as full text for this task/query set, we further examine if combinations of the structures can improve effectiveness. In the second set of experiments we fused the title and full text indices with the CombMNZ algorithm with various alpha, beta weights for each document representation index. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,320.77,477.60,4.98,11.03" target="#tab_1">2</ref> displays the results of those experiments, while we did not have the final qrels, the run we chose ended up being the best combination of the two retrievals, (alpha=.2 and beta=.8) as highlighted in the table. Effectiveness improvements with any combination of full text and title text retrieval are not found. While a slight improvement is found in the top 10, this does not seem to be a significant improvement of any type. We then fused the combined evidence from (full text and title text) with anchor information and explored various weighting variables. Our submitted run, was the most effective in terms of MRR, but did not yield the greatest number in the top 10. Although the MRR is slightly worse than our full text approach, the number of correct results in the top 10 and "found" increased slightly. After receiving the relevance judgments from NIST we explored other various combination orderings, but found no improvements or negative effects for various orderings of fused results in retrieval effectiveness for all combinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Full</head><p>These results are surprising given that most popular search engines use document structure for improving the effectiveness of their services. While their improvements may come for other aspects of their approach, using the information as we did showed no significant advantage.  Our baseline full text retrieval approach for the known-item task was 58% of the time equal or above the median and 71% above the mean score of submitted runs. Additionally, our approach produced the item in the top 10 results 74% of the time and only missed the know-item 14% of the time with 150 queries. Our results using document structure marginally improved top 10 and found statistics, but did not improve MRR. These results are rather surprising in that the BM25 approach had been designed, tuned and tested for a different task and metric. While its success validates the robustness of the algorithm, more research needs to be conducted using document structure to determine how that information should be incorporated into the ranking strategy or that it does not benefit know-item retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Base</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Named-Item Summary</head><p>For TREC 10 we explored the use of linear combinations of term collections based on document structure features. Our goal was to examine the effects of different term collection statistics based on document structure in respect to known item retrieval. Our approach is to dissect a document into structural parts and build specific term indexes based on that document structure. Each of those indices would have their own collection statistics for term weighting based on the type of language used for that structure in the collection. For producing a single ranked list, we examined a weighted linear combination approach to merging results.</p><p>While our document structure linear combination experiments did not yield any promising results, our approach to known item retrieval was 58% of the time equal or above the median and 71% above the mean score of submitted runs. Additionally, our approach produced the item in the top 10 results 74% of the time and only missed 14% of the known-items out of 150 topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-lingual Track</head><p>In the Arabic track, we participated in Arabic Cross-language Information Retrieval (CLIR) and in Arabic monolingual information retrieval. We dedicated our effort to improve the retrieval effectiveness of Arabic monolingual retrieval, as we believe it is essential for any Arabic IR or CLIR systems. For the monolingual retrieval, we used two stemming algorithms. The first is a deeper light-based approach, and second is pattern-based approach. For the Arabic CLIR, we explored the retrieval effectiveness by using two recommended standard resources. The resources are a machine translation (MT) system and translation probabilities obtained from parallel documents collection provided by the United Nations (UN). The Arabic AIRE retrieval system is used for experimentation. We used the IIT similarity function and Rocchio relevance feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Unlike alphabets based on the Roman script, the orientation of writing in Arabic is from right-to-left. The shape of most of the characters depends on their position within a word and the character adjacent to them. Most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of roots. The root is the bare verb form; it can be triliteral, quadriliteral, or pentaliteral. Most of these roots are made up of three consonants. The Arabic language uses a root-and-pattern morphotactics; patterns can be thought of as templates adhering to wellknown rules. These patterns generate nouns and verbs. Roots are interdigitated with the patterns to form Arabic surface forms.</p><p>Arabic words are classified into three main parts of speech, nouns (including adjectives and adverbs), verbs, and particles. All verbs and some nouns are derived from a root. Arabic sentences are either verbal or nominal. Verbal sentences contain a verb before the subject, and may contain complements. Nominal sentences begin with a subject followed by a noun, an adjective, a prepositional phrase, or an adverb. In formal writing, Arabic sentences are delimited by commas and periods as in English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arabic Monolingual Retrieval</head><p>Unlike Indo-European languages such as English, the Arabic language is a highly inflected language. From an Arabic root, many surface forms can be derived. The surface forms of a word have a great impact on a language like Arabic with a strong morphology since surface forms comprise at least two morphemes: a three consonantal root conveying semantic meaning and a word pattern carrying syntactic information. Moreover, most connectors, conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns, and possession forms are attached to the Arabic surface form. Retrieving based on surface form results in low retrieval effectiveness as concluded in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,100.24,543.72,15.92,11.03" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,116.17,543.72,11.94,11.03" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Another strategy is to retrieve based on the root of the Arabic word. The goal of the root-based stemmer is to detect and extract the root of an Arabic surface word and it requires very deep syntactic analysis. Al-Shalabi <ref type="bibr" coords="6,123.66,589.68,16.71,11.03" target="#b18">[19]</ref> developed a system that detects the root and the pattern of Arabic words with verbal roots. Khoja <ref type="bibr" coords="6,117.16,601.20,16.71,11.03" target="#b19">[20]</ref> designed and experimented a novel algorithm for root detection. The retrieval based on the roots improves the retrieval effectiveness as compared to the surface form of the Arabic words. As in our earlier efforts <ref type="bibr" coords="6,123.43,624.24,15.87,11.03" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,139.30,624.24,11.90,11.03" target="#b17">18]</ref>, light stemming outperforms the root-based stemming. Therefore, light stemming approaches have potential promise <ref type="bibr" coords="6,230.81,635.76,16.72,11.03" target="#b16">[17]</ref> A deeper light stemming approach The aim of this algorithm is to conflate more related terms in a conflation class than the classes produced in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,100.99,681.72,15.33,11.03" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. To achieve this goal, we used a training corpus to identify the frequent suffixes and prefixes. The corpus was obtained from two Saudi Arabian newspapers, namely, Alriyadh and Aljazirah from the year 1999 to 2001. This corpus consists of more than one million words that cover a variety of subjects. The maximum length of the prefixes and suffixes is four letters and the minimum is two letters. Considering more than four letters as prefix of suffix results in ambiguous term after stripping them out. Also, one letter is not enough to form a valid suffix or prefix.</p><p>This automatic algorithm adheres to the following steps:</p><p>1-Check whether the given Arabic word is Arabicized, 2-Remove any diacritics in the given Arabic terms, 3-Start an aggressive normalization, 4-Check for the prefix Waw, 5-Check for duplicate prefixes, 6-Detect definite articles, 7-Check for suffixes, 8-Check for prepositions that attached to the given Arabic stem, 9-Check for prefixes, 10-Normalize the Alf-Maksorah and the Alf.</p><p>Throughout the above steps, each step is associated with an event, when the event occurs, an action will be taken. The algorithm checks the length of stem to decide whether to fire the associated action. The minimum length of the stem is three letters. Choosing three letters as minimum maintains the semantic of the Arabic word since most Arabic words are built up from three consonants. In Table <ref type="table" coords="7,442.76,302.16,4.98,11.03">5</ref> we describe some candidate suffixes that considered for removal that we obtained from corpus statistics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A pattern-based stemming approach</head><p>This approach uses patterns to detect the affixes of the given Arabic word. The algorithm starts first to match a pattern on the given Arabic word. For the case of liberal matching mode, if the matched letters are greater than one, then the algorithm considers that pattern as valid then prefixes and the suffixes will be removed. A more restrictive mode can be applied, i.e., increasing the number of matching between the given Arabic terms and the patterns to consider the current pattern for candidacy. The pattern-based algorithm adheres to the following steps:</p><p>1. Remove any diacritics in the given Arabic terms.</p><p>2. Normalization such as Alf, and Ya-Maksorah.</p><p>3. Check for the prefix Waw 4. Check for duplicate prefixes 5. Detect definite articles 6. Match the given Arabic term on a list of patterns. If there is at least one letter match in the given Arabic term, then the algorithm strips out the suffixes and prefixes of that term based on the matched pattern. If the algorithm fails to extract and remove the suffixes or the prefixes from the given Arabic terms, then the algorithm proceeds executing from step 7 to the end.</p><p>To clarify the roles of patterns in Arabic morphology, consider the root ( ‫آﺘﺐ‬ ). This root is transliterated as "ktb", which is measured with pattern ‫ﻓﻌﻞ(‬ ). The pattern ‫ﻓﻌﻞ(‬ ) is transliterated as "fàl". "f" corresponds to Table <ref type="table" coords="7,196.18,458.88,4.16,11.03">5</ref>: Some suffixes derived from the corpus the first letter ‫ف(‬ ), "à" corresponds to middle letter ‫,)ع(‬ and "l" corresponds to last letter ‫.)ل(‬ The pattern preserves f, à, and l in the same order, whereas vowels and other letters can be added to form a pattern. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,155.31,95.17,3.76,11.03" target="#tab_4">6</ref>, many patterns are derived from the base pattern "f à l" of the root "ktb". As shown, the pattern "f à alh" form the word ‫)آﺘﺎﺑﻪ(‬ by attaching the vowel ‫ا(‬ ) and letter ‫)ﻩ(‬ to the root "ktb". Locating the original letters of the given Arabic word in the pattern is essential step to remove the prefixes and suffixes.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,118.97,482.64,4.98,11.03" target="#fig_2">2</ref> illustrates the process of matching and stripping out the prefixes and suffixes. Before considering a suffix or prefix for removal, a matching process between the pattern and the given Arabic term is performed. For liberal matching, at least one letter from the pattern should match the Arabic term in same position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arabic Cross-language Information Retrieval (CLIR)</head><p>In the cross-lingual track, we experimented using the recommended standard resources that are provided by TREC for query translation. We used two means of query translations, machine translation system (MT) and the translation probability that are derived from the UN corpus via BBN <ref type="bibr" coords="8,397.53,580.45,15.41,11.03" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ajeeb MT system</head><p>Machine Translation systems can be defined as any computer-based system that seek automatically to transform a target text from one language into another language by using context information. One of the approaches being used for CLIR is using the existing machine translation system which usually involves automatic translation of the queries, from one language to another. We used ajeeb MT system (www.ajeeb.com) for translating the provided 50 queries (titles and descriptions) from English to Arabic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Translation probability</head><p>Translation probability means that if a term in the source language has several translations in the target language, each term in the target language gets probability. BBN construct translation probabilities that are   derived from parallel corpus. The parallel corpus was obtained from the United Nations (UN). The statistical machine translation GIZA++ was used to provide the transaction probabilities. The probability p(a|e) has several terms as candidate for translation, we selected the highest probability for each entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results Analysis</head><p>In Arabic monolingual retrieval, our results demonstrate the usefulness of using stemming in improving the retrieval precision. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,246.83,146.89,3.76,11.03" target="#tab_5">7</ref>, the initial investigation of the pattern-based algorithm, which is in the liberal mode, achieved an improvement over the deeper light stemming algorithm.</p><p>Deeper light stemming Pattern-based stemming Average Precision 0.3419 0.3473</p><p>In both stemming algorithm, some queries got as close as 0% measured in average precision. The reason behind this drop of retrieval effectiveness is that these queries have fatal error in spelling as well as some has ambiguous term. For example query number 32 got 0% measured in average precision.</p></div>

The reason behind this drop of retrieval effectiveness is that the construction of the translation probabilities is based on an aggressive stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="9,420.91,400.68,16.71,11.03" target="#b20">[21]</ref> which increases the chance of the co-occurrence of two different terms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CLIR Summary</head><p>We showed that stemming is an important approach to improve the retrieval effectiveness of any Arabic information retrieval systems. In TREC-2002, we participated in both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval. Our focus in this year is on the improvement of Arabic monolingual information retrieval systems. We presented a new automatic algorithm for stemming, namely, the pattern-based. We experimented with this algorithm by using the liberal mode. In future work, we plan to make it more restricted for matching the given Arabic word the pattern as well as to increase the number of patterns to enhance the rule-based operations of the algorithm.</p><p>In cross-lingual retrieval, we experimented with the standard resources that are provided via TREC11. We found that the machine translation system achieved superior performance compared to translation probabilities. One reason for is that the construction of the translation probabilities derived from the UN parallel corpus is based on an aggressive stemmer. In addition, some terms are not covered for translation. We plan to enhance the quality of the extracted parallel terms and to add more terms for wider coverage.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,205.00,695.17,108.15,11.03;3,90.04,85.96,30.46,8.96;3,90.04,94.70,248.75,12.98;3,90.04,106.82,237.62,12.98;3,90.04,119.06,104.13,12.98;3,90.04,131.30,148.40,12.98;3,90.04,143.54,213.56,12.98;3,90.04,155.78,228.18,12.98;3,90.04,167.90,51.80,12.98;3,90.04,180.14,135.07,12.98;3,90.04,192.38,428.10,12.98"><head>Equation 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Okapi BM25 Where: • tf = frequency of occurrences of the term in the document • qtf = frequency of occurrences of the term in the query • dl = document length • avdl = average document length • N = is the number of documents in the collection • n = is the number of documents containing the word • k1 = 1.2 • b = 0.75 or 0.25 (we use .25) • k3 = 7, set to 7 or 1000, controls the effect of the query term frequency on the weight --smaller is less.</figDesc></figure>
