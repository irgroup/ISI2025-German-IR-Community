<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The original goal for the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) TREC 2002 Interactive Track experiments was to perform some preliminary experiments comparing searching on tablet devices versus ordinary personal computers. Unfortunately, the vendor who had promised the devices we planned to use was unable to deliver them in time for the experiments. We therefore shifted our experimental focus to assessing user factors found in previous experiments to be associated with success, with a particular desire to assess the role of spatial visualization.</p><p>A variety of studies have demonstrated that spatial visualization is associated with successful computer use. Egan and Gomez have shown that spatial visualization is associated with two processes in text editing: finding the location of characters to be edited and generating a syntactically correct sequence of actions to complete the task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,368.32,438.53,12.64,10.46" target="#b2">[1]</ref>. Similarly, Vincente et al. have found that the ability to use a hierarchical file system is associated with spatial visualization as well as vocabulary skills <ref type="bibr" coords="1,193.32,466.13,12.74,10.46" target="#b3">[2]</ref>. In addition, Allen has demonstrated that this trait is associated with the appropriate selection of key words in searching <ref type="bibr" coords="1,319.97,479.93,12.75,10.46" target="#b4">[3]</ref>. We have previously found that the ability of medical and nurse practitioner students to answer clinical questions found spatial visualization to be highly predictive of success <ref type="bibr" coords="1,299.69,507.53,12.73,10.46" target="#b5">[4]</ref>. (Spatial visualization actually demonstrated multicollinearity with whether a searcher was a medical or nurse practitioner student, which may have been the actual predictive factor.) In previous TREC Interactive Track experiments, our results showed a trend towards spatial visualization being predictive of searching success in instance recall tasks, although they did not achieve statistical significance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,428.20,562.73,12.74,10.46" target="#b6">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Our methods employed the consensus approach agreed upon by track participants and posted on the track Web site (http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/t11i/guidelines.html). We used the .GOV Web collection created for the TREC 2002 Web Track as the searching data. The collection was accessed by using the Panoptic search engine. We followed the experimental protocol developed for the TREC-9 Interactive Track, which was designed to allow the comparison of two systems or system variants using a minimum of 16 searchers. Each searcher performed eight tasks, which are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="1,161.35,700.73,4.50,10.46">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Successful completion of the task was determined by evaluating the user answer. Since some questions required more than one answer (e.g., food products from the Netherlands), each user's search was assigned a score, with two points for a complete answer, one point for a partial answer, and zero points for wrong answer. The grading of results was done by an OHSU graduate student.</p><p>Since we were focused on user factors, our analysis was carried out on the level of searcher, not individual questions. A correlation matrix for the four major measurements (VZ-1 score, presearching score, post-searching score, and QUIS score) was built using Pearson's correlation coefficient with two-tailed testing for statistical significance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We recruited the minimum 16 searchers from students in the computer science program at Portland State University and the medical informatics program at OHSU. Experiments were carried out at a computer laboratory at OHSU using PCs running Microsoft Windows 2000 and the Internet Explorer version 5.5 Web browser, connected to the campus computer network, which was in turn connected to the Internet.</p><p>The general characteristics of the searchers are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,376.54,185.57,4.50,10.46">2</ref>. This group was highly experienced in computer use and Web searching, although they had lesser experience searching on-line public access catalogs and bibliographic indexes. They were highly experienced with searching related to their work, but less experienced searching in the searching tasks for this study, such as health, shopping, and government policy. The group unanimously reported Google as their preferred search engine.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,102.33,282.17,6.00,10.46">2</ref> -General characteristics of searchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristic</head><p>Average result Gender plotted versus post-searching score. The largest correlation was 0.405 for pre-searching and post-searching scores, with an associated p-value of 0.12. Thus, no variable would enter a regression model and therefore additional analyses were not warranted. In order for a correlation coefficient of 0.40 to be significant with 80% power and a two-sided 5% significance level, a sample size of 47 would be required. The sample size was thus too small for any meaningful interpretation. The data were similarly analyzed using a non-parametric approach and comparable results were obtained.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The OHSU results for the TREC 2002 Interactive Track showed some possible correlation between various user measures that did not reach statistical significance. Whether these measures were truly important could only have been assessed with a much larger sample size.</p><p>Statistical power is actually an overlooked challenge to evaluation of information retrieval systems. Even those carrying out batch-style evaluations must be concerned about it. Tague-Sutcliffe analyzed the results of the TREC-3 ad hoc experiments and found that the top half of the runs ranked by mean average precision had statistically insignificant differences with each other <ref type="bibr" coords="6,99.65,240.77,12.74,10.46" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. While Voorhees <ref type="bibr" coords="6,203.94,240.77,13.99,10.46" target="#b9">[8]</ref> has reassuringly found that results tend to keep their order even when different relevance judgments are substituted, Zobel has determined total recall is likely overestimated (i.e., additional relevant documents are likely to be found) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,424.06,268.37,12.87,10.46" target="#b10">[9]</ref>. In a related vein, Buckley and Voorhees analyzed the "stability" of results in batch studies and found a minimum of 25-50 queries needed to achieve it <ref type="bibr" coords="6,252.22,295.97,18.39,10.46" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</p><p>While most researchers who carry out evaluations in any field are probably familiar with statistical significance, which measures alpha error, and its meaning. Fewer research papers, however, report statistical power, which measures the minimization of beta error. Adequate statistical power is important in research, as an intervention in an experimental study may be of benefit, but the sample size is too small to tell. In fields such as medicine, the performance of "underpowered" clinical trials has been criticized, yet in many other experimental endeavors, researchers stop at reporting that results are "not statistically significant" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,423.86,406.37,18.39,10.46" target="#b12">[11]</ref>. Underpowered studies are a concern in TREC, especially given the nature of the venue, i.e., experiments performed on an annual cycle by research groups that do not generally have resources to carry out large-scale studies.</p><p>Another statistical challenge often overlooked in user-oriented IR evaluation studies is the nonindependence of results from individual questions or topics. That is, analyses carried out at the level of individual question must take into account the fact that such questions are not completely independent, in that users search on multiple questions. In our previous experiments, we had to employ more complex statistical analyses to when evaluating factors at the level of the individual question <ref type="bibr" coords="6,167.30,544.31,12.99,10.46" target="#b5">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,183.29,544.31,8.66,10.46" target="#b6">5]</ref>.</p><p>The results of our TREC 2002 Interactive Track experiments demonstrate that many measurable factors do influence the outcome of searching, but that sample sizes must be large enough to assess them well. The nature of the TREC experiments, with its short cycle for experimentation, can be at odds with adequately powered experiments. We hope to continue analyzing searchers once the .GOV collection has become stabilized.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,72.00,88.97,313.62,10.46"><head>Figure 1 -Figure 2 -Figure 3 -</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Scatter plot of VZ-1 score versus post-searching score.</figDesc></figure>
