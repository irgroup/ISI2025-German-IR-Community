<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and Motivation</head><p>Current search engines are typified as having a lack of precision, coupled with an elongated ranked list style of result presentation. When combined, these factors make relevant data extraction increasingly complex. The main investigation of our participation in the Interactive Track of TREC 2002 is to assess the effectiveness of new visualisation techniques for displaying the results of search engines.</p><p>Our current system, provisionally named HuddleSearch, uses a newly developed clustering algorithm, which dynamically organises the relevant documents into a traversable hierarchy of general to more-specific cluster categories. We have extended our TREC-10 summarisation tool to also allow the summarisation of multiple documents; whereby a summary paints a caricature of the contents of a cluster, rather than an individual document, thus allowing the user to provisionally judge a cluster's relevance prior to viewing its contents. The interaction between the user and the system is further developed by the aid of an information visualisation tool. Our primary assumption is that the combination of both hierarchical clustering and summarisation tools will aid users in their interaction with the system in the Web context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Systems</head><p>Our baseline system acts as a metasearch engine, providing a generic interface capable of displaying the results from any web search engine, simply by defining a wrapper specific to the baseline system. For the purposes of these experiments, we retrieve the results only from the provided Panoptic system<ref type="foot" coords="1,361.29,453.00,2.92,5.59" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , returning results solely from the .GOV domain. This system simply displays the title, a 200-character description and URL for each document, to provide the user with an element of familiarity with systems such as Google.</p><p>Our experimental system, HuddleSearch, extends the properties of our basic system, by enabling the user to find relevant documents quickly by means of navigating within a traversable hierarchy of clusters. When a user views a cluster title he or she gains an overview of the documents contained within it, and is then able to narrow in and view only the documents within a specified segmentation of choice, at a lower branch of the tree. In this way we address the problem of information overload; the user is able to reduce the relevant documents set by continually filtering out irrelevant documents in search of information satisfying their need.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,113.13,556.75,4.38,8.38">1</ref> shows the path between generality and specificity; where the retrieved set of documents contracts as the user progresses deeper into the cluster hierarchy. Unlike the flat clusters hierarchy of search engines like Vivisimo<ref type="foot" coords="1,503.01,564.96,2.92,5.59" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , WiseNut<ref type="foot" coords="1,118.89,574.92,2.92,5.59" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , or Grouper <ref type="bibr" coords="1,170.37,576.79,9.47,8.38" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, HuddleSearch organises the clusters into a hierarchy, providing a better structure for the result set. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,151.53,586.99,3.52,8.38">2</ref>(a) presents a screenshot of the system when used as a metasearch engine on the Web. The clusters are shown as folders at the top of the interface. The title of the folder is indicative of the cluster content and the number on the folder represents cluster size.</p><p>We have complemented the conception of a cluster hierarchy by investigating the use of query-biased summarisation, previously explored by the Glasgow Information Retrieval Group, to provide short passages indicative of individual document content <ref type="bibr" coords="1,152.61,642.91,9.47,8.38" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, we have extended this practice to allow the summarisation of multiple documents. In a similar way to the previous work, the summaries are created on-the-fly at retrieval time, prior to the results page being displayed. Hereby, we introduce the creation of cluster summarisation, where groupings of significant sentences extracted from documents within a cluster are combined to produce a summary indicative of a cluster's content. The chosen sentences are ones that have a high degree of match with the user's query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: A dynamic hierarchical clustering approach</head><p>In addition to the traditional hyperlink method for navigating between clusters, as used by WiseNut, we have devised a visualisation tool, which allows the user to preview the contents of any given cluster with only the slightest mouse movement. This feature has been combined with our cluster summarisation; whereby a user can view the summary of any cluster with ease. The two complementary features enable the user to quickly glance at the contents of available clusters, initially assess relevance, and then select a cluster of interest. Searchers therefore do not waste valuable time viewing misleading document sets. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,253.17,376.63,3.70,8.38">2</ref>(b) displays our visualisation tool, which provides the user with a summary of a cluster's content when the mouse touches a cluster and appears on the display to the right of the clusters.  Most users either work with or use computers for academic purposes frequently and have on average 5.7 years of websearching experience. With the exception of just 1 user, Google was cited as being the search engine of choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Presidents</head><p>Each user was required to carry out a total of 8 standard search tasks, equally split between the two systems. The tasks were allocated as required by the track guidelines to reduce potential learning effects and task bias. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,466.53,169.51,4.38,8.38" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the tasks carried out by participants.</p><p>Following the track guidelines this year, each user was allowed a maximum of 10 minutes for each task. They were asked to use the system presented to them, and to perform the allocated task. All user actions were logged. Moreover, users were allowed to browse away from the result list to any degree. Due to the open nature of the collection this year, users were free to browse/save documents that were not in the TREC .GOV collection. • You are planning to travel to the northeast territories of India and wonder if there are any problems/restrictions for tourists.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and Analysis</head><p>As mentioned before, all users actions were logged. Most of the data analysed in this section came from these logs generated by the system during the interaction with the users. All statistical tests of significance are at p ≤ 0.05, unless otherwise stated. M is used in this section to denote the mean.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task Completion</head><p>As part of the TREC post-task questionnaire, users were asked to state whether they felt they had successfully completed the task just attempted. We believe that ultimately, it is the user' s decision to state whether he completed a particular task or not. Indeed, this reflects real-life situations, where the purpose of any system is ultimately to satisfy the user. Roughly speaking, our assumption is that if a user has stopped the task within the 10 minutes allocated time, and said it has been successfully completed, it means the user is satisfied and the task is marked as completed. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,503.61,676.75,4.38,8.38">1</ref> shows the total number of failures for each system (out of 64).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1: Levels of task failure on each system</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline HuddleSearch</head><p>Total number of failures 15 9</p><p>Average number of failures 1.875 1.125</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,112.17,197.47,4.38,8.38">1</ref> shows that the number of incomplete tasks is clearly reduced by the use of the experimental system HuddleSearch. This shows that the clustering and summarisation features aid the users in their interaction with the system. However, paired T-tests revealed that the difference between the two systems was not significant (T 14 = 1.43, p = .195).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Task Times</head><p>The times taken to complete tasks on both systems were automatically measured from the user logs. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,471.09,266.83,4.38,8.38" target="#tab_1">2</ref> provides an overview of the performance of both experimented systems. A 60 second penalty is added when the task is incomplete. The systems calibration times are taken into account in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,360.81,286.99,3.32,8.38" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Indeed, while the average number of submitted query per task on each system is almost the same<ref type="foot" coords="4,310.05,295.20,2.92,5.59" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , HuddleSearch is on average slower (M difference = 9.7 seconds) than Panoptic in returning documents<ref type="foot" coords="4,251.97,305.28,2.92,5.59" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . Compared to the Panoptic search engine, used as a baseline in our experimental design, the times taken to complete search tasks using HuddleSearch have significantly fallen (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,345.21,421.39,4.38,8.38" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,369.45,421.39,3.17,8.38" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), especially for the first 5 tasks. On average, 74.4 seconds are saved per task using the HuddleSearch system. This difference is more marked for some tasks than others. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was run to test for a link between system, task and the associated time for each type of task. The results of this test showed that there was a significant difference between systems (F 7,112 = 7.16, p = .001), and a significant difference between tasks (F 7,112 = 9.34, p = .000). We found firstly that hierarchical clustering and summarisation visualisation techniques significantly help the users to locate quickly the relevant documents and secondly, that not all tasks were of equal difficulty. If we assume that task completion time is a reasonable indicator of task difficulty, then Task 1 (GR1 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,242.01,579.19,3.68,8.38" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) was significantly more difficult than any of the other seven tasks, across both systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">User Satisfaction</head><p>Overall, 13 out of 16 users preferred HuddleSearch to the baseline. Furthermore, as part of the post-task questionnaire, users were asked whether they were satisfied with the search results for each task. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,413.25,638.59,4.38,8.38" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows that users do feel more satisfied by the results provided by our hierarchical clustering system (M huddlesearch = 4.468 vs. M baseline = 4.219). However, these results are not significant using two-way, repeated measures ANOVA testing the effects of system (F 7,112 = .432, p = .764) and task (F 7,112 = .453, p = .717) on user satisfaction. The degree of user satisfaction is not significantly different between systems.</p><p>Given the very encouraging results we obtained for the tasks completion, the average completion times, and user satisfaction, we wanted to investigate what could improve the overall effectiveness of HuddleSearch. We propose some possible explanations as to why the system was not optimally efficient.</p><p>Firstly, Panoptic, the baseline search engine returns a document result set consisting of documents fully matching the query, followed by a set of results only partially relevant to the query (results are presented in tiers, in Panoptic terminology). When a user makes a request for precise information and asks for 300 pages to be returned, Panoptic might simply return 3 fully relevant documents, which are then occluded by a further 297 only partially relevant and not fully satisfying the query. In this way, many of the base clusters created may be too generic, and relevant to only a subset of the query terms, thus not aiding the user in his search.</p><p>A cluster is fundamentally a common group of terms; this has proved to conflict with Panoptic, which often returns mirrors of the same document several times. At this moment in time, HuddleSearch simply examines the URL to determine replication; consequently 'false' significant clusters are created when content is repeated, this will result in incorrectly weighted common phrases and will hide naturally relevant clusters which are pushed further down the list.</p><p>In order for a cluster summary to be created each page within a cluster is visited and its content is retrieved to generate a page summary. Some experiments were executed at peak times, where network traffic was high; hence many documents failed to be summarised within an allocated time. As a result, when documents failed to be summarised, the higher-level cluster summaries were inadequate and occasionally users were faced with 'no summary could be created' , providing little or no benefit to the user. However, informal feedback from users during non-peak time evaluations suggests that summaries are indeed helpful.</p><p>In addition to viewing a cluster summary, our visualisation tool provides the facility of previewing a cluster by looking at its top documents titles, which we believe to be good indicators for judging initial relevance. However, the .GOV collection made this feature extremely temperamental, as in many cases a document' s title is simply an alphanumeric document ID, thus providing no hint of content.</p><p>The above perhaps explain why the user satisfaction with HuddleSearch, though superior to the Panoptic engine, was not optimal. Moreover, the assessment of the answers provided by the users during the experiments will provide more evidence regarding the effectiveness of HuddleSearch. However, we do believe that most of the issues mentioned above could be addressed efficiently. Hence, we suggest that there is much scope to improve HuddleSearch. Overall, results show that hierarchical clustering and summarisation visualisation tools do aid the users in their interaction with the search engine in the Web context. Uncompleted tasks as well as average times to accomplish them were definitely reduced by the use of HuddleSearch.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,87.69,609.25,37.91,10.16;2,152.61,609.25,126.59,10.16;2,374.01,609.25,97.91,10.16;2,87.69,407.03,260.04,195.12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2 (a): HuddleSearch interface (b): Cluster summary</figDesc><graphic coords="2,87.69,407.03,260.04,195.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
