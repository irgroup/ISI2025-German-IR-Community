<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="0.">Introduction</head><p>In TREC-2002 experiments, we carry out the topic distillation and the named page finding tasks. A modified Okapi weighting scheme is implemented in our search engine. The modification is to replace the original parameter K which is the length of a passage by the parameter K' which is the norm of the passage. We also propose a proximity re-ranking method. In this method, documents covering more query terms in a certain window size than documents having fewer query terms within the same window size are ranked higher. The PageRank of a document is combined with the similarity of the document before or after proximity re-ranking to obtain an overall ranking of the document. In topic distillation, a document is assigned a value which is the sum of its similarity and a weighted sum of the similarities of its descendents within the same host. For each host, the document that gets the highest value among documents belonging to the same host is chosen for final ranking. In named page finding, the title and the anchor text are used to construct a surrogate index. We submit one run that combines the document similarity with the surrogate similarity.</p><p>In section 1 of this paper, we present the indexer, the weighting schemer, the proximity re-ranked feature and the linkage analysis. In the next part, we discuss the specific technique we used for the distillation task and the named page finding task. The paper is concluded in section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">System Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">System and Data Structure</head><p>In this section, an overview of our system is given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>(1) Document Parser It is responsible for robust parsing of HTML/SGML documents. This includes HTML/SGML parsing, tokenization, lower case conversion and stemming.</p><p>(2) Indexer</p><p>The indexer reads collection files from disk, decompresses the documents, and parses them. For each document, the system assigns a document ID, stores the content words (word ID) and their positions within the document. For each appearance of the content word, its type (title, anchor or plain) is identified. The information is held in a forward index file, in descending order of document ID. The lexicon will be kept in a separate file. The lexicon file contains all the words and their corresponding IDs. The indexer also extracts linkage information between documents and maintains it by using two tables: one keeps track of, for each document, the set of documents it points to; the other keeps track of, for each document, the set of documents pointing to it.</p><p>(3) Inverse Indexer</p><p>The inverse indexer reads the forward index file and sorts it by word ID to generate an inverted index.</p><p>An index of the inverted index is produced which contains, for each word, the word ID and its offset into the inverted index.</p><p>A document is partitioned into passages, each having at most 300 words including stop words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Structure</head><p>(1) Forward Index Documents in the forward index are in ascending order of document ID. One complete record is as where t is the number of distinct terms in the document; tf i is the term frequency within the document; for docID i1 in (position, type[, docID i1 ]), if the word type is anchor, the word is logically associated with the document with docID i1 ; otherwise the docID i1 is omitted.</p><p>(2) Inverted Index Ordered by word ID, the word record is as follows:</p><p>Word ID, df, (docID, normWeight) ….. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,259.28,370.62,91.72,9.72">(docID, normWeight)</ref> where df is the document frequency of the word; docID and normWeight are the document and the normalized term weight of the word in the document respectively.</p><p>There are exactly two forward index files and two inverted index files, one for documents and another for passages.</p><p>(3) Outgoing Link File and Back Link File Ordered by document ID, the outgoing link record is as follows: Document ID, t, docID 1 , docID 2 , …, docIDt where t is the number of outgoing links; documents with IDs: docID 1 , docID 2 , … docID t are pointed to by document ID.</p><p>The back link file has the same format, but the docIDs are associated with the back links of the given document.</p><p>(4) Document Index Document index table, implemented as a fixed length ISAM file and ordered by document ID, contains, for each document, document ID, document name, its URL, its length, its norm, its PageRank (see section 1.4) and entries to various files: forward index file, outgoing links file, and back links file.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Search Engine</head><p>In the current system, once the search engine is fired up, several data structures are populated and resident in main memory. This includes (a) a hash table holding lexicon; (b) a set holding a list of stop words; and (c) a search map holding the index of the inverted index. The search map is implemented as sorted pairs of (word ID, offset), where the offset indicates the starting position where the inverted index for the word with word ID is located on the disk.</p><p>A memory resident lexicon and search map enables fast lookup of inverted file and is critical to the efficiency of our search engine.</p><p>All the processing is done on a Dell computer with 2.0G Pentium processor and 1GB RAM. This machine runs Linux.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Weighting Scheme</head><p>We adopt the Okapi weighting function in our system <ref type="bibr" coords="4,318.60,361.02,89.08,9.72" target="#b5">[RobertsonWalker00]</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,90.00,391.02,408.60,135.71">Basic Weight Function qtf k qtf k tf K tf k w Q T + × + × + × + × ∑ ∈ 3 3 1 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( ) 1 ( (1) ) 1 ( w is the Robertson/Spark Jones weight of T in Q [RobertsonSpark76], which is: 5 . 0 5 . 0 log + + - n n N (2)</formula><p>where, N is the number of items (documents/passages) in the collection n is the number of documents/passages containing the term tf is the frequency of occurrence of the term within a specific document/passage qtf is the frequency of the term within the query</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,92.40,643.40,292.20,27.60">) ) 1 (( 1 avgdl dl b b k K × + - × = , 1000 75 . 0 2 . 1 = = = k b k</formula><p>Documents retrieval uses the basic okapi function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modified Okapi Function for Passages Retrieval</head><p>Passages retrieval uses a modified okapi function where each passage has up to 300 words including stop words (the last passage of a document may have less than 300 words).</p><p>We modify Okapi function by replacing the original parameter K with K', where K' is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,111.00,166.40,160.80,27.60">K' = k 1 × ( (1-b) + b× AvgNorm Norm )</formula><p>Here the Norm is the norm of the passage, the AvgNorm is the average norm of a passage in the collection. k 1 , b, k 3 are 1.2, 0.75 and 1000 respectively. We use the Norm and AvgNorm instead of the traditional length factor for the reason that passages differ more in norms than in lengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Proximity Feature</head><p>We take the proximity of query terms into consideration in retrieval. Specifically, if the largest number of query terms which can be found in a document within a certain window size (50 words) is m, then m is called the proximity factor. Supposed that the similarity of the document computed by the basic/modified Okapi function is sim, then an intermediate similarity of the document is (m, sim).</p><p>Documents are arranged in descending order of (proximity factor, similarity) with proximity factor being the leading coefficient. That is, if document d 1 has intermediate similarity (p 1 , sim 1 ), and document d 2 has intermediate similarity (p 2 , sim 2 ), then document d1 will be ranked higher than document d 2 if p 1 &gt; p 2 , or p 1 = p 2 and sim 1 &gt; sim 2 .</p><p>After TREC competition, we do more experiments on proximity. We are investigating the effect of window size on retrieval efficiencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">PageRank</head><p>We compute the PageRank of each document according to <ref type="bibr" coords="5,366.00,529.62,56.00,9.72" target="#b0">[BrinPage98]</ref> [PageBrinMotwani98]</p><p>[Havelinwala99].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Retrieval Documents/Passages Retrieval</head><p>Documents are retrieved in descending order of basic okapi similarity. Let the similarity between document d i and query q be normalized to value between 0 and 1 and be denoted by sim(di, q).</p><p>The basic search engine also retrieves the passages in descending order of the modified okapi similarity. The similarity of a document containing a set of passages in the list is the maximum similarity of a passage within the document. Let sim(p k , q) represent the similarity value between passage p k and query q, p i1 , p i2 , …, p it be passages belonging to the same document d i . The similarity of document d i between query q is normalized between 0 and 1 and is given by: sim(d i , q) = max( sim(p i1 , q), sim(p i2 , q), …, sim(p it , q) ) (3)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ranking Documents by Proximity</head><p>After the similarities of documents are computed according to formula (3), they are re-ranked in descending order of (proximity factor, similarity) as described in section 1.3. The (proximity factor, similarity) is normalized to a value between 0 and 1, and this value is denoted by inter-sim(d, q).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combine PageRank</head><p>We combine the PageRank value of each document with sim(d, q) or inter-sim(d, q) to aim at the final similarity [SilvaRibeiro-Neto00].</p><p>Combine with PageRank:</p><p>final-sim(d, q) = a * sim(d, q) + (1-a) * PageRank 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 or final-sim(d, q) = a * inter-sim(d, q) + (1-a) * PageRank 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 (4)</p><p>In the above expression, PageRank is normalized to a value between 0 and 1.</p><p>The BaseSet of documents are the top N documents obtained by formula (3), or re-ranking using proximity or formula (4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distillation Algorithm</head><p>In the BaseSet, the documents within each host are used to compute their qualities. This takes into considerations of: a. The final similarity of each document within the host b. The linkage information among the documents in the host.</p><p>(1) We first construct a graph as follows. A BaseSet of 1000 documents which have the largest similarities was obtained. This set is augmented by another set of documents S'. Each document, say d' in S' is a parent of a node d in S, and d' and d belong to the same host. Hyperlinks between documents on the same host form the directed edges of the graph.</p><p>(2) We now compute the quality of a document. It is essentially the sum of its final similarity and a weighted sum of the final similarities of its descendents within the same host. It is computed as follows.</p><p>Let N be the set of nodes in the parenthood graph; Let q[n] be the quality value of node n in N, and s[n] be its final similarity value.</p><p>a. Initialize q[n] to 0; s[n] = 0 if n does not belong to S, s[n] = its similarity value if n is in S.</p><p>b. For each node n in set N, compute its shortest path to each of its descendents, m. Let the length of the shortest path be d</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="7,126.00,345.42,252.83,61.70">[n, m]. d[n, m] = 0 , if m = n. c. q[n] = ∑ ∈ n of descendant N m m n d m s _ _ ) ,<label>( 2 ) (</label></formula><p>(3) Rank the documents in descending order of quality. Return the 10 documents with the largest qualities, provided that no more than 1 document comes from the same host. In other words, if document d 1 and document d 2 come from the same host and d 1 has higher quality, then discard d 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result</head><p>For topic distillation task, 4 BaseSets are constructed:</p><p>The first BaseSet contains documents retrieved using passage retrieval only.</p><p>The second BaseSet contains documents obtained using passage retrieval but with proximity take into consideration (section 1.3).</p><p>The third BaseSet contains documents obtained using passage retrieval, proximity and combined with PageRank.</p><p>The fourth BaseSet contains documents retrieved using document retrieval combined with PageRank.</p><p>Notice that this year's TREC topic distillation task only judges the top 10 retrieved documents. So in our submission, for each query, top 10 documents are from distillation, and the remaining documents are from BaseSet.</p><p>The best result is obtained by applying distillation algorithm to the third BaseSet, we get 52 key resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Named Page Finding</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surrogate Index and Retrieval</head><p>Since title and anchor text are very important in homepage finding, we treat them in a special way and generate separate index set of title and anchor text for afterward retrieving. The title and anchor text will be indexed as follows:</p><p>(1) For each HTML page p, extract its title T.</p><p>(2) For each HTML page p, construct a set S of anchor texts associated with the link in the Web pages that have link(s) pointing to p. For example, if page q has a link pointing to p, e.g. on page q there is &lt;a&gt; href=http://www.dbis.uic.edu&gt;UIC database and information xxx Web site&lt;/a&gt; and page p is dbis's web site. Then "UIC ..." is the anchor texts for page p. Note that it is extracted from page q.</p><p>(3) For each HTML page, construct a document surrogate from all the tokens in T and S.</p><p>(4) Index surrogates as we described in section 1.1.</p><p>For a given query each retrieved document will have a surrogate similarity. Then it is combined with the original document similarity to get the final similarity. The procedure is as follows:</p><p>(1) Compute the similarity of query q with surrogate: sim(q, surrogate-of-doc)</p><p>(2) Interpolate its similarity with the original document p, to get final similarity: c * sim(p, q) + (1-c)* sim(surrogate-of-p, q)</p><p>(5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result</head><p>We submit 3 runs for named page finding task.</p><p>The first run is obtained from the surrogate as described in formula (5).</p><p>The second run is obtained by combining document retrieval with PageRank.</p><p>The third rum is obtained using passage retrieval only.</p><p>The best i s the third run, the average reciprocal over 150 topics is 0.564, the number of topics for which the named page found in top 10 is 114 (76%), the number of topics for which no named page was found is 20 (13.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conclusion</head><p>Our TREC-2002 experiments show that passage retrieval is beneficial to both topic distillation and named page finding. Proximity ranking can improve the precision of content retrieval. Linkage information (PageRank) helps both tasks. But unfortunately, the surrogate (title and anchor text) does not give us a good performance in named page finding task. Since this is the first time we participate in TREC, we do not have the time to try more sophisticated techniques. We are experimenting with new techniques to perform retrieval, which hopefully will yield much better effectiveness in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,90.00,141.42,34.35,9.72;3,90.00,165.42,66.00,9.72;3,126.00,183.42,36.10,9.72;3,162.00,187.68,3.60,6.48;3,165.00,183.42,12.00,9.72;3,177.00,187.68,3.60,6.48;3,180.00,183.42,234.60,9.72;3,126.00,202.02,36.10,9.72;3,162.00,206.28,3.60,6.48;3,165.00,202.02,12.10,9.72;3,177.00,206.28,3.60,6.48;3,180.00,202.02,234.70,9.72;3,126.00,220.02,10.80,9.72;3,126.00,238.02,36.10,9.72;3,161.40,242.28,2.00,6.48;3,163.20,238.02,11.70,9.72;3,175.20,242.28,2.00,6.48;3,177.00,238.02,234.76,9.72"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>tf 1 , (position, type[, docID]), …., (position, type[, docID]) Word Id 2 , tf 2 , (position, type[, docID]), …., (position, type[, docID]) … Word Id t , tf t , (position, type[, docID]), …., (position, type[, docID])</figDesc></figure>
