<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The problem of finding answers to questions on a large document collection, could in principle be solved by creating a knowledge base with the information extracted from documents and then querying such knowledge base. Unfortunately this approach is not yet feasible, since it requires advanced techniques of natural language processing, knowledge extraction, knowledge representation and reasoning, which are beyond the current state of the art.</p><p>On the other hand, Information Retrieval techniques are quite effective in retrieving documents relevant to a certain subject, so in particular those which might contain the answer to a question. Information Extraction techniques help identifying certain kinds of information, but their capabilities are quite domain dependent and limited to entities with predefined patterns. Neither of these techniques is sufficient to address the Question Answering problem, but we have explored a way of combining them to build a complete question answering system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The approach</head><p>The meaning of a document might be expressed in terms of entities and relations between them. Entities are the semantic equivalent of nouns present in the document, while relations correspond to verbs. For example, the information contained in the following phrase: "John reads a book" can be represented by means of the entities "John" and "book", and by the relation "reads" that links subject and object. Relations need not be binary: prepositional phrases and various kinds of syntactic adjuncts allow expressing n-ary relations.</p><p>Intuitively an entity refers to an object in the real world or to a concept, or in general to an element of the semantic domain of the document contents. In this semantic domain entities have attributes and are related to other entities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.19,98.63,50.76,13.28">[Attardi 86</ref>]. Within documents only syntactic representations of the entities are present, expressed in one of several forms: Our system tries to locate the syntactic boundary of each kind of entity expression and, in the first two cases, it attempts to solve the references. The architecture of our system consists of an Entity Tagger, which performs a superset of the functions of a Named Entity tagger, and a coreference module (of still limited capabilities in our prototype).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity Tagger</head><p>The Entity Tagger works mainly at the syntactic level, exploiting features provided by lexical analyzers, like part of speech tags, cases, gazetteers and contexts rules.</p><p>For example, given the phrase "The TREC-9 Conference was held in Maryland in November 2000" the Entity Tagger produces: &lt; TREC-9 Conference&gt; was held in &lt;Maryland&gt; in &lt;November 2000&gt;.</p><p>The Entity Tagger is capable of dealing with structured entities. Numeric dates, Web addresses, numbers, monetary expressions are examples of structured entities, which are expressed according to specific syntactic rules. Suitable Information Extraction modules are invoked in a pre-processing stage of the Entity Tagger in order to recognize structured entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic Tagger</head><p>Having determined the syntactic boundaries of an entity, the system tries to classify it according to a predefined semantic ontology, i.e. it tries to assign to each expression the proper semantic category of the referred object.</p><p>For example, given the phrases: &lt;Washington&gt; is in &lt;North America&gt;.</p><p>&lt;George Washington&gt; didn't like &lt;apples&gt;. &lt;Washington&gt; threatens &lt;Iraq&gt; to start &lt;the war&gt;.</p><p>the semantic tagger is capable of disambiguating the three senses of the term "Washington" within each phrase, classifies each occurrence accordingly, and produces: To perform classification, the semantic tagger exploits a thesaurus and a set of context rules, which allow inferring the semantic category of any entity (not just of a Named Entity). The semantic ontology used for classification is a two level tree extracted from the is-a relation of the WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,502.25,201.23,52.74,13.28">[WordNet]</ref> thesaurus. In its general form, a context rules states that if the context surrounding an entity matches a certain syntactic pattern and certain conditions on semantic attributes of the entities involved are met, then the context provides evidence that the entity belongs to a certain semantic category, expressed as a numeric weight. For example, the rule in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,251.35,403.19,4.51,13.28">2</ref>, applied to fragment "John is the chief director of …", states that the entities &lt;John&gt; and &lt;the chief director&gt; most likely have similar meanings. Entity classification is probabilistic based: the semantic tagger computes the likelihood that an entity belongs to each semantic category, and selects the category with the highest likelihood. The pair of an entity instance and its semantic category makes what we call a concept, for instance 〈George Washington, PERSON〉.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Indexing and retrieval</head><p>Our QA system is based on a concept-oriented indexing and search engine which stores the concepts extracted from documents using IE techniques. The underlying intuition is that both the documents relevant to a question and the question itself must be about the same semantic objects. Therefore documents are indexed according to the semantic entities extracted from them, and they are searched then through to the semantic entities extracted from queries. We expect the search will match only a small set of documents, strictly related to the question, within which to focus further search for the answer, since it is most likely that they contain such answer.</p><p>This document-filtering step has also efficiency benefits, since it reduces the number of documents that must be considered in subsequent steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Architecture</head><p>The overall architecture of PISAB Question Answering System is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,472.26,683.87,4.67,13.28" target="#fig_2">3</ref>  The learning subsystem extracts concepts from documents (i.e. semantic classified entities), by means of the semantic tagger. Concepts are used as indexes for the analyzed documents in a document retrieval system. The first step in the answering phase is to extract concepts from the question. Then a query for the document retrieval system is constructed, made up from these concepts, but with different weights assigned to each concept according to its role in the question. For example, a concept that seems to be the focus of the question is weighted more than one that is not. (The focus is a concept that describes semantically the answer entities. For example: in "What U.S. President did …" the Question Focus is "U.S. President" and the AnswerType is PERSON). This is done by analyzing the question and building an abstract representation of it consisting of several semantic slots, including: To increase the robustness of document relevance ranking we combine concept weighting with a traditional IR scoring function: the cosine distance between the text and the query. Adding such termrelated score mitigates the effects of errors in entity extraction and classification. The query is finally expanded by means of a thesaurus, including variants of concepts and terms present in the question, for improving matching likelihood.</p><p>The expanded query is used to retrieve documents relevant for the question. The most relevant ones, according to the search engine rank, are further analyzed in order to extract the candidate answers. We split the document into paragraphs (or sentences) and rank them according to an estimate of relevance to the query. We have a concept occurrence, also called a "semantic hit", when a paragraph contains an inflection of a question's concept or an entity with the same semantic category of the Question Focus Each occurrences is weighted according to the associated semantic slot and all weights are added up to obtain a score for each paragraph. Finally, from each top ranked paragraph we extract the best scoring text window: this will be one of the candidate answer to be displayed to the user, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,385.33,695.75,4.50,13.28" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,152.56,84.83,306.96,13.28;3,162.52,112.43,286.92,13.28;3,86.80,140.03,438.48,13.28"><head>[</head><label></label><figDesc>Washington/LOCATION ] is in [North America/LOCATION].
