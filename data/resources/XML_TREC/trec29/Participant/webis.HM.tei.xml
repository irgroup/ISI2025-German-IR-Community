<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Search results that contain wrong, unreliable, or misleading information can be harmful to searchers who take the information for granted-especially in scenarios of health search. e Health Misinformation track at TREC 2020 focuses on information needs like "Can ibuprofen worsen COVID-19?", for which the results might lead searchers to wrong decisions that negatively a ect their health. Our approaches to the Health Misinformation track scenario attempt to rank documents higher that provide correct and justi ed information from credible sources.</p><p>We submi ed ranked result lists using the Elasticsearch-based search engine ChatNoir <ref type="bibr" coords="1,146.35,467.99,9.52,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which indexes the Common Crawl News corpus using BM25F <ref type="bibr" coords="1,158.75,478.95,14.85,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref> as the retrieval model and preprocessing the raw WARC les to extract the main content and the metadata such as keywords, headings, host names, etc. Based on this baseline retrieval system, we submi ed the following seven runs: (1-2) two runs using either the topic's title or its description as the query to ChatNoir, (3) one run based on axiomatic re-ranking <ref type="bibr" coords="1,285.80,533.74,9.23,7.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.59,544.70,6.29,7.94" target="#b3">4]</ref>, and (4-7) four manual runs based on manual pilot judgments that are used to automatically formulate keyqueries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MANUAL PILOT JUDGMENTS</head><p>In a manual pilot judgment phase (six minutes per topic), we tried to obtain a small number of documents with correct answers for each topic. Our motivation is to use the manually identi ed documents as "target" documents for the automatic keyquery formulation in our keyquery-based runs.</p><p>Four annotators did the pilot judgments using the same annotation instructions. ree of them got 10 non-overlapping topics each and one got the remaining 20 topics. e annotators' task was to identify at least two documents which most likely provide a correct answer to the question / topic title. e annotators started by carefully reading the full topic: title, description, answer, evidence, and narrative-to understand which documents would provide correct answers to the described information need. en, the annotators used the web interface of ChatNoir to identify documents with potentially correct answers. ey were allowed to formulate their own queries (i.e., re-formulating the topic titles that were given as questions) and were instructed to look only at the ChatNoir result page and to not click any links (i.e., only result URLs, titles, and snippets were shown). e snippets contained up to 300 characters with query term highlighting by Elasticsearch's functionality.</p><p>Given the restricting timing constraints (six minutes per topic), we did not ask our annotators to assess a documents' credibility but only whether the content is likely to be correct given the topic description. Although the annotators were allowed to stop as early as they had identi ed 2 target documents, we collected 3 target documents per topic on average (maximum of 11 target documents for Topic 41: Hib vaccine COVID-19).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="1,351.12,534.93,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the o cial Health Misinformation track judgments for the target documents from our pilot judgments compared to all Health Misinformation track judgments for all runs submi ed by any participant to the TREC 2020 Health Misinformation track. Our pilot judgments show a pre y good quality even though only the URLs, titles, and snippets were inspected by our annotators given some limited time budget: 84% of our target documents are judged as useful. However, only 63% of our target documents provide the correct answer (compared to 41% correct answers in the results of all submi ed runs). A critical observation is that the pilot judgments' "accuracy" advantage over all runs diminishes with the complexity of the quality criteria. Although the pilot judgments achieve a much higher "usefulness" score (50 percentage points advantage), we the advantage decreases for "correct answers" (22 points advantage), and almost diminishes for "credible" documents (3 points advantage only). is indicates that our pilot judgments could not support the assessment of a result's credibility: a document's URL, title, and short snippet, that our annotators were allowed to use, are simply not su cient but the whole content is needed for a proper assessment (e.g., sources of claims given in a document, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">WEBIS RUNS</head><p>We submit seven runs that can be divided into the three groups: (1) baseline retrieval with ChatNoir, (2) axiomatic re-ranking with argumentative axioms, and (3) manual runs based on pilot judgments. All runs use the BM25F-based search engine ChatNoir <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.37,198.38,9.39,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline Retrieval With ChatNoir</head><p>We used ChatNoir <ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.49,233.25,10.52,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as the basis for all our runs. ChatNoir leverages a large-scale Elasticsearch cluster with 130 nodes to o er a freely-accessible search interface for the two ClueWeb and two Common Crawl snapshots, about 5 billion web pages altogether. 1  We used ChatNoir's pipeline to index the Common Crawl News documents by processing the raw WARC les using main content extraction, language detection, and metadata extraction (keywords, headings, host names, etc.). During retrieval, we used ChatNoir's existing weighting scheme for the two Common Crawl snapshots, which combines the BM25 scores of multiple elds (title, URL, keywords, main content, and the full document). We used the ChatNoir REST API for all our runs.</p><p>We submi ed two standalone ChatNoir runs and ve runs that use ChatNoir for initial retrieval before re-ranking. e rst Chat-Noir run uses only the title as a query and the second run uses the description as a query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Argumentative Axiomatic Re-ranking</head><p>We created and submi ed one run based on a re-ranking of the top-20 initially retrieved ChatNoir results using argumentative axioms. We largely apply the same re-ranking strategy used in our previous TREC participation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.43,465.38,9.33,7.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,138.00,465.38,6.22,7.94" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Identifying Argumentative eries.</head><p>Based on the assumption that users issuing argumentative queries, i.e., queries that demand justi cation of the retrieved information, might prefer documents containing argumentation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.41,514.69,9.27,7.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.93,514.69,6.18,7.94" target="#b3">4]</ref>, we rst identify which of the Health Misinformation track's topics are argumentative. For this, we manually inspected all topics. Given their medical COVID-19-related nature, we concluded that all of them could be labeled as argumentative queries (i.e., relevant results containing some form of argumentation might be perceived as more relevant/helpful).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Re-ranking Axioms.</head><p>To re-rank the top-20 ChatNoir retrieval results, we use the three axioms which re-rank argumentative documents higher from our previous years' Common Core and Decision track contributions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.28,618.80,9.33,7.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.86,618.80,6.22,7.94" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Retrieval axioms (i.e., formally de ned constraints applied to retrieval models) have been developed within the axiomatic thinking in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.52,651.68,10.56,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to de ne some algorithmic heuristics which good retrieval models should ful ll. Traditionally, such constraints were developed to account the relevance of retrieved 1 We have indexed the 2015 and 2017 snapshots available at: h ps://commoncrawl.org documents to the respective queries. e basic example is the termfrequency axiom TFC1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.33,97.76,9.29,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which states that given two documents of the same length and a single-term query, the document with more occurrences of the query term should receive a higher ranking score from any query-document scoring function. We follow the ideas of axiomatic thinking and address the argumentative nature of queries and documents by using the three axioms that capture document argumentativeness (and which were also used in our previous TREC submissions). Note that we relax the precondition of document length equality to ensure the axioms' applicability to real web documents. We formally de ne our axioms as follows:</p><p>Axiom ArgUC (Argumentative Units Count). e general idea of the ArgUC axiom is to favor documents that contain a larger number of argumentative units.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 be an argumentative query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two retrieved documents with count Arg (𝐷 1 ) and count Arg (𝐷 2 ) argumentative units counts in documents, and let ≈ 10% indicate "equality" up to a 10% di erence. If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and count Arg (𝐷 1 ) &gt; count Arg (𝐷 2 ), then rank(𝐷 1 , 𝑄) &gt; rank(𝐷 2 , 𝑄).</p><p>Axiom QTArg ( ery Term Occurrence in Argumentative Units). Retrieved documents usually consist of argumentative and nonargumentative units or text passages.</p><p>e general idea of the QTArg axiom is to favor documents where the query terms appear closer to argumentative units.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 = {𝑞} be an argumentative single-term query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two retrieved documents, and let 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 be the set of argumentative units of a document 𝐷. If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and 𝑞 ∈ 𝐴 𝐷 1 for some 𝐴 𝐷 1 ∈ 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 1 but 𝑞 ∉ 𝐴 𝐷 2 for all 𝐴 𝐷 2 ∈ 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 2 , then rank(𝐷 1 , 𝑄) &gt; rank(𝐷 2 , 𝑄).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Axiom QTPArg ( ery Term Position in Argumentative Units).</head><p>Following the general observation that in relevant documents the query terms occur closer to the beginning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,471.54,447.25,13.42,7.94" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.21,447.25,10.07,7.94" target="#b13">14]</ref>, the QTPArg axiom favors documents where the rst appearance of a query term in an argumentative unit is closer to the beginning of the document.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 = {𝑞} be an argumentative single-term query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two retrieved documents, and let the rst position in an argumentative unit of a document 𝐷 where the term 𝑞 appears be denoted by 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 ). If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 1 ) &lt; 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 2 ), then rank(𝐷 1 , 𝑄) &gt; rank(𝐷 2 , 𝑄).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Argumentative Unit</head><p>Detection. e three argumentative axioms are based on argumentative units in documents. To detect argumentative units, we use the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF argument tagging tool TARGER <ref type="bibr" coords="2,382.02,597.45,10.53,7.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that is available via an API. 2 TARGER takes as input a raw text and returns markers indicating the beginning and the end of argument premises and claims (argumentative units).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Actual Run.</head><p>In addition to the three argumentative axioms, we also employ the axiom ORIG <ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.58,646.56,13.39,7.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which simply returns the preferences of the baseline retrieval system's ranking-BM25(F). We do this to balance between document argumentativeness and relevance to avoid more argumentative but less relevant documents being ranked higher. e four di erent axioms (including ORIG) are weighted to linearly combine the respective preference matrices following the original axiomatic re-ranking pipeline <ref type="bibr" coords="3,278.56,257.23,13.49,7.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>e weight of an axiom then directly in uences its impact on the document re-ranking. For simplicity, we apply the argumentative re-ranking vs. original ranking axiom weighting strategy, such that document positions in the initial ranking are swapped i all three argumentative axioms agree to overrule the ORIG preference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Manual and Keyquery Runs</head><p>Four manual runs employ the target documents identi ed in the pilot judgments.</p><p>e rst manual run simply moves the target judgments identi ed in the pilot judgments to the top of ChatNoir's ranking for the title query. e other three manual runs use the pilot judgments as target documents to formulate keyqueries <ref type="bibr" coords="3,282.75,390.73,9.51,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Slightly extending the original de nition <ref type="bibr" coords="3,207.84,401.69,9.51,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we view a query as a keyquery for a given target document set i it retrieves at least 𝑚 of the target documents in the top 𝑘 of at least 𝑙 results. e parameter 𝑙 controls the level of the keyqueries' generality, the parameter 𝑘 its t to the target documents. We set 𝑘 = 20, 𝑙 = 25, and 𝑚 = 1 to ensure that we nd some keyqueries that each retrieve new documents and do not over t by retrieving exactly the target documents only.</p><p>Our target documents labeled manually are intended to be useful and to correctly answer the question formulated in a topic. Our hypothesis is that keyqueries retrieve documents similar to the target documents at high ranks. is hypothesis is motivated by the usage of keyqueries in scholarly search, where they are e ective for retrieving related work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,153.69,544.16,9.39,7.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>To create candidate keyqueries, we leverage Elasticsearch's term vector API using two strategies. In the rst approach, for each individual target document for some topic, we extract the ve terms with highest BM25 scores on the main content eld. With these 5 terms, we formulate all 32 possible combinations (2 5 = 32) as keyquery candidates per target document. In the second approach, we select from the combination of the topic's target documents the eight terms with the highest BM25 scores and formulate all 256 possible combinations from these terms as candidate keyqueries. In both approaches, we verify all candidate queries and remove candidates that are not keyqueries for the target documents (parameters set to 𝑘 = 20, 𝑙 = 25, and 𝑚 = 1).</p><p>We use a greedy algorithm for combining the identi ed keyqueries to produce the runs. Starting with a topic's set of target documents from our pilot judgments, we select the keyquery with the highest nDCG (just considering the target documents as relevant) and remove the retrieved documents from the set of target documents. We iteratively select the query with the highest nDCG on the remaining target documents until the set of target documents is empty. We combine the selected keyqueries using the topic's title (or, respectively, the description) as additional query with team-dra -interleaving <ref type="bibr" coords="3,426.41,342.09,13.49,7.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which produces two keyquery runs.</p><p>Additionally, we also submit a run that contains a mixture of lower-ranked documents retrieved by our keyqueries. From these lower-ranked results, we removed all target documents since this run should simply ensure that su ciently many new documents retrieved by our keyqueries are judged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EVALUATION</head><p>In the Health Misinformation track, the retrieval e ectiveness of the submi ed rankings is evaluated with novel compatibility measures and multiple variants of nDCG <ref type="bibr" coords="3,433.33,464.63,9.41,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To this end, NIST assessors labeled the usefulness, correctness, and credibility of documents. e compatibility measure combines these three aspects into preference orderings for the document helpfulness and harmfulness.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,353.85,508.46,4.24,7.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows our submi ed runs and the o cial BM25 baselines in a "compatibility" plot. With only the title as the query, our ChatNoir baseline systems produces more harmful rankings than the BM25 baseline while for the descriptions as queries, the Chat-Noir rankings are slightly more harmful and also less helpful than the o cial baseline run. Axiomatically re-ranking the ChatNoir results with the title as query has minimal e ects on the compatibility (helpfulness and harmfulness slightly decrease). But moving the target documents from the pilot judgments to the top of ChatNoir's title ranking substantially increases the helpfulness, while formulating keyqueries for the pilot judgments increases helpfulness and reduces harmfulness at the same time.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,351.16,639.97,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows our runs and the o cial baselines ordered by compatibility along with the nDCG scores for all aspects judged by the NIST assessors. With a compatibility focus, our keyquery run with pilot judgments produces a more helpful and less harmful ranking than the o cial BM25 baselines. But evaluating the ranking e ectiveness with nDCG shows a di erent picture: our runs have worse nDCG scores than the o cial BM25 baselines for all aspects and the combination of the aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>To participate in the TREC 2020 Health Misinformation track, we submi ed runs falling into three types: ChatNoir-based baselines using the topic title or the topic description as queries, and several re-ranking approaches with argumentative axioms and with keyqueries based on manual pilot judgments. Our re-ranking approaches aim to move useful and credible documents with correct answers to the top of the initial ChatNoir BM25F rankings. e results show that the pilot annotation purely based on documents' URLs, titles, and snippets is challenging. Our pilot annotators were able to identify relevant documents from the searcher perspective, but could not reliably distinguish between credible and non-credible documents.
