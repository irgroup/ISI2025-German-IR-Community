<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Search engines represent a powerful tool for end-users to find information related to different topics easily and quickly <ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.82,468.35,9.47,7.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The results provided can, however, often be unreliable <ref type="bibr" coords="1,240.49,479.31,9.49,7.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, inaccurate <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.80,490.26,9.38,7.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, or of poor quality <ref type="bibr" coords="1,135.29,490.26,9.37,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Results with any of these attributes can be referred to as examples of misinformation.</p><p>Misinformation can have a greater or lesser impact depending on the topic, but it is especially sensitive when it comes to healthrelated content, as Pogacar et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,181.94,534.10,10.68,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> proved in their user study. Medical hoaxes, miracle diets, or advice provided by unqualified people abound in all digital media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,176.35,556.02,9.27,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These contents can be highly dangerous if taken as true and applied without professional medical supervision <ref type="bibr" coords="1,97.49,577.94,9.27,7.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This has become particularly evident in the context of the pandemic we are facing in 2020, with substantial information about COVID-19 being either dubious or of poor quality <ref type="bibr" coords="1,265.06,599.85,13.36,7.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The TREC 2020 Health Misinformation Track focuses on misinformation related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding of this disease is constantly evolving, so tracking objective information should be based on developing a retrieval system able to return scientific accurate documents.</p><p>In this report, we explain the characteristics of the runs submitted by our team, CiTIUS, for the TREC 2020 Health Misinformation Track, and discuss our results. Our runs represent an exploratory approach to leverage existing labelled data to build a reliability classifier <ref type="bibr" coords="1,352.24,296.33,10.55,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and to test it with TREC Health Misinformation data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DOCUMENTS AND TOPICS</head><p>In the TREC 2020 Health Misinformation Track, a news corpus from January 2020 to April 2020 was provided. The documents were obtained from CommonCrawl News, which contains news articles from all over the world.</p><p>Topics attempt to model how people search for health advice online. Fifty topics with a fixed structure were provided. All include number, title, description, answer, evidence, and narrative, as it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,379.71,409.71,3.01,7.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The title field has the form of a pair of treatment and disease, where the disease is always COVID-19. The description is formulated as a question, which contains treatment, effect, and disease. The answer corresponds to the medical consensus at the time of topic creation. Finally, the remaining fields were not intended to be used by the systems, but only by human assessors to produce qrels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RETRIEVAL BASELINE</head><p>For indexing and processing the collection, we considered different state-of-the-art tools, such as Terrier <ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.72,523.08,14.59,7.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="1,506.39,523.08,13.22,7.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, we decided to use Anserini <ref type="bibr" coords="1,420.60,534.04,13.22,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which is Lucene-based, but offers practical advantages to support the needs of this track.</p><p>For all the runs, the title field was used to produce the search query. We decided to use a bag-of-words approach, where at least one term or clause must match for a document to appear in the results. We selected a classical BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,459.32,588.84,14.85,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> approach, setting normalisation parameter (𝑏) to 0.75 and TF weight upper-bounded limit (𝑘 1 ) to 1.2. The first retrieval baseline was generated using Pyserini<ref type="foot" coords="1,348.34,619.56,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , Anserini's Python implementation. This facilitated the integration with the rest of the elements in our technology (our reliability classifier is also developed in Python).</p><p>The baseline was combined with other techniques, such as BERT sentence-similarity or our reliability classifier in order to produce a final estimation of the presence of misinformation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RELIABILITY CLASSIFIER</head><p>In previous research <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.32,337.61,9.27,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we developed a predictive technology able to distinguish among reliable and unreliable web documents, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. To that end, three different Web Search datasets were used: Sondhi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,101.64,381.44,9.44,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Schwarz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.77,381.44,13.41,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and CLEF eHealth consumer health task 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.25,392.40,13.24,7.94" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Each of these collections contains web pages related to the field of health, but the second dataset additionally features pages related to politics, finance, environment, and news about famous people.</p><p>Although the Schwarz et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.45,436.24,14.85,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and CLEF eHealth <ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.66,436.24,14.85,7.94" target="#b15">[16]</ref> collections were labelled in terms of credibility and trustworthiness, respectively, we considered these concepts as proxies of reliability for our experiments.</p><p>Our main goal was to build a document-level classifier using a standard supervised learning approach. More specifically, we followed the methodology designed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,198.56,501.99,9.49,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this previous work, webpages were represented following a number of features, namely:</p><p>• Link-based features: the number and type of links are usually a good indicator of the type of website we are dealing with <ref type="bibr" coords="2,96.92,548.07,13.50,7.94" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,112.67,548.07,10.13,7.94" target="#b17">18]</ref>. For example, as Sondhi and his colleagues exposed, a more reputable or reliable site tends to have more internal links, while a less reliable site tends to have more external links and advertisements <ref type="bibr" coords="2,193.36,580.94,13.24,7.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. On the other hand, the presence or not of privacy or contact links can be an indicator of reliability. This is because the presence of these types of elements gives a sense of confidence to the user who consults the resource <ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.54,624.78,13.60,7.94" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.47,624.78,10.21,7.94" target="#b20">21]</ref>. However, nowadays most unreliable sites replicate these characteristics with great success.</p><p>Based on these criteria five features were defined to be taken into account: normalised value of internal links, normalised value of external links, normalised value of total links, the presence or not of contact link (boolean), and the presence or not of privacy link (boolean). For the latter two, the original paper did not explain how they had been computed.</p><p>Therefore, we manually defined two list of privacy<ref type="foot" coords="2,522.62,85.64,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and contact <ref type="foot" coords="2,355.79,96.60,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_2">3</ref> expressions, such as Privacy Policy or Contact Us, after performing a first exploratory analysis over the documents. For normalisation, the original authors analysed a random sample of documents and they experimentally chose a large normalisation denominator (the link count was divided by 𝑍 1 , which was set to 200). • Commercial features: the presence of commercial interest often indicates a low reputation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.25,175.46,13.60,7.94" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,485.12,175.46,10.21,7.94" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Therefore, two characteristics have been defined to be taken into account: the normalised value of commercial links and the normalised frequency of commercial words on the website.</p><p>For the latter, an initial list of indicative words of commercial interest was proposed in the article. Our contribution was to manually extend it by adding more words <ref type="foot" coords="2,514.20,239.07,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . Since the original article was not explicit about word preprocessing, we followed a naive approach, in which a word must match exactly with some word in the list to be taken into account for the final metric. This strategy can be improved in future versions by applying lemmatization techniques, for example.</p><p>Regarding normalisation, the normalised value of commercial links was obtained dividing by the same 𝑍 1 used above.</p><p>The second feature consisted of dividing the number of commercial words found by the document length. • Word-based features: textual content and style are often good indicators of a website's reliability or reputation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,545.58,361.77,13.61,7.94" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.36,372.72,10.11,7.94" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Therefore, each word in a document was considered as a different dimension, taking its normalised frequency score. Since the original authors did not declare the use of any preprocessing stage, we applied no stemming or lemmatization. Similarly, we considered two alternative pre-processing strategies, with and without stopword removal. To this aim, the NLTK <ref type="foot" coords="2,364.36,436.33,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_4">5</ref> English stoplist was manually extended <ref type="foot" coords="2,513.80,436.33,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_5">6</ref> after some preliminary exploration over the documents. Finally, for each word we divided the number of occurrences of the word by the document length.</p><p>Besides testing the feature sets in isolation, we also tested a final combination that merged all features together. Moreover, we tested two variants: one with word features extracted with stopword removal and another one with word features extracted with no stopword removal.</p><p>When performing the experiments, a vector support machine was used as a learning method. More specifically, we employed Python's implementation of SVMlight<ref type="foot" coords="2,458.72,559.83,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_6">7</ref> . To compare the different feature sets, we used a weighted accuracy metric and, in case of a tie, the F1-metric of the minority (non-reliable) class was given priority.</p><p>To determine the best reliability detection features, a stratified 5fold cross validation strategy was used with each dataset (except for the Schwarz et al. collection, which is very small and, thus, we used a 2-fold cross validation).</p><p>Experiments with all three datasets suggested that the best reliability detection models were those based on word features or based on combining all features together. Keeping or not stopwords had a slight impact on performance. However, this impact varied among each dataset. More details about the metrics used and the experiments can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.08,142.59,9.39,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we built a model for each collection and its best feature combination. Given a test document, Equation 1 determined its final class, where 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝐶𝐿𝐸𝐹, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑆𝑜𝑛𝑑ℎ𝑖 and 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑧 are each model's prediction for the test document and the weights were set to the relative size of these three training collecions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,60.07,224.91,233.98,22.27">𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑑𝑜𝑐) = 0, 97 × 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝐶𝐿𝐸𝐹 + 0, 027 × 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑆𝑜𝑛𝑑ℎ𝑖 + 0, 006 × 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑_𝑆𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑧 (1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SUBMITTED RUNS 5.1 Total Recall Task</head><p>In this task, the main goal was to retrieve documents that promulgated misinformation. To that end, documents contradicting the topic's answers were assumed to be misinformation. We submitted three different runs or solutions to this problem. The first one (CiTIUSCrdTot) applied the BM25 retrieval baseline described before. After that, we ranked the 𝑛 retrieved documents based on our reliability classifier's output (ranked by increasing reliability) and we kept the top ten thousand non-reliable documents in the ranking. We are aware of this being a naive method (it ignores the matching between the description field and the retrieved pages, and just estimates misinformation based on the reliability of the entire page). In any case, we thought it was a natural baseline against which more sophisticated baselines could be tested.</p><p>The second run (CiTIUSCrdRelTot) applied the same strategy, but it also used a voting method, Borda Count <ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.34,456.32,13.49,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, to combine both rankings, relevance and reliability, and kept the top ranking documents.</p><p>The last run (CiTIUSSimTot) was the most sophisticated variant. A hand-crafted expression was created for each topic by combining description and answer fields. An example could be Vitamin D cures COVID-19, since we are looking to promulgate misinformation. After obtaining the title-based BM25 baseline, we ranked the 𝑛 retrieved documents based on maximum sentence similarity between the new hand-crafted expression and all sentences in each document (where sentences were represented using BERT). To this aim, we used Sentence Transformers <ref type="foot" coords="3,210.52,574.72,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_7">8</ref> Python library, which offers several pre-trained models for embeddings generation, and then we applied cosine similarity between sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">AdHoc Retrieval Task</head><p>Unlike the previous task, here the main goal was to recover correct information. To that end, sites supporting the topic's answers were assumed to be relevant. We submitted four different runs or solutions to this problem.</p><p>The first one (CiTIUSCrdAdh) applied the BM25 retrieval baseline described before. After that, we ranked the 𝑛 retrieved documents based on our reliability classifier's output but, in this case, we promoted highly reliable sites (the top thousand documents were kept from a ranking of documents organized by decreasing reliability).</p><p>The second run (CiTIUSCrdRelAdh) applied the same strategy, but it also used a voting method, Borda Count <ref type="bibr" coords="3,496.50,164.51,13.49,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, to combine both rankings, relevance and reliability, and kept the top ranking documents.</p><p>The third run (CiTIUSSimAdh) consisted of producing a handcrafted expression for each topic by combining description and answer fields. An example could be Vitamin D does not cure COVID-19, since we are looking to promulgate correct and relevant information. After obtaining the title-based BM25 baseline, we ranked the 𝑛 retrieved documents based on maximum sentence similarity between the new hand-crafted expression and all sentences in each document. As in the previous task, we used the Sentence Transformers library and cosine similarity.</p><p>Finally, the last solution (CiTIUSSimRelAdh) applied a sentencesimilarity strategy again. However, it also used Borda Count to combine both rankings, relevance and similarity. The R-Precision results for the total recall task are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,339.49,491.17,3.03,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. All our methods performed worse than the median performance of the participants in the task. The classifier-based strategy (CiTIUSCrdTot) was the worst performer. It appears that this word-based document-level classification is too rough (and perhaps biased towards the topical words used in the training data). It must also be noted that the estimation of relevance combined with the reliability classifier (CiTIUSCrdRelTot) yields to better performance than the reliability classifier alone. This suggests that relevance estimation should be kept as an integral part of the system. The embedding-based approach (CiTIUSSimTot) worked better than the classifier-based strategy but we did not combine it with any relevance information (because we could only submit three official runs). We expect that the combination of CiTIUSSimTot with relevance information leads to further benefits in terms of performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Runs</head><p>CAM_MAP_three Organizers designed specific measures to account for these aspects (e.g. CAM_MAP_three), but they also evaluated runs in terms of traditional relevance measures (e.g. NDCG).

The CiTIUSSimRelAdh run, which combined BERT-based similarity with the relevance ranking, produced our best results. The classifier-based variant was our worst performer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The TREC 2020 Health Misinformation Track focused on COVID-19 misinformation. To solve this problem, we presented different simple strategies.</p><p>We developed a document-level reliability classifier using previously annotated Web Search datasets. However, this strategy generalized poorly when applied to TREC data. We additionally proposed a naive sentence similarity solution based on BERT. This solution seems to perform better, but it is nevertheless still too simple.</p><p>Finally, it must be noticed that combining relevance output to any of the previous strategies improves the final performance.</p></div>
