<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The task of TREC 2006 Genomics Track is to retrieve passages (from part to paragraph) from full-text HTML biomedical journal papers to answer the structured questions from real biologists. A system for such task needs to be able to parse the HTML free-texts (convert the HTML free-texts into plain texts) and pinpoint the most relevant passage(s) within documents for the specified question. This task is accomplished in three steps in our system. The first step is to parse the HTML articles and partition them into paragraphs. The second step is to retrieve the relevant paragraphs. The third step is to identify the most relevant passages within paragraphs and finally rank those passages. We are interested in 1. How does a concept-based IR model perform on structured queries comparing to Okapi? 2. Will the query expansion based on domain knowledge increase retrieval effectiveness? 3. Will our abbreviation database from MEDLINE help improve query expansion and will the abbreviation disambiguation help improve the ranking? The experiment results show that our concept-based IR model works better than the Okapi; query expansion based on domain knowledge is important, especially for those queries with very few relevant documents; an abbreviation database for query expansion and disambiguation is helpful for passage retrieval.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Step 1: HTML parsing and document partitioning.</head><p>The HTML full-text journal articles use special symbols to represent Latin characters. For example, the Latin character β can be written as "&amp;#223" or "&amp;szlig". Since this kind of Latin characters are commonly used for naming genes, it is important to translate them into plain texts (e.g., replace "&amp;#223" with "beta"). We used the ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) characters list for the translation.</p><p>Sometimes GIF files are used to represent the Latin characters. For example, the HTML tag &lt;IMG SRC="/math/12pt/Large/beta.gif" ALIGN=BASELINE ALT="beta"&gt; is used in one of the articles to represent β. Notice that term "beta" is included inside the HTML tag and special processing is needed in the tag handler of the HTML parser. In the end, step 1 will partition each document into paragraphs according to the HTML &lt;p&gt; tag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Step 2: Paragraph retrieval</head><p>This step retrieves the top 2,000 most relevant paragraphs, which will be used as the input of step 3 for passage retrieval. Several techniques have been conducted in this step. These techniques are explained in detail in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Conditional Porter stemming</head><p>Stemming is employed to recognize variants of the same word, which will also reduce the number of terms indexed. Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.45,376.01,11.02,8.22" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is widely used in IR community. To determine whether this stemmer is suitable to process biomedical texts, we applied it to both the queries and documents and examined the following two aspects:</p><p>1. How are the query words stemmed? 2. What are those words that are equal to the query words after they are stemmed?</p><p>We observed that Porter stemmer is suitable in most of cases except the following two: Case 1: A gene name in the query is changed into a totally different non-gene word after stemming. For example, the stemmer changes gene "Pes" to "Pe". Gene "IDE" is stemmed into "ID". Case 2: A non-gene word becomes a gene name after stemming. For example, "IDEE", after stemming, becomes the gene "IDE".</p><p>Gene names in the queries are very important biomedical concepts. The performance of an IR system could be extremely degraded if the above two cases happen. To utilize the Porter stemmer and avoid the above two cases, we employed a conditional stemming strategy. With this strategy, whether a word should be stemmed or not depends upon both the original word and the potential stemmed word. Given a word w, we classify w into the following 3 categories:</p><p>1. G: gene names. This category is further divided into two sub-categories: G 1 : gene names ended with numbers (e.g., "HNF4") and G 2 : gene names not ended with numbers (e.g., "APC"). 2. E: regular English words 3. N: neither gene names nor English words.</p><p>w is a gene name if it is in the Entrez Gene database. w is an English word if it is in the WordNet dictionary. w could be both a G and a E, for example "shot" is a common English word and also a gene name. The conditional Porter stemming strategy is given as follows: suppose a word w is potentially stemmed into w' by the Porter stemmer. Stemming is skipped if any of the following conditions is satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,84.90,152.01,169.58,34.05">1) w ∈ G 2) (w ∈ E) ∧ (w ∉ G) ∧ (w' ∈ G 2 ) 3) (w ∈ N) ∧ (w' ∈ G 2 )</formula><p>There is an exception for condition 3. We observed that the stemming "GSTMs" → "GSTM" is acceptable, in which w ∈ N, w' ∈ G 2 , w' is ended with an uppercase alphabetic character, and w = w' + s. This exception is only for "s" because usually the plural of a gene name is formed by adding an "s" at the end of the gene name. Condition 1 will guarantee that case 1 be avoided. Condition 2 will make sure case 2 does not happen for English words. Condition 3 will avoid case 2 for words that are neither gene names nor English words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Handling lexical variants of gene names</head><p>New gene names and their lexical variants are regularly introduced into the biomedical literature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.25,339.89,10.24,8.22" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.23,339.89,6.83,8.22" target="#b2">3]</ref>. However, many reference databases, such as UMLS and Entrez Gene (formerly named as LocusLink), may not be able to keep track of all this kind of variants. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.24,372.35,10.25,8.22" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.27,372.35,7.87,8.22" target="#b4">5]</ref> have demonstrated that expanding gene names with their lexical variants will improve the performance of information retrieval of bio-medical literature. In our system, the lexical variants of a gene come from two sources: 1) automatically generated according to a usual strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.74,426.47,10.24,8.22" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.93,426.47,7.87,8.22" target="#b4">5]</ref> based on the features of the guidelines for human gene nomenclature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.45,448.07,10.18,8.22" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; 2) or retrieved from an abbreviation database created from MEDLINE. Here we only explain the 2 nd strategy.</p><p>ADAM <ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.90,480.54,11.00,8.22" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is an abbreviation database which covers frequently used abbreviations and their definitions (or long-forms) within MEDLINE titles and abstracts, including both acronyms and non-acronym abbreviations. An important feature of ADAM is that morphologically similar abbreviations are clustered together. For example, "5HT" is an abbreviation for "5-Hydroxytryptamine". ADAM shows that "5-Hydroxytryptamine" could be abbreviated as "5-HT", "5HT", "5-ht", "5-Ht", and "5-H-T" in the literature. This feature of ADAM could be used to find extra lexical variants of gene names, other than those that are automatically generated.</p><p>A gene abbreviation could have a non-gene long-form. For example, gene "APC" could be an abbreviation for "Air Pollution Control". To find the lexical variants of a gene abbreviation, we first need to know what the longform of the gene is. This is accomplished either by extracting the long-form from the queries themselves or searching the Entrez Gene database.</p><p>After the long-form of the abbreviation gene is identified, we search the long-form in ADAM. Suppose the abbreviation gene is "PRNP" and we identified "Prion protein gene" as the long-form from the Entrez Gene database. From ADAM, we find "PRNP" and "Prion protein gene" is an abbreviation/long-form pair and "Prion protein gene" could be shortened as "Prnp", "prn-p", or "prnp" ("PRNP", "Prnp", and "prnp" are the same after tokenization). Notice that "prn-p" will not be automatically generated by the 1 st strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Utilizing domain knowledge</head><p>Domain knowledge is critical for query expansion. A biomedical term may have many different ways of saying it. For example, "high blood pressure" and "hypertension" refer to the same vascular disease. "hypocretin-2 receptor" and "orexin B receptor" are two different ways of saying the same receptor. This phenomenon is very common in the biomedical literature. Acquisition and utilization of this kind of domain knowledge will be very useful for retrieving more relevant documents. We define a concept as a biomedical meaning or sense <ref type="bibr" coords="2,486.47,274.19,10.05,8.22">[8]</ref>. We consider 1) a gene and its synonym set refer to the same concept. 2) a medical subject heading (MeSH) and its synonym set refer to the same concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Identifying query concepts</head><p>A query usually contains several concepts. For example, the query "purification of rat IgM" has 3 concepts: "purification", "rat", and "IgM". This section will describe how to automatically identify concepts from a query. A concept, in our system, could be a gene name or a MeSH term. Basically we need to identify gene names and MeSH terms from a query. The gene names, in the queries of the genomics track of TREC 2006, are already specified by the query templates <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.27,425.63,9.97,8.22" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. To extract the MeSH terms from a query, we utilize the PubMed Automatic Term Mapping <ref type="bibr" coords="2,375.73,447.29,14.50,8.22">[10]</ref>. Given a query, we submit the whole query to PubMed. PubMed will then return a file in which the MeSH terms in the query are marked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Retrieving concept information from biomedical thesaurus</head><p>For each MeSH term, the MeSH database gives its synonyms, hypernyms (more generic terms), and hyponyms (more specific terms). For each gene name, we retrieve its synonyms from the Entrez Gene database. We also collected 22,446 gene names from the UMLS (they are concepts that map to "Gene or Genome" semantic type). Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Finding related concepts</head><p>Related concepts (not synonyms, hypernyms or hyponyms), in some cases, could be very useful. For example, a query is asking for the information about "the gene HNF4 and COUP-tf I in the suppression in the function of the liver". We observed that some relevant documents in the 2005 document collection are talking about the role of "HNF4" and "COUP-tf I" in regulating "hepatitis B virus" transcription. However, "hepatitis B virus" is known as a virus that could cause serious damage to the function of liver. The relationships among these three concepts could be described as A ↔ B ↔ C where "↔" indicates the two concepts on two sides are related. In the above example, A is the "HNF4" and "COUP-tf I". B is "hepatitis B virus" and C is "liver". The query is asking for A and C, but the relevant document is about A and B. Queries from TREC genomics track were collected from real biologists. Some of the queries represent the information needs of their latest research. There may be very few relevant papers exist in the literature. Related concepts could be very useful for this kind of queries. This issue is very related to <ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.44,198.00,15.75,8.22" target="#b9">[11]</ref> for identifying implicit relationships between two disjoint literatures.</p><p>A semantic type is a category assigned to concepts based on their intrinsic and functional properties <ref type="bibr" coords="3,262.58,230.46,14.47,8.22" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. We require the related concept B be related to A and C not only in free-texts (i.e., B co-occurs frequently with both A and C in the documents), but also on the semantic level (i.e., the semantic type of B interconnects with both the semantic type of A and the semantic type of C).</p><p>For any concept X, let S(X) be the set of semantic types of X in the UMLS semantic networks. Given two concepts A and C, algorithm 1 describes a method of finding the related concepts B: Algorithm 1 Finding related concepts 1. U ← the semantic types that are related to both T 1 ∈ S(A) and T 2 ∈ S(C) 2. B 1 ← the concepts that co-occur with A in free-texts 3. B 2 ← the concepts that co-occur with C in free-texts 4. B ← B 1 ∩ B 2 5. Filter B by removing X with X ∈ B and S(X) U</p><p>The size of B could be very big. In practice we only need those concepts that are most related to A and C. For each X ∈ B, we assign a score which will be used to indicate the association of X with A and C. Given two concepts C 1 and C 2 , we use the mutual information <ref type="bibr" coords="3,105.28,494.70,15.75,8.22" target="#b11">[13]</ref> to measure their association:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,113.82,506.36,147.30,22.02">1 2 1 2 1 2 ( , ) ( , ) log ( ) ( ) p C C I C C p C p C = ×<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where p(C 1 ,C 2 ) is the joint probability of C 1 and C 2 , and p(C 1 ) and p(C 2 ) are the probabilities of C 1 and C 2, respectively. Given a concept X, its probability p(X) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,161.40,565.53,49.98,20.30">( ) ( ) f X p X N =</formula><p>where f(X) is the document frequency of concept X (i.e., the number of documents that mention X).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Given two vectors</head><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,76.80,656.70,219.29,19.86">V 1 = [x 1 , y 1 ] and V 2 = [x 2 , y 2 ], we say V 1 ≺ V 2 or V 1 is not greater than V 2 if x 1 ≤ x 2 and y 1 ≤ y 2 .</formula><p>For each X ∈ B, a score is assigned based on its vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,92.16,690.42,186.81,24.56">{ ' : ' and ( ') ( )} ( ) { '': '' and ( ) ( '')} X X R V X V X score X X X R V X V X ∈ = ∈ ≺ ≺ (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="3,278.97,699.18,3.65,8.22">)</formula><p>The numerator is the number of the vectors in R that are not greater than X and the denominator is the number of the vectors in R that are not less than X.</p><p>After the concepts in B are ranked, the top 5 are selected as the most related concepts to A and C (see section 2.5.1 for how these top 5 selected related concepts are used for query expansion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Concept retrieval</head><p>Okapi relevance scoring formula <ref type="bibr" coords="3,449.08,176.82,15.70,8.22" target="#b12">[14]</ref> is known to embody a good model of relevance based upon term occurrences within text documents and the length of the documents. However, Okapi, in general, does not work well if the query contains multiple concepts. For example, one of the queries in the genomics track is asking for the role of gene "PRNP" in "Mad cow disease". Suppose that the concept "Mad cow disease" occurs several times within a document d 1 and the other concept "PRNP" is not mentioned in this document . In addition, d 1 is short in length (the number of words). Another document d 2 mentions both "Mad cow disease" and "PRNP". Suppose these two concepts occur once in d 2 and d 2 is long. In this case, Okapi is likely to rank d 1 higher than d 2 because of the bigger frequency of "Mad cow disease" and the fewer words in d 1 . However, d 2 is more likely to be a relevant document because it covers all the query concepts.</p><p>To fix this problem, we use concept retrieval model. Given a query q and a document d, two similarities are computed. One is their concept similarity ( , ) concept word sim q d sim q d sim q d = (3) A query q is associated with a vector v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="3,404.58,453.08,41.75,13.03">1 2 ( , ) v v v =</formula><p>where 1 v is a vector of all the concepts in q and 2 v is a vector of all the words in q:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="3,394.56,495.98,61.55,28.99">1 1 2 ( , ,..., ) i v c c c = 2 1 2</formula><p>( , ,..., )</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="3,317.76,511.91,155.28,63.38">j v w w w = ( , ) concept sim q d is computed as 1 ( , ) log concept c v N sim q d n ∈ = ∑ (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="3,473.04,557.52,3.66,8.22">)</formula><p>where N is the size of the document collection and n is the document frequency of the concept c.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Query expansion</head><p>A biomedical concept could have many different ways of saying it. As such, query expansion is critical for improving the performance of IR systems in the biomedical literature.

For different types of related concepts, we use different strategies to assign appropriate weights when they are added into the query, as described in the following: 1. Lexical variants of a gene name (either automatically generated or retrieved from the abbreviation database) are assigned the same weight as the original gene name. 2. Synonyms and hyponyms of a concept are assigned the same weight as the original concept. 3. Hypernyms of a concept are assigned partial weight of the original concept. The ratio α is set at 0.95. 4. For a selected X ∈ B with V(X) = [I(X,A) I(X,C)] (see section 2.3), if I(X,A) &gt; I(X,C), then X is assigned a partial weight of concept A, otherwise X is assigned a partial weight of concept C.

If the phrase concept is a gene name, such as "MMS 2", we require that "MMS" and "2" co-occur exactly adjacent to each other and "MMS" is on the left of "2". If the phrase concept is not a gene name, all the words in that phrase are required to co-occur within N = (n+(n-1)×2-1) word distance of the same sentence, where n is the number of words in the phrase concept. This window size will only allow at most two extra words in between two adjacent words in the phrase concept. For example, in the text "…human cells including those from colon, breast, and lung cancer …", the words in the concept "colon cancer" do not appear exactly adjacent to each other. But there are only 2 words in between them (word "and" is a stop word). As such, we say that the phrase concept "colon cancer" occurs in this document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Pesudo-feedback</head><p>Pseudo-feedback is a technique commonly used to improve retrieval performance assuming that the top-ranked documents are relevant, so that new terms are added into the original query. We used a modified pseudo-feedback strategy described in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,396.10,657.12,14.48,8.22" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>First, retrieve all the concepts from the top 15 ranked documents. For each of these 15 documents, it is first partitioned into sentences. For each sentence, the concepts are extracted in the same way the query concepts are extracted (see section 2.3.1) Second, for each concept c in the top ranked documents, compute the similarity sim(q,c) between the whole query q and the concept c. The computation of sim(q,c) can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,137.37,100.62,14.48,8.22" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Third, the top 5 ranked concepts (according to sim(q,c)) are selected.</p><p>Fourth, for each selected concept c', compute the global correlation between c' and each concept in query q using equation 1. Associate c' with the concept c q ∈ q that has the highest global correlation. If c' and c q have the same semantic type, add c' as one of alternatives of concept c q . A document having c' will receive a weight given by: 5 1 0.5 ( ) 5</p><formula xml:id="formula_17" coords="5,127.68,196.10,78.50,19.03">q i weight c -+ × ×</formula><p>, where i is the position of c' in the ranking of the second step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Avoid incorrect match of abbreviations</head><p>Some gene names are very short, such as gene "Pes". "Pes" could be the abbreviation for many non-gene longforms, such as "Pentaspan", "Phenol-extracted slime", or "primary empty sella". Given an abbreviation X with the long-form L, we scan the top k (k=1000) documents and when a document is found with X, we compare L with all the long-forms of X in that document. If none of these long-forms is equal to L, we cut the concept similarity of X from ( , ) concept sim q d . The program of extracting abbreviations and their long-forms from free-texts is downloaded from [17].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Step 3: Passage retrieval</head><p>This step takes the output of the step 2, the top 2,000 relevant paragraphs, and 1) identify the optimal passage within each paragraph; 2) rank the extracted optimal passages and output the top 1,000 most relevant passages; and finally 3) find the span of the passages in the original HTML full-text documents.</p><p>The criterion for the optimal passage in a paragraph is given by: "The part of the paragraph that has the fewest continuous sentences and covers the maximum number of distinct query concepts."</p><p>The ranking of passages is similar to the ranking of paragraphs. For each passage, we computed the term similarity and the concept similarity. The concept retrieval model described in section 2.4 is then applied for the ranking.</p><p>The final step is to link the passages to the source HTML full-text documents. For each passage, its maximum-length legal span given by the official file "legalspans.txt" (a file which includes all of the maximumlength legal spans for the collection) is examined and the actual span of that passage in the maximum-length legal span was identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiment results</head><p>We submitted 3 runs. In the first run, the top 1,000 most relevant paragraphs were returned as the passages. In the second run, the passage in a paragraph that has the fewest continuous sentences and covers the maximum number of query concepts is considered as the optimal passage. In the third run, the programs for identifying the optimal passages and finding the actual spans of each passage in the source documents were refined. The result is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,342.79,171.18,3.54,8.22" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. It is interesting to notice that our first run UICgen1 (simply return the whole paragraphs as the passages) achieved better performance than the other two on document level and aspect level. This is probably because a single document might contain multiple relevant passages. A series of new experiments were performed after the conference to examine how each type of domain-specific knowledge contributes to the retrieval performance. A baseline was established using the basic conceptual IR model without incorporating any type of domain-specific knowledge. Then five runs were conducted by adding each individual type of domain-specific knowledge. We also conducted a run by adding all types of domainspecific knowledge. Results of these experiments are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,376.23,583.98,3.54,8.22" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. We found that any available type of domain-specific knowledge improved the performance in passage retrieval. The biggest improvement comes from the lexical variants, which is consistent with the result reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,501.39,627.24,10.02,8.22" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This result also indicates that biologists are likely to use different variants of the same concept according to their own writing preferences and these variants might not be collected in the existing biomedical thesauruses. It also suggests that the biomedical IR systems can benefit from the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the literature by text mining systems. Synonyms provided the second biggest improvement. Hypernyms, hyponyms, and implicitly related concepts provided similar degrees of improvement. The overall performance is an accumulative result of adding different types of domain-specific knowledge and it is better than any individual addition. It is clearly shown that the performance is significantly improved (107% on passage level, 63.1% on aspect level, and 49.6% on document level) when the domain-specific knowledge is appropriately incorporated. Although it is not explicitly shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,100.71,322.74,3.54,8.22">4</ref>.2.3, different types of domain-specific knowledge affect different subsets of queries. More pacifically, each of these types (with the exception of "the lexical variants" which affects a large number of queries) affects only a few queries. But for those affected queries, their improvement is significant. As a consequence, the accumulative improvement is very significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future work</head><p>Five possible improvements will be investigated in the future research:</p><p>1. Term alignment. Term variation (i.e., expressing a single concept in a number of different ways), is very common in the biomedical literature. Our second improvement is to handle a certain type of term variation. For example, terms "ImmunoPrecipitation" (appear in 23,775 PubMed citations as of 08/23/2006), "Immune Precipitation" (404), "Immuno Precipitation" (177), and "Immu-nePrecipitation" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,141.82,528.72,15.74,8.22" target="#b10">(12)</ref> all refer to the same concept. The UMLS only includes "ImmunoPrecipitation" and "Immune Precipitation". These terms are slightly different morphologically. Fortunately, they all have the same abbreviation "IP".</p></div>

A homolog is a gene from one species, for example the mouse, that has a common origin and functions the same as a gene from another species, for example, humans, Drosophila, or yeast. [Source: NHBLI/NCBI Glossary]. In some cases, the role of a gene in a certain disease may be extensively studied in one of the gene's homologs, but not the gene itself. Retrieving those documents about the homolog could be very useful for the researcher to understand the function of the gene.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="3,391.50,642.41,1.97,3.44;3,465.96,626.85,2.72,4.75"><head>2 1</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
