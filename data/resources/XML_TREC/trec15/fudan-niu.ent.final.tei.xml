<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>People often turn to experts when they want to solve some problems. The behavior of expert search is labor costly and frustrating. Hence an automated system assisting knowledge and expertise management is strongly needed. The goal of Expert Search is to conduct experiment with enterprise data and offer a platform of evaluation for researchers. This is the first time we participate in Expert Search task. As a starter we refer to the experience of people finding experts in real life. Suppose that Brian is a software engineer facing a problem in his project, now he want to find someone with appropriate knowledge and skills to help him out. Generally there are two ways of searching experts: one is to search in social network, which is: ask someone for a possible recommendation and pass on. Brian should prudently choose the next person he asked, he may choose who most likely to know the potential expert. The other way is to search in the document repositories. In this case, Brian would prefer certain document types-technical reports, essays, presentations, which provide clear evidence of expertise. Both the two method is applicable. Hence our experiment this year models the two procedure of human activity, one model is a language model, the other is a social network model.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives our model and framework. Section 3 describes the technical details of our system. Section 4 presents our results. Section 5 is the conclusion of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>The scenario of expert search task is: given a list of candidate -1092 candidates in total, an enterprise corpora -the partial package of w3c web pages before 2004, and a list of topical queries -55 topics in the form of topic, description and narrative, the system should return a ranked list of experts in each query, and a ranked list of supporting documents for each experts.</p><p>Hence we see the key point of expert search task: How can we judge expertise? A possible solution is to look for relevant documents, and find candidates who have made some contribution to the documents. Based on language model theory, we have model 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,232.62,377.62,243.87,11.45">p(c | t) = Σp(c | d, t)p(d | t)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here p(c | t) defines the probability of candidate c being an expert of topic t, p(d | t) defines the probability of document d relevant to topic t, and p(c | d, t) defines the strength of candidate c associated to document d in topic t. The candidate-document score p(c | d, t) should quantitatively demonstrate the relation between the candidate and the document, e.g.: how much the document represent the candidate expertise, or how much is the candidate responsible to the document's context. To do so, we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,194.03,497.30,200.07,20.91">p(c | d, t) = 1 if c is the author of d tf (c|d)</formula><p>Σc(c|d) else From 2 we see that if a candidate c is the author or editor of document d, c is fully responsible to the context of d. Otherwise, we should consider the frequency of c in d and the total frequency of all experts in d.</p><p>Recall the procedure of Brian searching for experts, we notice that social factorsauthorities, collaborations, co-authorships can play an important part in judging experts. model 2 introduce those social factors to rank the candidates. We use email communications, citations and co-occurrence in documents to build an expertise network.</p><p>A Expertise Network is an edge-weighted, directed graph G(V, E, S, W ), where every vertex</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,117.83,656.90,358.65,26.05">v i ∈ V , each e ij ∈ E is an edge from v i to v j . w ij ∈ W is the weight of e ij , s i ∈ S is the score of v i</formula><p>In fact, every candidate has two scores, authority score and active score. The authority score s i shows the authority of candidate c i in social network, and active score c i shows the existing experience of candidate in documents. Generally, a candidate with more publications is more active, a candidate work with more experts is more authoritative.</p><p>In the submitted runs, we use language model's result to initialize social network model. That is, we assign the relevant score in language model as active score in social network, document relevancy in language model as the strength of communication panel in social network. And finally we re-rank the candidates by their authority score.</p><p>Therefore we give the algorithms</p><p>• step 1:pre-process choose specific types of document: technical reports, essays, etc.</p><p>• Step 2:candidate recognition identify the candidates in documents, assign each document-candidate pair an association score.</p><p>• Step 3:document retrieval use lemur to retrieve relevant document in corpora, assign each document a relevant score.</p><p>• Step 4:expert ranking rank experts by the product of document score and document-candidate score.</p><p>• Step 5:social network use social network to re-rank experts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Framework</head><p>Our system consists of three parts, candidate recognition, pre-processing and expert ranking modules. In expert ranking module, we use the two models we described above to measure expertise for each candidate. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,392.71,471.92,5.45,11.45">1</ref> shows the framework of our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Candidate Recognition</head><p>In expert search task, we are given a list of candidates including candidates The purpose of candidate recognition is to identify the candidate's occurrence and compute the weight of candidate-document pair p(c | d, t).</p><p>TREC provides us a candidate list including each candidate's full name and official email address. However, this is not enough. A candidate can appear in a document in 4 forms.</p><p>• case 1: exact match the candidate's full name appears in the document exactly as it is.</p><p>• case 2: last name matchonly the candidate's last name appears in the document. Abbreviation or nickname is used to replace the original first name.</p><p>• case 3: email matchonly the candidate's email address appears in the document. The email address may not be the official one in the candidate list. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,266.56,436.48,4.24,11.45">1</ref>: system framework A candidate could appear as an author, an editor, a reviewer, or a reference. As described above, we distinguish the author and editor of a document. We approach it in a rule-based manner. We implement the candidate recognition procedure in the following 4 steps:</p><p>• step 0 start from the candidate list, for each candidate, we have tuple &lt; c i d, c f ullname, email 1 &gt;</p><p>• step 1 exactly match the full name of candidates. For each document, we have tuple &lt; d, c 1 , c 2 , , , c n &gt;.</p><p>• step 2 employs a nickname dictionary to match the nicknames and abbreviations, if the candidate's last name appears. After the step, we got tuple &lt; c i d, c f ullname, c n ickname, c a bbname &gt;.For each document, we update tuple &lt; d, c 1 , c 2 , , , c n &gt;.</p><p>• step 3we go through the w3c email archives, if a candidate c i appears in tuple Table <ref type="table" coords="5,279.57,233.95,4.24,11.45">1</ref>: w3c corpus</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,145.10,676.11,53.73,12.50">&lt; d j , c 1 , c 2 ,</formula><p>• step 5mark the position of each occurrence of candidate, a 10-word window of context before the position is extracted to form a feature vector &lt; f 1 , f 2 , , , f 10 &gt;of document-candidate pair &lt; d j , c i &gt;.If feature f i is "author", "editor" or other keywords we predefined, the c i is the author or editor of document d j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Pre-processing</head><p>In our model, we assume that some document types explicitly manifest the candidate's expertise , which are: technical reports, presentations(slides) and w3c working drafts. Since the w3c web site is organized hierarchically, publications are congregated and can be easily found. Text classification methods are also used here to identify the specific document types.</p><p>• Step 1:URL analysis we assign documents with url prefix "www.w3.org/TR/" as positive samples.</p><p>• Step 2: feature selection the context between html head tag (¡h1¿,¡h2¿...¡h6¿) are extracted as features of the document.</p><p>• Step 3: text classification use svm to classify all the documents in www pages. The svm is trained by positive samples gained by step 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Document Retrieval</head><p>The w3c corpus consists of 6 parts. In our system, the email archives and web pages are treated differently. Emails are not formal texts, for better understanding, we should analyze email's characters. We clean their quotes, combine all the context in one thread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Result</head><p>We submit 3 runs: FDUSF , FDUSO, FDUSN. As our result shows, the performance of submitted runs differ in topics. However FDUSO and FDUSNhas a higher overall precision and map than FDUSF, which suggest the affect of different document type in judging expertise. In several particular topics, our system achieved lower score than median results. We believe that query expansion will improve our performance in these topics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>From the result we can conclude that: both language model and social network model yield good precision. The main contribution of our system is exploring the potential of combining social network and standard IR methods. However, in our submitted runs, the ranking algorithm of social network model is noisy and depends too much on the result of text retrieval model. Our future work remain on mining the structure and latent semantic of expertise network.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,200.64,676.11,14.43,11.45;4,215.06,680.24,5.14,8.37;4,224.24,676.11,47.44,11.45;4,271.68,680.24,2.89,8.37;4,278.07,676.11,35.34,11.45;4,313.41,680.24,3.43,8.37;4,320.80,676.11,155.67,11.45;4,145.10,689.66,66.69,11.45;4,211.79,693.79,2.89,8.37;4,215.17,689.66,15.24,11.45;4,230.42,693.93,4.06,8.37;4,235.87,689.66,49.71,11.45;4,285.59,693.79,5.14,8.37;4,291.23,689.66,51.06,11.45;4,342.27,693.79,4.50,8.37;4,347.27,689.66,68.63,11.45;4,415.89,693.79,4.23,8.37;4,420.62,689.66,32.29,11.45;4,452.91,693.79,4.23,8.37;4,457.64,689.66,42.00,11.45;4,499.62,693.79,5.14,8.37;4,508.29,689.66,8.49,11.45;4,134.19,711.10,229.16,11.45;4,363.36,715.23,4.23,8.37;4,368.09,711.10,9.57,11.45;4,377.66,715.23,4.23,8.37;4,382.39,711.10,19.26,11.45;4,401.66,715.23,5.14,8.37;4,410.33,711.10,58.47,11.45;5,222.69,127.40,12.12,11.45;5,339.19,127.40,18.79,11.45;5,189.05,141.35,79.40,11.45;5,321.68,141.35,53.80,11.45;5,186.03,155.30,85.44,11.45;5,322.98,155.30,51.20,11.45;5,190.11,169.25,77.30,11.45;5,286.15,169.25,124.84,11.45;5,189.36,183.20,78.77,11.45;5,328.03,183.20,41.09,11.45;5,183.30,197.14,90.89,11.45;5,314.72,197.14,67.72,11.45;5,186.75,211.09,84.02,11.45;5,335.25,211.09,26.66,11.45"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, , c n &gt;, and if c i writes d j from a different address, we update the tuple as &lt; c i d, c f ullname, c n ickname, c a bbname, email 1 , email 2 , , , email n &gt; • step 4repeat step 3 and step 4 until no tuple &lt; d, c 1 , c 2 , , , c n &gt; is updated. url type lists-***-******* mail archive www-***-******* www pages dev-***-******* development archives, codes esw-***-******* esw, wiki people-***-******* people archives other-***-******* others</figDesc></figure>
