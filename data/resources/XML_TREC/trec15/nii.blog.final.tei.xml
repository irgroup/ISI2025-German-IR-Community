<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ranking blog posts that express opinions regarding a given topic should serve a critical function in helping users. We explored three types of opinion retrieval methods in the framework of probabilistic language models. The first method combines topic-relevance model and opinion-relevance model that captures topic dependence of the opinion expressions. The second method makes use of probability that any of opinion-bearing words appear in each target document as document prior probability in query-likelihood model. The third method makes use of probability that any of adjectives or adverbs appear in each target document as document prior probability, assuming opinionated documents tend to contain more adjectives or adverbs than other documents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The recent rapid expansion of access to information has significantly increased the demands on retrieval or classification of sentiment information from a large amount of textual data. The field of sentiment classification has recently received considerable attention, where the polarities of sentiment, such as positive or negative, were identified from unstructured text <ref type="bibr" coords="1,120.04,654.28,16.73,9.82" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,93.13,681.38,11.82,9.82" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,107.59,681.38,7.88,9.82" target="#b1">2]</ref>, and at sentence level, e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,238.49,681.38,11.82,9.82" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,252.95,681.38,8.18,9.82" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,263.78,681.38,8.08,9.82" target="#b7">8]</ref>; how-ever, the accuracy is still less than desirable. Therefore, ranking according to the likelihood of containing sentiment information is expected to serve a crucial function in helping users.</p><p>For this objective, Eguchi and Lavrenko <ref type="bibr" coords="1,504.78,325.33,12.72,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref> proposed sentiment retrieval models, aiming at finding sentences containing information with a specific sentiment polarity on a certain topic, where the topic dependence of the sentiment was considered. Intuitively, the expression of sentiment in text is dependent on the topic. Sentiment polarities are also dependent on topics or domains. A couple of examples follow. A negative view for some voting event may be expressed using 'flaw', while a negative view for some politician may be expressed using 'reckless'. As another example, the adjective 'unpredictable' may have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as 'unpredictable steering', but it could have a positive orientation in a movie review, in a phrase such as 'unpredictable plot', as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.53,542.12,18.18,9.82" target="#b11">[12]</ref> in the context of his sentiment word detection. Eguchi and Lavrenko's sentiment retrieval models can address both cases based on the framework of generative language modeling, not only assuming query terms expressing a certain topic, but also assuming that the sentiment polarity of interest is specified by the user in some manner.</p><p>For the TREC 2006 Blog Track, we first followed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,310.61,654.28,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but we set aside the topic dependence of the sentiment polarities and focused on that of the sentiment expressions since the evaluation criteria of the Blog Track did not distinguish the sentiment polarities. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.00,110.61,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, sentence level was focused in the experiments; however, the model can be applied to textual chunks of any length. We also explored the use of some document features as document prior probabilities in query-likelihood model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.37,164.80,16.73,9.82" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A Generative Model of Opinion 2.1 Definitions</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.13,247.91,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we start by providing a set of definitions that will be used in the remainder of this section. The task of our model is to generate a collection of statements w 1 . . .w n . A statement w i is a string of words w i1 . . .w in i , drawn from a common vocabulary V. We introduce a binary variable b ij ∈{S, T } as an indicator of whether the word in the jth position of the ith statement will be a topic word or an opinion-bearing word. For our purposes, b ij is determined heuristically (automatic annotation), in this paper.</p><p>As a matter of convenience we will often denote a statement as a pair {w s i , w t i }, where w s i contains the opinion-bearing words and w t i contains the topic words. As we mentioned above, the user's query is treated as just another statement. It will be denoted as a pair {q s , q t }, corresponding to opinion-bearing words and topic keywords. We will use p to denote a unigram language model, i.e., a function that assigns a number p(v)∈[0, 1] to every word v in our vocabulary V, such that Σ v p(v)=1. The set of all possible unigram language models is the probability simplex IP . We define π : IP ×IP →[0, 1] to be a measure function that assigns a probability π(p 1 , p 2 ) to a pair of language models p 1 and p 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Generative model</head><p>Using the definitions presented above, and assuming that π() is given, we hypothesize that a new statement w i containing words w i1 . . .w im can be generated according to the following mechanism.</p><p>1. Draw p t and p s from π(•, •).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">For each position</head><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,338.25,95.23,157.46,37.53">j = 1. . .m: (a) if b ij =T : draw w ij from p t (•) ; (b) if b ij =S: draw w ij from p s (•) .</formula><p>The probability of observing the new statement w i1 . . .w im under this mechanism is given by: pt,ps</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,353.48,168.94,185.77,33.24">π(p t , p s ) m j=1 p t (w ij ) if b ij =T p s (w ij ) otherwise<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We use this simple equation instead of that in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,526.61,210.89,12.72,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref> since we can set aside sentiment polarities in this paper. The summation in equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,467.90,237.99,4.24,9.82" target="#formula_1">1</ref>) goes over all possible pairs of language models p t , p s , but we can avoid integration by specifying a mass function π() that assigns nonzero probabilities to a finite subset of points in IP ×IP . We accomplish this by using a nonparametric estimate for π(), the details of which are provided below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Using the model for retrieval</head><p>The generative model presented above can be applied to opinion retrieval in the following fashion. Following <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.64,396.51,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we start with a collection of statements C and a query {q s , q t } supplied by the user, where q s can be some typical opinion-bearing words with either positive or negative polarity and q s can be words in the title field in the topic given by the Blog Track organizers. We use the procedure outlined in Section 2.2 to estimate the topic-and opinionrelevance models corresponding to the user's information need, and then determine which statements in our collection most closely correspond to these models of relevance. The topic-relevance model R t and opinion-relevance model R s are estimated in the similar fashion described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.86,559.10,12.72,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for each query {q s , q t }. Once we have estimates for the topic and sentiment relevance models, we can rank testing statements w by their similarity to R t and R s . We rank statements using a variation of cross-entropy, which was proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,417.33,626.85,18.18,9.82" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and modified for sentiment retrieval task in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,405.22,640.40,11.82,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,313.64,658.90,222.58,22.09">α v R t (v) log p t (v)+(1-α) v R s (v) log p s (v).</formula><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,530.77,681.38,8.48,9.82">)<label>2</label></formula><p>Here the summations extend over all words v in the vocabulary. A weighting parameter α allows us to change the balance of topic and sentiment in the final ranking formula; its value can be selected empirically.</p><p>3 Opinion Retrieval Task</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Using opinion-relevance models</head><p>We define a variation of the sentiment retrieval model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,102.43,256.62,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As input, we used (1) a set of topic keywords q t and (2) a set of opinion-bearing seed words q s . Since we did not have a training data set, all the model parameters were the same as used in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,285.27,297.27,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These model parameters are not very appropriate for the opinion retrieval experiments in the Blog Track, as we describe later in this paper. We detected opinion-bearing words using lists of words. We used sentiment word list contained in OpinionFinder <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.59,379.63,11.59,9.82" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which consists of 2230 positive and 3913 negative words. We extracted opinionbearing expressions using the list of words above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Other models</head><p>NII1: As a baseline, we carried out experiments using Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="3,142.76,478.46,11.59,9.82" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Entire corpus with blog documents was indexed. The topics were used as queries top 1000 documents were retrieved using query likelihood approach on the Indri platform.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NII7:</head><p>As another baseline, we used (topic-) relevance model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.38,566.37,11.59,9.82" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which was estimated using the (weighted) mixture of each model of a certain number of top-ranked documents. We used the result of the baseline run of NII1, and re-ranked them using the topic-relevance model. NII6: This is the retrieval model as described in Section 2.3. We used the result of the baseline run of NII1, and re-ranked them using this retrieval model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NII5:</head><p>We obtained a list of opinion-bearing words and used it to find out the document prior probability in the language modeling framework. This probability was calculated by finding the total number of opinion-bearing words in a document and dividing it by the total number of words in that document. This probability was multiplied by the query likelihood probability. The query likelihood probability was obtained from the baseline run of NII1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NII3:</head><p>We made use of probability that any of adjectives or adverbs appear in each target document as document prior probability in addition to the query-likelihood model on the Indri platform, assuming opinionated documents tend to contain more adjectives or adverbs than other documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and Discussions</head><p>According to the relevance judgment results, NII5 and NII3 did not work, unfortunately. A more detailed investigation on these models is in progress, though. As for NII7 and NII6, we used the model parameters estimated in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,424.29,559.43,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where sentence-level retrieval experiments were performed, because we could not use training data to estimate the model parameters at document level of blogs. This setting was not appropriate for blog-post retrieval, and so the performance of NII7 and NII6 was not as good as that of NII1. We are currently investigating on all potential causes of the performance problems, such as model parameters and indexing conditions. Using the relevance judgment data given by the organizers, we are planning to estimate the model parameters appropriately for the task defined in the TREC Blog Track, and to perform the additional experiments to investigate how the topic-sentiment relevance model actually works at the appropriate setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,311.76,103.51,226.42,91.20"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Mean average precision of our official runs</figDesc><table coords="3,325.67,116.74,198.55,77.97"><row><cell cols="3">RunID opinion-relevance topic-relevance</cell></row><row><cell>NII1</cell><cell>0.0466</cell><cell>0.0834</cell></row><row><cell>NII7</cell><cell>0.0383</cell><cell>0.0736</cell></row><row><cell>NII6</cell><cell>0.0324</cell><cell>0.0645</cell></row><row><cell>NII5</cell><cell>0.0195</cell><cell>0.0475</cell></row><row><cell>NII3</cell><cell>0.0168</cell><cell>0.0419</cell></row></table></figure>
