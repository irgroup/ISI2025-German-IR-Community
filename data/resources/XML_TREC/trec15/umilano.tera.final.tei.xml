<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>MG4J is a Java indexing system that we have been developing in the last four years with the initial purpose of supporting searches over the crawls performed by UbiCrawler <ref type="bibr" coords="1,448.54,399.81,11.59,9.46" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Initially a loosely coupled set of classes supporting standard text-indexing techniques inspired by MG <ref type="bibr" coords="1,163.08,426.91,16.72,9.46" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, it has evolved into a quite complex system implementing a large class of scalable algorithms that are of interest to the text-retrieval community. Because of its flexibility, it has been used, for instance, in IR research to study problems of document reordering <ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.47,454.01,12.72,9.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and for building databases of protein names from textual documents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,378.55,467.56,11.59,9.46" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>After the first implementation phase, MG4J has been used as a playground for research ideas in text retrieval, with a special focus on efficiency even with large corpora. In particular, we developed a new skipping system <ref type="bibr" coords="1,247.00,508.20,12.72,9.46" target="#b3">[4]</ref> based on the embedding of compressed perfect skip lists, and we extended the classical Clarke-Cormack-Burkowski <ref type="bibr" coords="1,368.47,521.75,12.72,9.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref> lattice for structured queries to support multiple indices and negation. We are also developing new scorers based on that extension, that incorporate novel ideas about multi-index semantics.</p><p>In MG4J the emphasis is always on linear algorithms. We are interested in indexing systems that can scale easily to the web size and that can be used under heavy concurrent access with a very low response time. These requirements limit the range of techniques that can be used, but it is at the same time a great stimulus for finding more efficient algorithms and implementations.</p><p>MG4J is free software distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and can be downloaded from http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/.</p><p>This year we developed an ad hoc document factory (see the MG4J documentation) for TREC. This made it possible to index easily all or part of the GOV2 collection. The factory is in turn based on a document collection that exposes a set of (possibly gzip'd) files as a set of segments (the contents of the header and of the body part of a TREC GOV2 document). We did not develop support for WebGraph <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.87,184.33,11.59,9.46" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, as for this year we decided to drop PageRank from the scorers. The reasons are several; first of all, the experience gathered the last year shows (as expected) that GOV2 is too small (and heavily biased) to show a significant advantage of PageRank w.r.t. more trivial link-based schemes (e.g., indegree count or weighted indegree count); second, GOV2 contains a large number of duplicate (even triplicate) URIs, and even a larger number of URIs that are duplicate after trivial normalisation procedures. Since our index construction process is based on the idea of unique, normalised URIs, ranking GOV2 cleanly would have required a massive effort (the last year, we simply dropped all duplicate URIs, which however affected recall). For anchor text, we made duplicate URIs into unique URIs by adding greedily random noise to each URI that appeared to be a duplicate.</p><p>An advantage of the GOV2 collection is that, as biased as it is, it is mainly monolingual, which made it possible to index it safely after downcasing and Porter stemming. Some experiments showed that, indeed, this choice improved recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Querying</head><p>MG4J makes it possible to combine several indices over the same document collection. In our case, the indices were made of the title of a page, its text and the text of the anchors pointing to the page. Queries can use classical Boolean-like operators (and, or, not), operators that are specific to minimal-interval semantics (consecutivity, low-pass, ordered-and) and operators for multi-index querying (index specifiers, multiplexers). Additionally, MG4J provides an "and then" operator that computes the results for a query and then appends new results from additional queries.</p><p>The "and then" operator has been used in the ad hoc manual runs to mimic the behaviour of a search engine user who starts with a very stringent query and then relaxes it when too few documents are returned. It has also been used in the automatic runs, as queries were generated by taking the words in the title, dropping stopwords, and generating a chain of queries containing the conjunction of all title terms, "and then" the disjunction of all possible conjunctions of all title terms but one, and so on, up to the disjunction of all terms; more precisely, if you let W denote the set of non-stopword terms appearing in the title, the automatic query submitted to the system was</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,264.00,610.63,82.25,35.92">|W |-1 k=0 S∈( W |W |-k ) t∈S t,</formula><p>where denotes the "and then" operator, and W k denotes the set of all subsets of W of cardinality k. Even though the size of automatic queries grows exponentially in |W |, the system keeps responding within reasonable time since every operator (except, of course, ) is implemented in an inherently lazy manner <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.00,118.84,11.59,9.46" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The scoring of our runs is obtained by combining linearly a BM25 standard scorer and the proximity-based scorer used at TREC 2005 (implemented by the class VignaScorer of MG4J). Depending on the last letters of the run, the weight of each scorer was 1 or 2 (for instance, in BVV runs the proximity-based scorer has twice the importance of the BM25 scorer). The weighting is purely tentative-clearly, a more sophisticated weight-decision procedure based on previous years' results would provide a more solid choice. For details on the algorithms used by proximity-based scorer, see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,286.99,213.69,11.59,9.46" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>We implemented BM25 scoring using the formula reported by Robertson, Zaragoza and Taylor in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.60,240.79,11.59,9.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, using the weights proposed therein (k 1 = .75, b = .95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>For the first year we submitted both automatic and manual runs. As explained in the previous section, automatic runs were generated using a very simple term-subset expansion.</p><p>After submitting our results, we detected some bugs and configuration mistakes: here we report results obtained after our fixes (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,307.88,341.39,3.94,9.46">1</ref>).</p><p>• First of all, we discovered too late that Büttcher and Clarke <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.56,366.89,12.72,9.46" target="#b5">[6]</ref> reported different values for BM25 parameters (k 1 = 1.2 and b = .5, for essentially the same formula), suggested by feedback on the data from previous TREC runs. The value they suggest offer a significant improvement over the ones we used.</p><p>• Due to a mistake in term processing, numbers were not present in the index used to run our queries. As a result, the 1890 census manual queries could not be properly written, and the automatic ones ended up in just searching for "census". We patched the query in the manual runs using the same expansion used for automatic runs on the term sequence "1890 US census".</p><p>• In automatic runs, we performed stopword elimination from the titles manually. We missed some prepositions in large queries, resulting (by expansion) in a preposterous answer time of about 10 minutes, which affected significantly the average time.</p></div>

The value for B (pure BM25) was not submitted and it is shown here as a baseline.
