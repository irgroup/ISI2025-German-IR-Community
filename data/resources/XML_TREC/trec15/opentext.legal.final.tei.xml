<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We analyze the results of several experimental runs submitted to the Legal Discovery and Terabyte Tracks of TREC 2006. In the Legal Track, the final negotiated boolean queries produced higher mean scores in average precision and Precision@10 than a corresponding vector run of the same query terms, but the vector run usually recalled more relevant items by rank 5000, and on average the boolean query matched less than half of the relevant items. We also report the impact of query negotiation, metadata and natural language vs. keywords. We find that robust metrics (which expose the downside of blind feedback techniques) are inappropriate for legal discovery because they favour duplicate filtering. We also report the results of depth probe experiments (depth 9000 in the Legal Track and depth 5000 in the Terabyte Track) which provide a lower-bound estimate for the number of unjudged relevant items in each track. 1 Livelink, Open Text TM and SearchServer TM are trademarks or registered trademarks of Open Text Corporation in the United States of America, Canada, the European Union and/or other countries.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Livelink ECM -eDOCS SearchServer TM (formerly known as Hummingbird SearchServer TM ) is a toolkit for developing enterprise search and retrieval applications. The SearchServer kernel is also embedded in other components of the Livelink ECM -eDOCS Suite 1 .</p><p>SearchServer works in Unicode internally <ref type="bibr" coords="1,269.94,480.15,10.52,10.46" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and supports most of the world's major character sets and languages. The major conferences in text retrieval experimentation (TREC <ref type="bibr" coords="1,404.56,492.10,14.61,10.46" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, CLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="1,456.23,492.10,10.52,10.46" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and NTCIR <ref type="bibr" coords="1,525.61,492.10,10.79,10.46" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) have provided judged test collections for objective experimentation with SearchServer in more than a dozen languages.</p><p>This paper describes experimental work with SearchServer (experimental post-6.0 builds) for legal discovery and terabyte retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Legal Discovery Track</head><p>The Legal Discovery Track (also known as the TREC Legal Track) was new to TREC this year. The collection to be searched was the IIT Complex Document Information Processing (IIT CDIP) test collection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.17,600.67,9.96,10.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It contained 6,910,192 metadata records from US tobacco companies; 6,794,895 of the records included document text of varying quality from an optical character reader. Uncompressed, the collection was 61,251,357,065 bytes (57.0 GB). The average record size (including metadata markup and the ocr document) was 8864 bytes.</p><p>In legal discovery, the goal (indeed, legal obligation) is to return all documents responsive (relevant) to a production request. For TREC, the organizers created 46 new production requests (topics), numbered from 6 to 51. Each topic included a "request text" (a natural language description of the request, typically onesentence), a "defendant query" (an initial boolean query proposed by the defendant), and a "final negotiated query" (a rejoinder boolean query from the plaintiff, which was used as the final query of the negotiations). (Examples appear in the topic analysis below.) During the assessing phase, 7 topics were dropped, leaving 39 topics. For these, 111 records were judged relevant per topic (low 1, high 502, median 63).</p><p>[19] has more details on the track and task, and <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.43,157.18,10.52,10.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has more background on legal discovery in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Indexing</head><p>We indexed the collection twice, once including the full record (metadata plus ocr document), and a second time just indexing the ocr documents. For the full record case, we indexed from the "&lt;/tid&gt;" tag to the "&lt;/record&gt;" tag, which meant both the metadata and the ocr document were in the FT TEXT column.</p><p>For the ocr-only case, we indexed from after the "&lt;ot&gt;" tag to the "&lt;/record&gt;" tag, hence just the ocr document was in the FT TEXT column. Any tags themselves were indexed (we just didn't bother to discard them). Entities (e.g. "&amp;amp;") were converted to the character they represented (e.g. "&amp;").</p><p>For the full record index, we did not use a stopword list, and we also indexed most punctuation as 1character words (exceptions were the hyphen and apostrophe, which were treated as 1-character stopwords). The contents of the "&lt;dd&gt;" section of the metadata were additionally indexed in a separate DOCDATE column.</p><p>For the ocr-only index, we used an English stopword list (e.g. "the", "of", "by") and punctuation was not indexed.</p><p>Both indexes just included the surface forms of the words (no stemming). The documents were assumed to be in the Windows-1252 character set when converted to Unicode. Words were normalized to upper-case and any accents were dropped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Searching</head><p>The techniques used for the 8 submitted runs of July 2006 (and 2 later re-runs) are described below. The relevance ranking approach was the same for all runs. The relevance function dampened the term frequency and adjusted for document length in a manner similar to Okapi <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.63,446.04,15.50,10.46" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and dampened the inverse document frequency using an approximation of the logarithm. For wildcard terms (e.g. "televis!"), all variants (e.g. "television", "televised", "televisions", etc.) were treated as occurrences of the same term for term frequency purposes, and inverse document frequency was based on the most common variant. For terms in phrases or proximity contraints of boolean queries, only occurrences of the term satisfying the phrase or proximity counted towards term frequency.</p><p>The 8 submitted runs (and 2 re-runs) were as follows: humL06t (main boolean run): The submitted humL06t run used the final negotiated query, respecting the boolean operators such as AND, phrase, proximity, NOT, etc. Full wildcard matching was supported. Relevance-ranking was still used to order the matching rows. The run was labelled as manual because some hand-editing was done to convert the queries to the SearchSQL syntax of SearchServer, but the run was automatic in spirit because it just implemented the final boolean query intended by the negotiators. For example, for topic 45, for which the final negotiated query was "(research OR stud! OR "in vivo") AND pigeon AND (death! OR dead OR die! OR dying)", the corresponding SearchSQL statement was humL06t' (updated main boolean run (not submitted)): The humL06t' run was the same as humL06t except that an updated development build was used which fixed a proximity-matching bug that affected 7 of the queries. Fortunately, there was little impact on the overall results (more details are in Section 2.3.8). humL06t0 (defendant boolean run): The submitted humL06t0 run was the same as humL06t except that the defendant query was used instead of the final negotiated boolean query. For example, for topic 45, for which the initial query proposed by the defendant was ""animal studies" AND "pigeon deaths"", the WHERE clause of the corresponding SearchSQL statement was WHERE (FT_TEXT CONTAINS 'animal studies' AND FT_TEXT CONTAINS 'pigeon deaths') humL06t0' (updated defendant boolean run (not submitted)): The humL06t0' run was the same as humL06t0 except that the updated development build was used (more details are in Section 2.3.8).</p><p>humL06tv (main vector run): The submitted humL06tv run was the same as humL06t except that the boolean operators such as AND, phrases and proximities were dropped (all operators became an OR), and punctuation was dropped. Full wildcarding was still respected. For example, for topic 45, the WHERE clause of the corresponding SearchSQL statement was</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,82.46,282.71,298.13,22.41">WHERE ((FT_TEXT CONTAINS 'research'|'stud%'|'in'|'vivo'| 'pigeon'|'death%'|'dead'|'die%'|'dying'))</formula><p>humL06tvo (main ocr-only run): The submitted humL06tvo run was the same as humL06tv except that the ocr-only index was used instead of the full-record index (i.e. the FROM clause of the SearchSQL statement referred to the LEGAL06OCR table instead of LEGAL06FULL).</p><p>humL06dvo (main natural language run): The submitted humL06dvo run was the same as humL06tvo except that the terms were taken from the request text instead of the final negotiated query. Terms in our list of common instruction words (e.g. "find", "relevant", "document") were discarded (using the same list we used in past years for the Description field of an ad hoc topic). For example, for topic 45, for which the request text was "All documents that refer or relate to pigeon deaths during the course of animal studies. humL06tve (blind feedback run): The submitted humL06tve run was a blind feedback run based 50% on humL06tv and 25% each on expansion queries from the first 2 rows of humL06tv. humL06tvc (duplicate filtering run): The submitted humL06tvc run was the same as humL06tv except that rows which appeared to be duplicates of a previous row were discarded. The heuristic filtering approach was to discard a row if all of the passages surrounding matching terms were identical to the set of such passages of any previous row.</p><p>humL06tvz (depth probe run): The first 90 rows of the submitted humL06tvz run were a one percent subset of the first 9000 rows of humL06tv (rows 1, 101, 201, 301, ..., 8901), and its remaining 1000 rows were rows 9001-10000 of humL06tv. (This run was based on the same approach as the humT06xlz run submitted a month earlier for the Terabyte track, described in a later section.)</p><p>For each run, only 5000 rows were allowed to be submitted for each query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Results</head><p>Tables 1-3 list several mean scores for the 8 submitted runs (and 2 re-runs in parentheses). The retrieval measures are defined in Section 4.1 of the Glossary at the end of the paper. The highest mean scores of each measure are in bold; however, see Tables 4-10 for which mean differences are statistically significant. (The columns of Tables 4-10 are explained in Section 4.2 of the Glossary.)  <ref type="table" coords="4,114.61,400.87,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that the main vector run had a higher recall by depth 5000 (R@5000 measure) than the corresponding main boolean run, which is unsurprising because the vector run would usually match all of the same rows as the boolean run, and more.</p><p>However, if there was a penalty for retrieving non-relevant items before the relevant items, e.g. if precision was a factor in the measure, then the main boolean run typically had the higher mean score. In particular, the main boolean run had the highest mean average precision (MAP) of the listed runs of Table <ref type="table" coords="4,494.46,460.64,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. MAP is a measure which requires both perfect recall and precision to get a 1.0 score.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,118.84,484.55,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,147.66,484.55,4.98,10.46">3</ref> include measures based on the boolean set size. In particular, Recall@B was less than 50% for the main boolean run, i.e. the boolean query did not match more than 50% of the (judged) relevant items (on average).</p><p>Note that only the first 10 rows submitted for each query were guaranteed to be in the assessing pool (and a few of those still were not assessed). Table <ref type="table" coords="4,294.80,532.37,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> includes its measures after discarding unjudged items, and the results were similar (e.g. MAPJ gave almost the same ranking as MAP). Still, the inconsistency in the number of judged items in the boolean sets for different runs (J@B column of Table <ref type="table" coords="4,458.03,556.29,4.43,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) is disconcerting.</p><p>The next 7 sections look at the differences between the submitted runs in more detail, followed by an additional section on the updated boolean runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Defendant Boolean vs. Main Boolean</head><p>The main boolean query (the rejoinder by the plaintiff) was apparently successful at finding more relevant items than the initial boolean query proposed by the defendant. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,381.62,636.43,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_4">6</ref> shows that the main boolean run's Recall@5000 (R@5000) was higher for 35 of the 39 topics and tied for the other 4, with no declines (as per the "t-t0" row for R@5000 of Table <ref type="table" coords="4,225.88,660.35,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_4">6</ref>). We look at topic 45, for which  show that the main boolean run was superior on several metrics, and topic 14, for which the defendant boolean run had a much higher Precision@10 (though still lower recall): • Topic 45 ("pigeon deaths during the course of animal studies"): The defendant boolean query ("animal studies" AND "pigeon deaths") required both the phrases "animal studies" and "pigeon deaths" to be in the record, which matched no records, and hence all of the relevant items were missed. The main boolean query ((research OR stud! OR "in vivo") AND pigeon AND (death! OR dead OR die! OR dying)) was more lenient, matching 2894 records, of which 387 were judged and 122 of those were judged relevant (although 35 other relevant records were not matched).</p><p>• Topic 14 ("marketing, placement, or sale of lozenges to children"): The defendant boolean query ((marketing OR placement OR sale) AND "lozenges" AND "children") required the term "marketing" or "placement" or "sale" to be in the record, which led to high precision in the first 10 items (P10 of 0.9). The main boolean query (lozenges AND (child! OR teen! OR juvenile! OR kid! OR adolescent)) dropped the "marketing" requirement, which matched all the same documents and more (657 vs. 284) and found a couple more relevant items (19 instead of 17), but precision was lower (e.g. P10 was 0.0). The main boolean query still missed 17 of the 36 relevant items.</p><p>Overall, in the negotiations, it appears that the defendant typically proposed a high-precision query, and the plaintiff's rejoinder was to modify it so that it would match the same rows and more (higher recall), though sometimes at the expense of precision. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Main Boolean vs. Main Vector</head><p>The main vector run used the same query terms as the main boolean run, but all boolean operators such as AND, phrases and proximities were dropped (all operators became an OR), and punctuation was dropped. Full wildcarding was still respected. The vector run always matched at least 5000 rows (the limit to submit). Topics strongly favoring the boolean run (in at least one metric):</p><p>• Topic 45 ("pigeon deaths during the course of animal studies"):</p><p>This topic had the biggest difference in P10 in favour of the boolean run (as per the "t-tv" entry for ∆P10 of Table <ref type="table" coords="7,181.29,619.45,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).</p><p>The main boolean query ((research OR stud! OR "in vivo") AND pigeon AND (death! OR dead OR die! OR dying)) required the term "pigeon" to be in the record, which was good for precision (e.g. P10 of 1.0).</p><p>In the main vector query ('research'|'stud%'|'in'|'vivo'|'pigeon'|'death%'|'dead'|'die%'|'dying'), the synonyms for "death" dominated the query, and many high-ranking matches did not mention pigeons, hurting precision (e.g. P10 of 0.2). At 5000 items retrieved (268 judged), the vector run had found 90 of the  • Topic 17 ("donations or contributions to the Libertarian Party"): This topic had the biggest difference in R@B, MAP, GMAP', bpref, R-Prec and GS10J in favour of the boolean run (as per the "t-tv" entries of Tables <ref type="table" coords="9,336.76,472.60,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_2">4</ref><ref type="table" coords="9,340.75,472.60,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_3">5</ref><ref type="table" coords="9,340.75,472.60,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_4">6</ref><ref type="table" coords="9,344.73,472.60,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_5">7</ref>). The main boolean query (((donat! OR contrib!) AND libertarian) BUT NOT (democrat! OR republic! OR GOP OR "G.O.P." OR "Grand Old Party")), which excluded any records with words such as "Democratic", "Republican" or "GOP", matched 267 records (212 judged), finding 3 of the 4 relevant items (and the 3 relevant items were the first 3 items returned).</p><p>The main vector query</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="9,96.91,532.37,443.23,22.41">('donat%'|'contrib%'|'libertarian'|'democrat%'|'republic%'|'GOP'|'G'|'O'|'P'|'Grand'| 'Old'|'Party'</formula><p>) dropped the NOT operator, which hurt precision (the first relevant item was returned at rank 2478), though all 4 relevant items were returned in the first 5000 items (280 judged). (This was the only topic for which the main boolean query used a NOT operator.)</p><p>• Topic 43 ("contracts with medical supply companies or outfitters"):</p><p>This topic had the biggest difference in P@B and PJ@B in favour of the boolean run (as per the "t-tv" entries of Tables <ref type="table" coords="9,252.54,612.08,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_5">7</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="9,293.92,612.08,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_6">8</ref>).</p><p>The main boolean query ((contract! OR agreement! OR "purchase order" OR invoice) AND ("medical suppl!" OR outfitter!)) matched 652 records (216 judged, 66 judged relevant).</p><p>The main vector query ('contract%'|'agreement%'|'purchase'|'order'|'invoice'|'medical'|'suppl%'| 'outfitter%') found just 8 relevant items in the first 652 records. It appears that the "medical" concept was important for relevance, but the "suppl%" and "purchase" terms had more weight from inverse document frequency, and it hurt precision when these terms were not restricted to being Topics strongly favoring the vector run (in at least one metric):</p><p>• Topic 7 ("company guidelines, strategies, or internal approval for placement of tobacco products in movies that are mentioned as G-rated"): This topic had the biggest differences in R@B, P@B, PJ@B and bpref in favour of the vector run (as per the "t-tv" entries of Tables <ref type="table" coords="10,177.25,523.63,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_3">5</ref><ref type="table" coords="10,181.23,523.63,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_4">6</ref><ref type="table" coords="10,181.23,523.63,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_5">7</ref><ref type="table" coords="10,185.22,523.63,3.99,10.46" target="#tab_6">8</ref>).</p><p>The main boolean query (((guide! OR strateg! OR approv!) AND (place! or promot!)) AND (("G-rated" OR "G rated" OR family) W/5 (movie! OR film! OR picture!))) matched 645 records (226 judged, 9 relevant), while the vector query</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="10,96.91,559.49,432.77,22.41">('guide%'|'strateg%'|'approv%'|'place%'|'promot%'|'G'|'rated'|'G'|'rated'|'family'| 'movie%'|'film%'|'picture%'</formula><p>) found 73 relevant items in the first 645. The boolean query formulation did not match relevant items with passages such as ""G" and 'PG"-rated movies" or even ""G"-rated film" (because the query only allowed 1 punctuation character between "G" and "rated"). Also, the assessor seems to have allowed "PG" as a synonym (e.g. "rated PG"). The boolean query's matches typically had "family" near a word like "moviegoer" or "film", which typically were not relevant. This topic is an example of the difficulties of forming a good boolean query.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Retrieval Measures</head><p>The ad hoc retrieval measures of Tables <ref type="table" coords="18,249.36,591.58,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="18,277.03,591.58,9.96,10.46" target="#tab_11">13</ref> are defined as follows:</p><p>• Recall@5000 (R@5000): For a topic, R@5000 is the percentage of the relevant items retrieved in the first 5000 rows.</p><p>• Precision@n: For a topic, "precision" is the percentage of retrieved documents which are relevant. "Precision@n" is the precision after n documents have been retrieved. This paper lists Precision@10 (P10) for all ad hoc runs.</p><p>• R-Precision: For a topic, R-Prec is the precision at rank R, where R is the number of relevant items for the topic.</p><p>• Average Precision (AP): For a topic, AP is the average of the precision after each relevant item is retrieved (using zero as the precision for relevant items which are not retrieved). (In this paper, AP is based on the first 5000 retrieved items for the Legal runs and the first 10000 retrieved items for Terabyte runs.) The score ranges from 0.0 (no relevants found) to 1.0 (all relevants found at the top of the list). "Mean Average Precision" (MAP) is the mean of the average precision scores over all of the topics (i.e. all topics are weighted equally).</p><p>• Binary Preference: bpref is based just on the relative ranking of judged items, defined in <ref type="bibr" coords="19,488.42,185.08,9.96,10.46" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>• Geometric MAP (GMAP): GMAP (introduced in <ref type="bibr" coords="19,316.26,205.00,15.50,10.46" target="#b21">[22]</ref>) is based on "Log Average Precision" which for a topic is the natural log of the max of 0.00001 and the average precision. GMAP is the exponential of the mean log average precision.</p><p>• GMAP' : GMAP' linearly maps the 'log average precision' values to the [0,1] interval, putting the individual topic scores on the same scale as the other measures and allowing the arithmetic mean to be used as normal. GMAP' produces the same system rankings as GMAP and the same conclusions for statistical significance purposes.</p><p>• Reciprocal Rank (RR): For a topic, RR is 1 r where r is the rank of the first relevant item, or zero if no relevant item is retrieved. "Mean Reciprocal Rank" (MRR) is the mean of the reciprocal ranks over all the topics.</p><p>• Success@n (S@n): For a topic, Success@n is 1 if a desired page is found in the first n rows, 0 otherwise. This paper lists Success@10 (S10) and Success@1 (S1) for most runs. (Success@5 (S5) and Success@1000 (S1000) are also sometimes listed.)</p><p>• Generalized Success@10 (GenS@10 or GS10): For a topic, GS10 is 1.08 1-r where r is the rank of the first relevant item, or zero if no relevant item is retrieved. (This measure was known as "First Relevant Score" (FRS) last year.) GS10 is considered a generalization of Success@10 because it rounds to 1 for r≤10 and to 0 for r&gt;10.</p><p>• Generalized Success@30 (GenS@30 or GS30): For a topic, GS30 is 1.024 1-r where r is the rank of the first relevant item, or zero if no relevant item is retrieved.</p><p>We attach a J suffix to the measure (e.g. GS10J, S10J, S1J, MAPJ, P10J, R-PrecJ, bprefJ, GMAPJ, MAPJ, R@5000J) when unjudged items are omitted rather than being assumed non-relevant. Note that our MAPJ measure is the same as the "induced AP (indAP)" measure of <ref type="bibr" coords="19,378.14,505.88,14.61,10.46" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p><p>For all measures, the mean scores weight each included topic equally. The boolean set measures of Tables <ref type="table" coords="19,245.49,529.78,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="19,273.16,529.78,4.98,10.46">3</ref> are defined as follows:</p><p>• B : B is the number of items matched by the main boolean run (humL06t). For the @B measures, topics with B≥5000 are omitted (leaving just 23 topics instead of the usual 39 for Legal runs).</p><p>• Precision@B : For a topic, Precision@B (P@B) is the precision after B items have been retrieved. (If fewer than B items were retrieved, the number of relevant items retrieved is still divided by B.)</p><p>• PJ@B : For a topic, PJ@B is the same as P@B except that the precision is just based on the judged items in the first B retrieved; if no judged items were retrieved in the first B items, then a score of 0 was assigned.</p><p>• Recall@B : For a topic, Recall@B (R@B) is the percentage of the relevant items retrieved in the first B rows.</p><p>• Judged@B : For a topic, Judged@B (J@B) is the percentage of the first B retrieved items that are judged (relevant or non-relevant). If fewer than B items were retrieved, we (perhaps unfortunately) divided the number of judged items by the actual number of retrieved items (not B).</p><p>• Retrieved@B : For a topic, Retrieved@B (ret@B) is the number of retrieved items divided by B (capped at 100% for each topic).</p><p>• B2 : B2 is the number of items matched by the updated boolean run (humL06t'). P@B2, PJ@B2, R@B2, J@B2 and ret@B2 are the same as P@B, PJ@B, R@B, J@B and ret@B (respectively) except that the first B2 retrieved items are examined instead of the first B. For the @B2 measures, topics with B2≥5000 are omitted (leaving just 24 topics).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Difference Tables</head><p>For the comparison tables (Tables 4-10, 14 and 18), the columns are as follows:</p><p>• "Expt" specifies the experiment (the codes of the two runs being compared are in parentheses, indicating first run minus second run).</p><p>• "∆" is the difference of the mean scores of the two runs being compared (the column heading says for which retrieval measure).</p><p>• "95% Conf" is an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean difference (calculated from plus/minus twice the standard error of the mean difference). If zero is not in the interval, the result is "statistically significant" (at the 5% level), i.e. the feature is unlikely to be of neutral impact (on average), though if the average difference is small (e.g. &lt;0.020) it may still be too minor to be considered "significant" in the magnitude sense.</p><p>• "vs." is the number of topics on which the first run scored higher, lower and tied (respectively) compared to the second run. These numbers should always add to the number of topics.</p><p>• "3 Extreme Diffs (Topic)" lists 3 of the individual topic differences, each followed by the topic number in brackets. The first difference is the largest one of any topic (based on the absolute value). The third difference is the largest difference in the other direction (so the first and third differences give the range of differences observed in this experiment). The middle difference is the largest of the remaining differences (based on the absolute value).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In the Legal Track, we analyzed several topics in detail and found that the negotiations often led to a boolean query that was superior to a vector query of the same terms, in various retrieval metrics. However, on average, the final negotiated boolean query matched less than half of the judged relevant items.</p><p>In both the Legal and Terabyte Tracks, we looked at both robust and non-robust measures, and they produced the anticipated opposing conclusions about feedback approaches. Robust metrics (such as GenS@10) favor negative feedback techniques, such as duplicate filtering, while non-robust metrics (such as MAP, R-Prec and P10) favor positive feedback techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback (blind feedback). For most ad hoc tasks, we would like the organizers to use a robust metric (such as GenS@10) as the main measure. But robust metrics are not appropriate for legal discovery because filtering suspected duplicates is not appropriate in this task.</p><p>In our depth probe experiments (depth 9000 in the Legal Track and depth 5000 in the Terabyte Track), we demonstrated that, on average, less than 20% of the relevant items are assessed for the Legal topics and less than 40% of the relevant items are assessed for the Terabyte adhoc topics. Relevant items were found to occur deeply in the results, implying that sampling techniques should look deeper than 9000 rows.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,531.90,400.27,8.10,10.46;3,72.00,412.23,294.49,10.46;3,82.46,434.15,329.51,10.46;3,92.93,446.10,339.98,10.46"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>", the WHERE clause of the corresponding SearchSQL statement was WHERE FT_TEXT CONTAINS 'All'|'that'|'refer'|'or'|'relate'|'to'| 'pigeon'|'deaths'|'during'|'the'|'course'|'of'|'animal'|'studies'</figDesc></figure>
