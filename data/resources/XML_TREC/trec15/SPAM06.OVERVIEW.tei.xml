<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>TREC's Spam Track uses a standard testing framework that presents a set of chronologically ordered email messages a spam filter for classification. In the filtering task, the messages are presented one at at time to the filter, which yields a binary judgement (spam or ham [i.e. non-spam]) which is compared to a humanadjudicated gold standard. The filter also yields a spamminess score, intended to reflect the likelihood that the classified message is spam, which is the subject of post-hoc ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis. Two forms of user feedback are modeled: with immediate feedback the gold standard for each message is communicated to the filter immediately following classification; with delayed feedback the gold standard is communicated to the filter sometime later, so as to model a user reading email from time to time in batches. A new task -active learning -presents the filter with a large collection of unadjudicated messages, and has the filter request adjudication for a subset of them before classifying a set of future messages. Four test corpora -email messages plus gold standard judgements -were used to evaluate subject filters. Two of the corpora (the public corpora, one English and one Chinese) were distributed to participants, who ran their filters on the corpora using a track-supplied toolkit implementing the framework. Two of the corpora (the private corpora) were not distributed to participants; rather, participants submitted filter implementations that were run, using the toolkit, on the private data. Nine groups participated in the track, each submitting up to four filters for evaluation in each of the three tasks (filtering with immediate feedback; filtering with delayed feedback; active learning).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Spam Track Tasks</head><p>Broadly speaking, there were two spam track tasks: filtering, in which participant filters performed online classification with simulated user feedback; and active learning, in which participant filters were given a large number of historical email messages and allowed to request adjudication by the user for some of them before classifying a set of new messages. Task guidelines and tools may be found on the web at http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/˜gvcormac/spam/ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Filtering -Immediate Feedback</head><p>The immediate feedback filtering task is identical to the TREC 2005 task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,396.49,572.25,11.70,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A chronological sequence of messages is presented to the filter using a standard interface. The the filter classifies each message in turn as either spam or ham, also computes a spamminess score indicating its confidence that the message is spam. The test setup simulates an ideal user who communicates the correct (gold standard) classification to the filter for each message immediately after the filter classifies it. Participants were supplied with tools, sample filters, and sample corpora (including the TREC 2005 public corpus) for training and development. Filters were evaluated on four new corpora developed for TREC 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Filtering -Delayed Feedback</head><p>Real user's don't immediately report the correct classification to filters. They read their email some time, typically in batches, some time after it is classified. The delayed filtering task simulates this delay in the following manner: the filter is asked to classify some number of messages without feedback; after these messages are classified, feedback is given, in the same order the messages are classified, using the same standard interface as for the filtering task. The only apparent difference to the filter is that each classification request is not immediately followed by training for the classified message. The exact sequence of classification requests and feedback is determined by a special index file supplied with the corpus. The delay intervals were selected at random using an exponential distribution with a mean corresponding to several day's delay -from 500 to 1000 messages, depending on the corpus. While the intervals were randomly generated, there was no variation in the presentation of feedback to the various filters; each filter saw exactly the same sequence. Tools for training and development were supplied to participants in advance; index files specifying feedback delay were supplied for the the training corpora. Filters were evaluated on the same four corpora used for immediate feedback, augmented by index files with randomly generated delay.</p><p>It was anticipated that the delayed feedback task would be more difficult for the filters, and that filters might be able to harness information from unlabeled messages (one for which feedback had not yet occurred) to improve performance.</p><p>The track coordinator considered, in addition, the use of incomplete feedback in which the true classification for some messages was never communicated to the filter. While this scenario more closely models that of real filter deployment, we argue that this situation is aptly modeled by the task as deployed. Since the filter is always trained on past data and asked to classify future data, using incomplete judgements would simply be equivalent to using a smaller corpus of training data. Resource constraints limited the number of corpora we were able to use, and it was decided that the largest possible corpora would yield the highest statistical power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The Active Learning Task</head><p>The active learning task models the situation in which a spam filter is first deployed. We assume that many historical email messages are available, but that these messages have not been adjudicated as ham or spam. The filter examines these messages as a batch (although it knows their chronology) and asks the user (or administrator) to adjudicate several before being deployed to filter new messages. For the active learning task each corpus was divided chronologically in the ratio 9 : 1. The (chronologically) first 90% of the messages were given to the filter without classification, while the last 90% were held back for testing. For n = 100, 200, 400, 800, ... filters were allowed to query the true classification of n messages selected by the filter. Based on the results of these queries, the filters were then required to classify the test messages in sequence. The learning task was effected by a shell program, written in C++, which read the entire corpus index (including gold standard judgements) and simulated n queries by examining the index. Filter classification and training were effected using the same interface as for the filtering tasks, but this interface was between the shell program and the participant filter, both of which were under control of the participant. A single run of the shell program was used to simulate, in succession, all values of n ≤ m where m is the number of messages in the corpus. A standard shell which selected n messages at random was supplied as a baseline; participants were invited to modify the shell to use a better strategy, while adhering to the constraint that the labels for at most n messages should be used in classification. Training and development was effected on the same training corpora as for the filtering tasks; the same evaluation corpora were used as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation Measures</head><p>We used the same evaluation measures developed for TREC 2005. The tables and figures in this overview report Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves, as well as 1 -ROCA(%) -the area above the ROC curve, indicating the probability that a random spam message will receive a lower spamminess score than a random ham message.</p><p>The appendix contains detailed summary reports for each participant run, including ROC curves, 1-ROCA%, and the following statistics. The ham misclassification percentage (hm% ) is the fraction of all ham classified as spam; the spam misclassification percentage (sm% ) is the fraction of all spam classified as ham.</p><p>There is a natural tension between ham and spam misclassification percentages. A filter may improve one at the expense of the other. Most filters, either internally or externally, compute a spamminess score that reflects the filter's estimate of the likelihood that a message is spam. This score is compared against some fixed threshold t to determine the ham/spam classification. Increasing t reduces hm% while increasing sm% and vice versa. Given the score for each message, it is possible to compute sm% as a function of hm% (that is, sm% when t is adjusted to as to achieve a specific hm% ) or vice versa. The graphical representation of this function is a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve; alternatively a recall-fallout curve. The area under the ROC curve is a cumulative measure of the effectiveness of the filter over all possible values. ROC area also has a probabilistic interpretation: the probability that a random ham will receive a lower score than a random spam. For consistency with hm% and sm%, which measure failure rather than effectiveness, spam track reports the area above the ROC curve, as a percentage ( (1 -ROCA)% ). The appendix further reports sm% when the threshold is adjusted to achieve several specific levels of hm%, and vice versa. A single quality measure, based only on the filter's binary ham/spam classifications, is nonetheless desirable. To this end, the appendix reports logistic average misclassification percentage (lam% ) defined as lam% = logit -<ref type="foot" coords="3,97.38,199.25,5.10,6.97" target="#foot_1">1</ref> ( logit(hm%)+logit (sm%)  4 Spam Filter Evaluation Tool Kit All filter evaluations were performed using the TREC Spam Filter Evaluation Toolkit, developed for this purpose. The toolkit is free software and is readily portable. Participants were required to provide filter implementations for Linux or Windows implementing five commandline operations mandated by the toolkit:</p><p>• initialize -creates any files or servers necessary for the operation of the filter Track guidelines prohibited filters from using network resources, and constrained temporary disk storage (1 GB), RAM (1 GB), and run-time (2 sec/message, amortized). These limits were enforced incrementally, so that individual long-running filters were granted more than 2 seconds provided the overall average time was less than 2 second per query plus one minute to facilitate start-up. The toolkit takes as input a test corpus consisting of a set of email messages, one per file, and an index file indicating the chronological sequence and gold-standard judgements for the messages. It calls on the filter to classify each message in turn, records the result, and at some time later (perhaps immediately) communicates the gold standard judgement to the filter. Participants were supplied as well, with an active learning shell, active.cpp, which they modified to effect the active learning task. The recorded results are post-processed by an evaluation component supplied with the toolkit. This component computes statistics, confidence intervals, and graphs summarizing the filter's performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Test Corpora</head><p>For TREC 2006, we used two public corpora, one English and one Chinese, as well as two private corpora derived from the same users' email as the TREC 2005 private corpora. 14000 ham messages were crawled from the web. Only messages with complete "Received from" headers were selected; the messages were ordered by the time and date on the first such header. These messages were adjudicated by human judges assisted by several spam filters -DMC <ref type="bibr" coords="4,397.08,198.81,10.57,9.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , Bogofilter and SpamProbeusing the methodology developed for TREC 21005. About 1000 spam messages were discovered in this set; 12910 were ham. The 14000 crawled messages were augmented by approximately 38000 spam messages collected in May 2006. Each spam message was paired with a ham message. The header of the spam message was altered to make it appear to have been addressed to the same recipient and delivered to the same mail server during the same time frame as the ham message. "To:" and "From:" headers, as well as the message bodies, were altered to substitute names and email addresses consistent with the addressee. SpamProbe and Bogofilter were run on the corpora, and their dictionaries examined, to identify artifacts that might identify these messages. A handful were detected and removed; for example, incorrect uses of daylight saving time, and incorrect versions of server software in header information. The DMC spam filter was run on the corpus several times and disagreements between the filter and the recorded judgement were adjudicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Public English Corpus -trec06p</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Public Chinese Corpus -trec06c</head><p>The Public Chinese corpus used data provided by the CERNET Computer Emergency Response Team (CCERT) at Tsinghuaua University, Beijing. The ham messages consisted of those send by to a mailing list; the spam messages were those sent to a spam trap in the same internet domain. Headers and bodies of spam messages were modified to make them appear to have been delivered to the same servers as the ham messages, in the same time interval. Both the ham and spam messages were modified to as to remove structural elements not in common with those of the other class, such as embedded signature files, certain kinds of HTML markup, and the like. Pilot filtering using DMC revealed that the Chinese corpus was quite easy to classify; it was felt nevertheless that the corpus would reveal any western bias in filtering strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Private Corpus -MrX2</head><p>The MrX2 corpus was derived from the same source as the MrX corpus used for TREC 2005. For comparability with MrX, a random subset of X's email from October 2005 through April 2006 was selected so as to yield the same corpus size and ham/spam ratio as for MrX. This selection involved primarily the elimination of spam messages, whose volume had increased about 50% since the 2003-2004 interval in which the original MrX corpus was collection. Ham volume was insubstantially different.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Private Corpus -SB2</head><p>The SB2 corpus was collected from the same source as last year's SB corpus. Spam volume tripled since last year; all delivered messages were used in the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Aggregate Pseudo-Corpus</head><p>The subject filters were run separately on the various corpora. That is, each filter was subject to eight test runs -four with immediate feedback and four with delayed feedback. For each filter and each type of feedback, an aggregate run was created combining its results on the four corpora as if they were one. The evaluation component of the toolkit was run on the aggregate results, consisting of 163,641 messages for each type of feedback -52,989 spam and 110,652 ham. The summary results on the aggregate runs provide a composite view of the performance on all corpora, but are not the results of running the filter on an aggregate corpus; hence we dub the aggregate a pseudo-corpus. Nine groups participated in the TREC 2006 filtering tasks; five of them also participated in the active learning task. For each task, each participant submitted up to four filter implementations for evaluation on the private corpora; in addition, each participant ran the same filters on the public corpora, which were made available follwoing filter submission. All test runs are labelled with an identifier whose prefix indicates the group and filter priority and whose suffix indicates the corpus to which the filter is applied. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,534.99,491.25,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the identifier prefix for each submitted filter. All test runs have a suffix indicating the corpus and task, detailed in figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,173.06,515.25,4.98,9.96">3</ref> .    </p></div>
