<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents our approach to retargeting the information retrieval systems designed and/or optimized for retrieval of MEDLINE citations to the task of finding relevant passages in the text of scientific articles. To continue using our TREC 2005 fusion approach, we needed a common representation for the full text biomedical articles to be shared by the four base systems (Essie, SMART, EasyIR and Theme.) The base systems relied upon previously developed NLP, statistical and ML methods. The fusion of the automatic runs improved the results of three contributing base systems at 99.9% significance level on all metrics: document, passage, and aspect precision. The fusion run outperformed Essie, the best of the base systems, at 94% to 99% significance level, with the exception of passage precision.</p><p>The novelty of the task and the lack of training data inspired our exploration of an interactive approach. The prohibitive cost (in time and domain expert effort) required for a truly interactive retrieval led to a team interaction with one of the base systems -Essie. The initial queries were developed by a computational biologist and a medical librarian. The librarian merged and then refined the queries upon inspecting the initial search results. The refined queries were submitted as a batch without further interaction with the system. The interactive results, the best we achieved, improved over the baseline automatic Essie run at the 91% significance level. The difference between the fusion and the interactive results is not statistically significant.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The single task of the TREC genomics track 2006 focused on finding passages containing information relevant to topics expressed as questions. The task posed several challenges for our base information retrieval systems optimized for indexing and retrieval of MEDLINE Â® citations. The documents for this task were scientific articles in HTML format. The expected results were passages --spans of text that cannot cross an HTML paragraph boundary. As it was not clear if finding the best documents and then the relevant passages would be better than finding the spans with the high density of relevant terms first, a hierarchical XML representation of each citation ranging from sentences to documents was created (see Section 2.1). After experimenting with the two sample topics, we decided to use the maximumlength legal spans (the passages delimited by the HTML paragraph tags) as a retrieval unit. The spans retrieved by the base systems were merged using the sum fusion method <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.14,582.82,91.97,9.02" target="#b2">(Fox and Shaw, 1994)</ref> described in Section 2.3.</p><p>Observing that the results obtained automatically for two sample topics were not satisfactory, we decided to experiment with manual and interactive query refinement, in addition to automatic query generation. Our approach to interactive retrieval is described in Section 3. To our surprise, the difference in document average precision between the fusion of automatic runs and the interactive run is not statistically significant. The difference between these runs in passage and aspect precision is significant only at the 90% level. Section 4 provides a detailed description of our results. Section 5 contains some conclusions about the work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Automatic Retrieval</head><p>In the automatic fusion run we combined the retrieval results of four systems (Essie, EasyIR, SMART, and Theme) each of which is known to perform well for some IR tasks. Our fusion approach consisted of normalizing the scores from each system on a query by query basis and then using these normalized scores to compute a new combined score for the union of all results returned by all four systems. The top 1,000 results were selected based on the combined score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Document preparation</head><p>The Highwire collection was processed to convert the HTML source to XML coded paragraph text. The Perl programming language was used to manually construct conditions (discovered by inspection and sampling of the collection) in order to remove nondisplayed HTML tags, record internal section names, recognize titles, headers, and likely text, recognize and omit bibliographic sections, and convert escape symbols and glyph images to approximate ASCII equivalents. The result was then coded in UTF-8 and saved in a hierarchical XML structure representing the document, internally defined sections, paragraphs (as determined by the &lt;P&gt; tags), and titles, headers, and paragraphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Basic automatic approaches</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Essie</head><p>Essie is a concept-based search engine for structured biomedical text. Searches use token adjacency indexes to find sequences of tokens (a phrase search instead of just a word search.)</p><p>Fine-grained tokenization treats every punctuation mark as significant.</p><p>Queries are automatically expanded before search. UMLS Â® terms are recognized and expanded with their synonyms. Then the original term and its synonyms are both automatically expanded with a conservative set of word variants from the SPECIALIST Lexicon: plurals, possessives, hyphenation, compound words, and alternative spellings. Stemming and inflection (other than plural/singular) are not used.</p><p>A relaxation strategy breaks long phrases into subphrases and individual words.</p><p>Each piece is expanded with synonymy and word variants. All combinations of pieces that span the original query are evaluated. Thus a search for "heart attack in older adults" will find "myocardial infarction in seniors". A lossy strategy allows some fragments to be missing.</p><p>Essie ranks results with an "all the right stuff in all the right places" strategy. Terms generated through relaxation, synonymy, and word variants are discounted relative to the original query. Terms found in high value regions of a document, such as a title, are weighted more than those found in low value regions, such as addendums or footnotes. This latter strategy has been shown to be very effective but relies on a structured XML document format that is not always available.</p><p>Essie was first evaluated in the TREC 2003 Genomics Track, where it produced the high score of 0.42 mean average precision (MAP). Essie is in production use as the search engine for ClinicalTrials.gov.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data.</head><p>The TREC 2006 corpus consisted of full text HTML journal articles. The HTML was converted to XML with a sentence parser which inserted tags at sentence boundaries, paragraph boundaries, and around the full text as described in Section 2.1. There was some error in this process, since not all sentences fell within the legal ranges provided later.</p><p>&lt;DOC FILE="file-name"&gt; &lt;SECTION NUMBER="num" NAME="name"&gt; &lt;PARAGRAPH NUMBER="num"&gt; &lt;TITLE ID="id" NUMBER="num" OFFSET="offset" LENGTH="len"&gt;â¦&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;HEADER1 ID="id" NUMBER="num" OFFSET="offset" LENGTH="len"&gt;â¦&lt;/HEADER1&gt; &lt;HEADER2 ID="id" NUMBER="num" OFFSET="offset" LENGTH="len"&gt;â¦&lt;/HEADER2&gt; &lt;PARAGRAPH ID="id" NUMBER="num" OFFSET="offset" LENGTH="len"&gt;â¦&lt;/PARAGRAPH&gt; &lt;/PARAGRAPH&gt; &lt;/SECTION&gt; &lt;/DOC&gt; Essie was configured to treat paragraph elements as documents. Searches found relevant paragraphs, which were then trimmed as described in the Passages section below to produce relevant passages. Two preliminary trimming strategies, 1) find relevant sentences and merge to form passages and 2) find relevant full text documents and trim to form passages, were considered and abandoned.</p><p>Queries. The automatic query formulation took advantage of two factors: 1) Essie query expansion capabilities, especially based on the UMLS-derived synonymy, and 2) the structure of the Generic Topic Types (GTTs) underlying the genomics track topics that allows for in-depth semantic analysis.</p><p>The topics for the 2006 genomics track are questions based on the Generic Topic Types (GTTs). The GTTs contain: 1) one or more biological objects (genes, proteins, gene mutations, etc.), 2) one or more biological processes (physiological processes or diseases), and 3) a relationship between the objects and the processes. The first two components of GTTs were identified automatically using named entity extraction tools. All topics were processed using MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="3,117.76,212.36,70.59,9.02" target="#b0">(Aronson, 2001)</ref> to identify biological processes and objects. Based on the sample queries and template descriptions, the following semantic types were manually categorized as "related to processes": all children of the UMLS semantic type Event (for example, Disease or Syndrome, Neoplastic Process, Cell Function, etc.), children of the semantic type Anatomical Structure excluding Gene or Genome <ref type="bibr" coords="3,109.73,304.37,178.36,9.02;3,71.99,315.89,190.03,9.02">(for example, Cell, Cell Component, Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component, etc.)</ref>, and children of the semantic type Substance, excluding Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, and Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide. Terms extracted from the topics using this strategy were dubbed clinical.</p><p>Extraction of "biological objects" was treated as gene and protein name recognition. In addition to the UMLS semantic types Gene or Genome, Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, and Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide, gene names were recognized in the topics using ABGene <ref type="bibr" coords="3,135.44,442.33,109.83,9.02" target="#b10">(Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002)</ref>, and then expanded automatically using the Entrez Gene 1 synonymy. Terms extracted from the topics using this strategy were named gene. A third group of query terms, named other was identified using a heuristic for recognizing potential interesting terms missed by the first two tools. According to this rule all words containing upper and lower case, numbers and/or punctuation were extracted, if not present in the other two groups.</p><p>No question understanding or recognition of relations was attempted. To use the potentially important terms identifying a relationship, the whole original question was added to each query.</p><p>The final queries were assembled as a union of the original question with the intersection of three groups of the extracted terms (terms within groups were ORed): (CLINICAL_TERM(s) AND GENE(s) AND OTHER) OR QUERY. To retrieve documents Due to inconsistent HTML tagging and inaccessible document structure, some highly ranked paragraphs 1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=g ene containing some but not all terms, each term was ORed with a small constant weight. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,499.58,85.86,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the query automatically generated for topic 172. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,367.32,227.46,3.77,9.02" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, a clinical term apoptosis identified as Cell Function is ANDed with the gene p53. Terms identified as UMLS concepts are not expanded in the queries because of Essie's built-in morphologic and UMLS derived expansion. When no expansion type is indicated, the concept based expansion is applied by default. Synonyms found using Entrez Gene (CG10873, CG31325, CG33336, DmP53, dp53, and prac) are ORed with the original query terms. A term expansion operator that expands a term using its morphological variants was applied to synonyms. Lossy expansion described above is applied to the question. Because lossy expansion results might be quite noisy, a small weight assigned to this part of the query ensures that documents containing all extracted terms are promoted to the top of the ranked list.</p><p>In all topics, only three terms were identified as other: Nurr-77, HPV11, and GFs. For the most part the clinical and the gene terms were identified correctly, however in several cases the terms were misplaced due to the UMLS ambiguity. For example, APC and adenomatous polyposis coli were assigned to different groups, APC was recognized as gene, but adenomatous polyposis coli was mapped to Neoplastic Process; L2 was recognized by MetaMap as Body Location or Region, but L1 was recognized as gene.</p><p>Manual Retrieval. The placement of the above mistagged terms was corrected in the query formulation for our manual run. In addition, queries containing the term Nurr-77 were augmented with the term Nur-77. The remaining manual queries do not differ from the automatic queries.</p><p>Passages. Essie produced a ranked set of paragraphs which were trimmed to produce passage candidates. The trimming process maintained the relevancy ranking, but dropped problematic paragraphs.</p><p>were inappropriate. Paragraphs were found with more than 50 sentences. Inspection revealed that some of these were miss-tagged unions of many paragraphs, and some were reference sections. References have many interesting terms as part of citation titles and are therefore ranked highly in the Essie search results. Any paragraph with over 30 sentences was dropped. Paragraphs were also found with a single sentence, more than 1,000 characters long. This case was caused by tables and other data structures tagged as paragraphs. Paragraphs with a single sentence longer than 500 characters were dropped. Note that paragraphs with one or two sentences are often titles and captions, and are not necessarily bad passages.</p><p>The remaining paragraphs consist of sentences, some f which have query terms in them. Leading and ART run involved indexing each of with SMART <ref type="bibr" coords="4,199.59,454.32,53.42,9.02" target="#b7">(Salton, 1971</ref>), using u) eighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="4,148.24,626.82,85.96,9.02" target="#b8">(Singhal et al., 1996)</ref>  If the remaining sentences did not contain gaps, defined as a series of 4 sentences without query terms, they were kept as a passage. When gaps were present, the sentences were divided at the gaps into multiple candidate passages. Again, leading and trailing sentences without query terms were dropped. If one of the candidates was clearly the best, containing at least two more query terms than any other, it was kept as the passage. Otherwise the paragraph was abandoned and no passage extracted.</p><p>.</p></div>

See <ref type="bibr" coords="4,118.16,477.30,50.74,9.02" target="#b6">(Ruiz, 2006)</ref> for details. Due to the size of the indexes produced by SMART, we split the collection into three subsets that would generate indexes less than 2GB in size. This meant that we had to create three sub-collections (A, B, and C) and submit the queries to each of the sub-collections. The final SMART run was generated by merging the results obtained from the three sub-collections. This merging process used the same algorithm as the general fusion code created to combine runs from all participating systems in the NLM fusion run.</p><p>We use the pivoted length normalization (Lnu.lt w 0.25 and pivot = average document term in each subcollection (where pivot_a = 32.435, pivot_b = 30.4005, and pivoc_c = 33.4440).

All remaining phrases, excepting stop words, were lumped together with the theme phrases. All phrases were queried separately, expanded using the themebased query expansion, and the results from query synonyms were combined with OR. All of the phrases were then combined with AND. Finally, the result was rescored to prefer paragraphs containing the explicit gene name (if one was found), and paragraphs mentioning genes and proteins generally. A of IDE in Alzheimer's disease?". The gene "IDE" was found by ABGene and was expanded to the synonym "insulysin".

In this query, the AND/OR operations with subscript 1 correspond to the min/max fuzzy set operators, and the subscript 2 correspond to multiplicative fuzzy set operators. Non-subscripted operators within queries are Boolean, in the usual sense.

The automatically constructed query that includes gene synonyms achieved 0.8 precision in the automatic Essie run, whereas precision is 0.08 for the interactive run. For topic 183, however, the unexpanded automatic query achieved precision 0.3, but the precision of the expanded interactive query was only 0.06, probably because the over-expanded "clinical" part of the query skewed the results. The same reasoning might be appropriate for topic 187: the term "hippocampal" was not identified by any of the automatic methods, and is therefore missing in the automatic query. Adding the term to the interactive query brought its precision down to 0.33 from the original 1. Topic 168 also is over-expanded in the interactive query.

The comparison of the interactive results with the baseline performance and with fusion shows that over-expansion and/or unbalanced expansion of a query degrades the performance. This of course could be quickly corrected in a real interactive retrieval.</p><p>It is quite interesting that the fusion approach seems to be able to mimic the improvement in results obtained through user intervention. This suggests th the different automatic approaches highlight different shades of domain knowledge.</p><p>Finally, we are convinced that the interactive approach should have produced better results than it did.
