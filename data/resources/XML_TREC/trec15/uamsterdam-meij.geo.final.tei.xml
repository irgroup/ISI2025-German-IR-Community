<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper we describe our participation in the TREC 2006 Genomics track. One of our working hypotheses is that finding synonymous terms while, at the same time, coping with ambiguous terms is essential. We propose several methods, collection-specific as well as web-based, to identify synonymous terms. To counter any possible query drift, we impose additional constraints on the expansion terms we find.</p><p>Additionally, we include the results of post-submission experiments, in which we have evaluated different passage lengths, stemming, and different retrieval engines.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In * Currently at Collexis, e-mail: jansen@collexis.com Section 2 we describe our collection preprocessing and passage identification. Next, in Section 3 we introduce the retrieval models which we evaluated during this year's edition of TREC Genomics. We then elaborate on our proposed query expansion techniques in Section 4, and follow with a description of our submitted runs in Section 5. The results can be found in Section 6, and we summarize our findings in a concluding section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Experimental Setup</head><p>In this section we elaborate on the particular tools and methods used for indexing and retrieving. We describe the way we handle passage indentification as well as the way we preprocess the collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Collection Preprocessing</head><p>The 2006 Genomics document collection consists of 162,259 full-text biomedical articles, which were preprocessed as follows:</p><p>1. replace HTML entities with their ISO-Latin1 counterparts, The used stopword list includes common task-specific terms such as "figure," "table," "view," "larger," "version," "interactions," "role," and "contribute."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Passage Identification</head><p>This year's Genomics track introduced a novel task. Unlike previous years, participants were requested to return relevant passages instead of entire documents and the systems are judged based on 3 levels of granularity: returned documents, passages, and aspects. We have chosen to mainly focus on documents and passages for our participation.</p><p>We experimented with various ways of identifying passages, and for our submissions we decided to consider every sentence as being a passage-which we identify using Lingpipe's sentence extractor <ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.64,194.62,10.58,8.97" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Every sentence gets indexed as a separate (pseudo-)document and we include positional information and the originating PubMed ID in the index. The intuition behind this approach is to yield relatively high precision, since query terms should appear within the same sentence.</p><p>The maximum length of any retrieved passage was delimited by paragraph tags in the original HTML files. As a comparison, we also indexed every paragraph as a separate pseudodocument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Retrieval Models</head><p>This section describes the models employed by the evaluated retrieval engines. All of our initially submitted runs were created using Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="2,161.16,393.27,16.59,8.97" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with a multinomial language modeling extension that we developed in-house <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.88,405.22,10.58,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As postsubmission experiments we include the results of using the default Lucene retrieval model, as well as Lemur and Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="2,67.36,441.09,15.27,8.97" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Lucene -Language Modeling</head><p>We estimate a language model for each pseudo-document and for any given query we rank the documents with respect to the likelihood that the document language model generated the query:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,120.61,539.71,168.42,23.51">P(d|q) ∝ P(d) • ∏ t∈q P(t|d), (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,289.03,545.22,3.87,8.97">)</formula><p>where d is a document and t is a term in query q. In the implemented scoring formula the probabilities are reduced to rank-equivalent logs of probabilities. To account for data sparseness, we interpolate the likelihood P(t|d) using Jelinek-Mercer smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.62,623.27,10.79,8.97" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.83,623.27,12.45,8.97" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.69,623.27,11.83,8.97" target="#b19">19]</ref>. This can be viewed as estimating the probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,68.72,650.92,224.19,23.51">P(d|q) = P(d) • ∏ t∈q ((1 -λ) • P(t|D) + λ • P(t|d)) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where D is the collection. We need to estimate three probabilities: the prior probability of the document, P(d); the probability of observing a term in a document, P(t|d);</p><p>and the probability of observing the term in the collection, P(t|D). We assume the query terms to be independent, and use a linear interpolation of a document model and a collection model to estimate the probability of a query term.</p><p>The probabilities are estimated using maximum likelihood estimates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,379.03,152.52,176.89,22.32">P(t|d) = tf (t, d) |d| ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,377.33,181.04,178.58,24.13">P(t|D) = df (t, D) ∑ t ∈D df (t , D) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="2,384.99,209.52,170.93,24.13">P(d) = |d| ∑ d ∈D |d | ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where tf (t, d) is the termfrequency of term t in document d; df (t) is the count of documents in which term t occurs, and |d| denotes the length of a document d <ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.79,270.15,10.58,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The risk with parameter estimation using maximum likelihood estimates in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="2,429.19,309.08,3.74,8.97" target="#formula_2">2</ref>, is the underestimation of unseen or rare terms and overestimation of frequently occuring ones. Especially when dealing with very short documents (such as sentences) this bias becomes clearly visible.</p><p>To compensate, we smooth our language model in Equation 2 using collection frequencies rather than document frequencies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.26,380.81,15.27,8.97" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. The parameter λ is the smoothing parameter, which can be optimized using training data. Since this is the first year in which the current collection is being used, such training data is unavailable. We therefore use the standard value of 0.15, as described by Hiemstra and Kraaij <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.02,428.63,10.58,8.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lemur</head><p>We also include Lemur's KL-divergence language model based retrieval method in our evaluations. Within that method, documents are ranked according to the negative of the divergence of the query language model from the document language model. We select interpolated Jelinek-Mercer smoothing and set document λ to 0.15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Indri</head><p>The default retrieval method in Indri is based on the combination of inference networks with language modeling, using Dirichlet smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.00,615.79,10.58,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Thus, documents are ranked according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="2,369.27,650.55,182.77,22.55">P(t|d) = t f (t, d) + µP(t|D) |d| + µ , (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="2,552.04,657.29,3.87,8.97">)</formula><p>where µ is a free parameter to determine the amount of smoothing. We only use the #combine operator and set µ to its default value of 1500.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Lucene</head><p>We also include results of Lucene's off-the-shelf retrieval model, i.e., for a collection D, document d and query q:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="3,81.40,106.80,183.91,39.25">sim(q, d) = ∑ t∈q tf t,q • idf t norm q • tf t,d • idf t norm d • coord q,d • weight t ,</formula><p>where tf t,X = freq(t, X),</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="3,126.00,190.75,109.43,22.54">idf t = 1 + log |D| freq(t, D)</formula><p>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="3,106.22,217.88,122.31,70.24">norm q = ∑ t∈q tf t,q • idf t 2 , norm d = |d|, coord q,d = |q ∩ d| |q| .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Query Expansion</head><p>The fact that there are frequently occuring spelling variations and synonyms for any given biomedical concept, degrades the performance of regular adhoc IR techniques. To overcome this problem, we propose different forms of collectionspecific and online query expansion methods, based on the hypothesis that proper handling of synonymous terms is essential in biomedical text retrieval. The methods we propose include using acronyms and their corresponding long forms from the collection, the matching of related long forms, and the online lookup of unknown query terms and gene names.</p><p>As is common with using query expansion in general, one is likely to improve recall at the cost of precision <ref type="bibr" coords="3,257.99,472.51,15.77,8.97" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,277.13,472.51,11.83,8.97" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Some of the added synonyms, acronyms, or long forms for a particular query term might be identical to other biomedical concepts (e.g., diseases or methods, where the query term is a gene name). Including all possible expansions in the query will therefore result in higher recall but also in more noise.</p><p>Our intuition is that the high-precision approach to passage identification, by indexing individual sentences as pseudodocuments as described in Section 2.2, would compensate for any query drift.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Query Preprocessing</head><p>We use the Genia parser <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.82,626.82,10.79,8.97" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,173.59,626.82,13.28,8.97" target="#b10">11]</ref> to syntactically parse the topics and extract all noun phrases (NPs) and headwords, thus identifying all relevant aspects from the query <ref type="bibr" coords="3,261.94,650.73,10.58,8.97" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. All topics follow a certain topic template, so each contains one or more biological concepts and processes and some explicit relationship between them. We identify the biological subject(s) and object(s) of the query and discard the relationship term(s).</p><p>The resulting query aspects are kept as phrases for subsequent query expansion, since phrases are reported to improve retrieval results when compared to single-word indexing <ref type="bibr" coords="3,332.56,92.82,15.77,8.97" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.48,92.82,11.83,8.97" target="#b14">15]</ref>. We believe this is also the case in biomedical IR. Finally, we apply the breakpoint algorithm, as introduced by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,383.42,116.73,10.58,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, to the query aspects. In the following sections we elaborate on our query expansion strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Corpus-Specific Acronym Identification</head><p>We mine acronyms and their corresponding forms directly from the documents in the collection, using the algorithm described by Schwartz and Hearst <ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.62,199.67,15.27,8.97" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We adapted their approach in order to also collect frequency information. All found acronyms, long forms and frequencies were stored in a database, with an acronym being defined as a term with a maximum length of 6 characters and containing at least one uppercase character. For every query aspect, we check whether it is an acronym, and proceed with different approaches, depending on whether the term is indeed an acronym.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Acronyms</head><p>If the term is indeed an acronym, we look up all possible long forms in the database and add all results with a frequency of more than 1 to the query.</p><p>In addition, we also look up alternative acronyms for a given acronym. These are identified as follows: A list was made for all long forms of every acronym. The most frequent long form with a different acronym is identified and the acronym is selected for addition to the query. For example, the most commonly used long form for the term PrnP is "prion protein gene." The most commonly used acronym for this long form is not PrnP, but prp. We hesitated to put the alternative longer form in the query as well, but chose not to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Long Forms</head><p>If the NP is not an acronym, we check whether it has one or more acronyms. Again, all resulting acronyms with a frequency greater than 1 are added to the query.</p><p>Acronyms related to a given long form are also searched for in the database. For all long forms we check if they occur as a substring in other long forms. If so, these related long forms, together with their most frequent acronym, were returned. As an example "Alzheimer's disease" produces "fad" and "Familiar Alzheimer's disease" as related acronym and long form respectively.</p><p>Finally, for long forms which don't have a long form in the database, we turn to Google. These long forms were submitted to the search engine, prefixed with the define operator, and acronyms that occurred more than once in the snippets returned were used as query expansion terms, together with their long forms. This helped us, for example, to find the acronym BSE for "mad cow disease" and PCD for "apoptosis."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Breakpoints</head><p>We also applied the earlier mentioned breakpoint algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,53.80,358.70,11.62,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to the found expansion terms. To limit needlessly long queries, we filter the generated morphological variants based on the terms in the index-only if a particular variant occurs in the collection does it get added to the query. For example: "Prn-P" "Prn P" "Pr P" "Pr-P" are breakpoint alternatives for "PrnP" but none are selected for addition because none of these occur in the collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Gene Name Expansion</head><p>For Gene names we propose a different algorithm. A gene name is defined as a long form or an NP that ends in "gene[s]". It turns out that all identified acronyms that don't have an entry in the database are indeed gene names. We look these up on BioInformatics.org<ref type="foot" coords="4,204.26,526.31,3.69,6.63" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and again mine the output for (synonymous) acronyms. All those that start with a bracket or a digit are discarded; the resulting ones are added to the query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Runs</head><p>To get some idea of the relative performance of various retrieval models, we evaluate a baseline run using Lucene, Lemur, Indri, and Lucene with a language modeling extension. Due to time constraints however, we could not evaluate the query expansion methods from Section 4 with every retrieval model. These were only evaluated using Lucene with the language modeling extension, as described in Section 3.1. Also, we were unable to index sentences as pseudodocuments with Indri/Lemur. We did apply Porter's stemming algorithm with Indri/Lemur.</p><p>Using the above mentioned models and indexes, we evaluate the following runs:</p><p>baseline A baseline run, using only the extracted noun phrases from the original topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UAmsBaseLine</head><p>The same as baseline, with breakpoint variant generation, collection-specific acronym, and long-form expansion.</p><p>UAmsExp Same as UAmsBaseLine, with additional query expansion: substring matching, gene name expansion, alternative acronyms, and Google define.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,341.10,507.27,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_1">1</ref> displays the results of all evaluated runs (best scores per metric in boldface). Looking at the baseline runs, we first note that stemming improves document retrieval effectiveness by more than 10%. The KL-divergence method, as implemented in Lemur, is able to outperform any other retrieval method on the document-level, using mostly default settings. Lucene, when used out-of-the-box, has the lowest performance scores when taking only document-level assessments into account. It is however able to achieve the highest passage-level scores, closely followed by Lucene with the language modeling extension. It is too early to dismiss our intuition that the highprecision approach to passage identification will improve average precision scores. With the current results, it seems that indexing sentences instead of entire paragraphs as pseudodocuments boosts passage-level scores, while at the same time keeping document-level scores at a reasonable level. Expanding the queries using the proposed algorithms has mixed effects on retrieval effectiveness. They do certainly not succeed in outperforming the already strong baseline.</p><p>When zooming in on the individual document scores, there are three distinct peaks for topics 160, 163, and 181. These topics contain "mad cow disease," "Alzheimer's disease," and "colon cancer," respectively. As indicated earlier in Section 4.4, the use of a generic web search engine helps us to find the proper acronym for "mad cow disease," and substring matching helps us to find the more common long form for "Alzheimer's disease," namely "familial Alzheimer's disease," together with its acronym FAD.</p><p>We did not pursue any specific goal regarding aspect retrieval. However, the aspect scores indicate that stemming helps, whereas indexing documents at the sentence level certainly does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We have described our participation in the TREC 2006 Genomics track. Our aim this year was to apply query expansion techniques in order to find synonymous terms. First off, we used a POS tagger to identify noun phrases (or aspects) in the topics. Next, the identified query aspects were expanded using various query expansion strategies, based on collection-specific as well as online algorithms. The application of these methods however, degraded the strong baseline. We do still believe that proper handling of synonymous terms is essential and might further improve the retrieval scores and we plan to experiment with weighing various expansion terms to smooth the effect of adding new terms to the original query.</p><p>We used sentence boundaries within the original source documents as our passage boundaries, under the assumption that this would yield results with relatively high precision scores. While this certainly seems to boost passage-level effectiveness, there is room for improvement, e.g., by merging highscoring consecutive sentences. Future experiments will also include building and evaluating a sentence-level index in Indri/Lemur.
