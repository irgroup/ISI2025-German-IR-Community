The following features were produced for abstract, entities, title, and venue: average idf, average tfidf, average saturation term, average BM25, where saturation term is the function of term frequency that multiplies the IDF of the BM25 weight. To reduce the high variability, the logarithm function was applied to average idf, average tfidf, and average BM25. Moreover, the number of authors per author group was produced. Finally, the relevance assessment, the number of in-citations, the number of out-citations, and the number of query terms was added to each output record.</p><p>The aforementioned feature file was processed to compute the proportion of authors for each relevance assessment and for each author group, that is:</p><p>) where j is the author group and f ,i is the number of documents authored by authors of group i and assigned the relevance assessment = 0, 1.</p></div>
