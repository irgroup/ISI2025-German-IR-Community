<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Precision medicine is a medical paradigm in which treatments are customized entirely to the individual patient. The underlying issue that drives precision medicine is that for many complex diseases, there are no "one size fits all" solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is thus the hallmark of the emerging precision medicine paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely focused at the moment than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient's tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative <ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.53,621.16,118.90,8.74" target="#b0">(Collins and Varmus, 2015)</ref> launched by President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program.</p><p>A fundamental difficulty with putting the findings of precision medicine into practice is that-by its very nature-precision medicine creates a very large space of treatment options <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.42,657.02,79.55,8.74" target="#b1">(Frey et al., 2016)</ref>. These can easily overwhelm clinicians attempting to stay up-to-date with the latest findings, and can easily inhibit a clinician's attempts to determine the best possible treatment for a particular patient. However, the ability to quickly locate relevant evidence is the hallmark of information retrieval (IR).</p><p>For three consecutive years the TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track sought to evaluate IR systems that provide medical evidence at the point-of-care. The TREC Precision Medicine track, then, was launched to specialize the CDS track to the needs of precision medicine so IR systems can focus on this important issue. The Precision Medicine track has focused on a single field, oncology, for a specific use case, genetic mutations of cancer. This started with the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track, continued in 2018, and further continues with the 2019 track described here. As described above, main idea behind precision medicine is to use detailed patient information (largely genomic information in most current research) to identify the most effective treatments. Improving patient care in precision oncology then requires both (a) a mechanism to locate the latest research relevant to a patient, and (b) a fallback mechanism to locate the most relevant clinical trials when the latest techniques prove ineffective for a patient. In the first part, the track continues the previous Clinical Decision Support track (with a more focused use case), while in the second part expands the task to cover a new type of data (clinical trial descriptions). The main change between the 2017-2018 tracks and the 2019 track was to add the optional sub-task of determining the actual treatments described in literature articles (no changes were made for trials, where this data is more clearly available in semi-structured form). The idea behind this addition was to allow for an aspect-based retrieval approach, where results can be grouped by the actual treatments described for easier presentation for oncologists. The remainder of this overview is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the historical context of medical IR evaluation that led to the Precision Medicine track; Section 3 describes the structure of the topics and the process of creating them; Section 4 outlines the retrieval tasks; Section 5 describes the evaluation method; finally, Section 6 details the results of the participant systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>The TREC Precision Medicine track continues a long tradition of biomedical retrieval evaluations within TREC. This started with the 2003-2007 TREC Genomics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.07,350.10,122.40,8.74" target="#b2">(Hersh and Voorhees, 2009)</ref> tracks, intended to connect genomics researchers to relevant biomedical literature. This was followed by the 2011 and 2012 TREC Medical Records tracks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.17,374.01,119.71,8.74" target="#b8">(Voorhees and Hersh, 2012)</ref>, focusing on retreiving cohorts of patients from electronic health records. The 2014-2016 TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track <ref type="bibr" coords="2,451.71,385.96,85.99,8.74" target="#b7">(Roberts et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,73.99,397.92,37.08,8.74">(Roberts et al., , 2016a,b) ,b)</ref> targeted giving clinicians access to evidence-based literature. Then, the TREC Precision Medicine track grew from the CDS track, starting in 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.43,409.88,91.59,8.74" target="#b5">(Roberts et al., 2017)</ref> and continuing in 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,477.13,409.88,65.10,8.74;2,73.99,421.83,22.14,8.74" target="#b4">(Roberts et al., 2018)</ref>, focusing on a more narrow problem domain (precision oncology). The 2019 Precision Medicine track continues this effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Topics</head><p>The 2019 Precision Medicine track provided 40 topics. Due to the difficulty in obtaining actual patient data, the topics were synthetically created, though often inspired by actual patients, with modification.<ref type="foot" coords="2,512.98,498.93,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Out of the 40 total topics, 30 were created by oncologists from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The other 10 topics, unrelated to cancer, were based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommendations.<ref type="foot" coords="2,257.62,534.80,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> These topics were added to assess the relative difficulty of cancer search versus other disciplines requiring precision medicine.</p><p>The topics contain three key elements in a semi-structured format to reduce the need to perform natural language processing to identify the key elements. The three key elements are: (1) disease (e.g., type of cancer), (2) genetic variants (primarily the genetic variants in the tumors themselves as opposed to the patient's DNA), and (3) demographic information (e.g., age, sex), Four topics from the track are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,101.73,608.10,3.87,8.74">1</ref>. Note that the final example in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,280.30,608.10,4.98,8.74">1</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Tasks</head><p>The two tasks in the Precision Medicine track correspond to two different corpora, each with different goals (underlined):</p><p>1. Literature Articles. Because precision medicine is a fast-moving field, keeping up-to-date with the latest literature can be challenging due to both the volume and velocity of scientific advances. Therefore, when treating patients, it would be helpful to present the most relevant scientific articles for an individual patient. The primary literature corpus is therefore a snapshot of MEDLINE abstracts (i.e., what is searchable through the PubMed interface). Relevant literature articles can guide precision oncologists to the best-known treatment options for the patient's condition. The treatment options are represented simply as the article abstract, participants do not need to provide a specific treatment name, simply an article describing a potential treatment. An updated snapshot was used for the 2019 track (both the 2017 and 2018 tracks used the same snapshot of 26.76 million abstracts). Specifically, this corpus is composed of 29,138,916 MEDLINE abstracts. Unlike 2017 and 2018, the ASCO and AACR abstracts were not included.</p><p>• Treatment Sub-Task: Participants were given the option of also providing up to three treatments described in the article. In order to be valid, a treatment must be evaluated within the scope of the article (e.g., a treatment that is mentioned but whose efficacy is not evaluated is not relevant). For simplicity, treatments were provided simply as strings (as opposed to, say, UMLS CUIs). The basic idea behind this sub-task is to allow search engines to organize results in a treatment-oriented manner, as opposed to a simple ranked list of articles. For instance, a search engine that returns results for two separate treatment options may be more useful than a search engine returning only articles relating to the most well-known treatment.</p><p>2. Clinical Trials. In many oncology patients, no approved treatment is available (or, commonly, none of the available treatments have proven effective). The common recourse in this case is to determine if any potential treatments are undergoing evaluation in a clinical trial. Therefore, in such situations, it would be helpful to automatically identify the most relevant clinical trials for an individual patient. Precision oncology trials typically use a certain treatment (e.g., a form of chemotherapy or radiation) for a certain disease with a specific genetic variant (or set of variants). Such trials can have complex inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that are challenging to match with automated systems <ref type="bibr" coords="4,486.78,219.35,55.46,8.74;4,98.90,231.31,22.14,8.74" target="#b9">(Weng et al., 2011)</ref>. The corpus is derived from ClinicalTrials.gov, a repository of past, present, and future clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad. A total of 241,006 clinical trial descriptions compose the corpus provided to participants. Note that for the purposes of this track, the state of the trial (e.g., recruiting, active, completed) and geographic location constraints are not considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation followed standard TREC evaluation procedures for ad hoc retrieval tasks. Participants submitted (in trec eval format) a maximum of five automatic or manual runs per task, each consisting of a ranked list of up to 1,000 literature article IDs and 1,000 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers per topic. That is, up to 10 total runs: a maximum of 5 literature runs and 5 clinical trial runs per topic. For teams participating in the optional treatment track, these could be provided as optional strings at the end of the line.</p><p>The highest ranked articles and trials for each topic were pooled and judged by physician graduate students at OHSU and other biomedical subject matter experts.</p><p>As in the 2017 and 2018 Precision Medicine tracks, the assessment process was two-tiered: first a manual assessment was made by the human assessors based on several categories for each result (referred to here as Result Assessment), then a relevance score was assigned to the result based on its categorization (referred to here as Relevance Assessment). Treatment evaluation primarily occurred during the result assessment step, where assessors were provided with a checkbox for each treatment string provided by the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Result Assessment</head><p>Result assessment can be viewed as a set of multi-class annotations. Judging an individual result, whether an article or trial, proceeds in a cascaded manner with two steps: an initial pass ensures the article/trial is broadly relevant to precision medicine, after which the assessor categorizes the article/trial according to the three fields above.</p><p>See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,136.97,547.32,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for a flow chart style overview of this process. The first step is designed to save assessor time by filtering out unrelated articles/trials, since the second step can be more time-consuming (possibly requiring a more detailed reading of the article/trial). The assessors were free to quickly skim the article/trial in order to make the initial decision. Then, if the article/trial is relevant to precision medicine (by the standard outlined below), a more detailed reading may be necessary in order to accurately assess all fields.</p><p>The first step is to determine whether the article/trial is related to precision medicine. There are three options:</p><p>• Human PM: The article/trial (1) relates to humans, (2) involves some form of cancer, (3) focuses on treatment, prevention, or prognosis of cancer, and (4) relates in some way to at least one of the genes in the topic. • Animal PM: Identical to Human PM requirements (2)-( <ref type="formula" coords="4,350.58,679.03,3.94,8.74">4</ref>), except for animal research.</p><p>• Not PM: Everything else. This includes "basic science" that focuses on understanding underlying genomic principles (e.g., pathways), but provides no evidence for treatment. The second step is to determine the appropriate categorization for each of the three fields:</p><p>1. Disease:</p><p>• Exact: The form of cancer in the article/trial is identical to the one in the topic.</p><p>• More General: The form of cancer in the article/trial is more general than the one in the topic (e.g., blood cancer vs. leukemia). • More Specific: The form of cancer in the article/trial is more specific than the one in the topic (e.g., squamous cell lung carcinoma vs. lung cancer). • Not Disease: The article/trial is not about a disease, or is about a different disease (or type of cancer) than the one in the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Gene [for each particular gene in the topic]</head><p>• Exact: The article/trial focuses on the exact gene and variant as the one in the topic. If the topic does not contain a specific variant, then this holds as long as the gene is included. By "focus" this means the gene/variant needs to be part of the scientific experiment of the article/trial, as opposed to discussing related work. • Missing Gene: The article/trial does not focus the particular gene in the topic. If the gene is referenced but not part of the study, then it is considered missing. • Missing Variant: The article/trial focuses on the particular gene in the topic, but not the particular variant in the topic. If no variant is provided in the topic, this category should not be assigned. • Different Variant: The article/trial focuses on the particular gene in the topic, but on a different variant than the one in the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Demographic</head><p>• Matches: The article/trial demographic population matches the one in the topic.</p><p>• Excludes: The article/trial demographic population specifically excludes the one in the topic.</p><p>• Not Discussed: The article/trial does not discuss a particular demographic population.</p><p>Note that in the 2017 track, an "Other" field was used as well. This was dropped for 2018 and 2019 because several oncology experts felt it is not a major part of precision medicine decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Relevance Assessment</head><p>Relevance assessment is defined here as the process of mapping the multi-class result assessments described above onto a single numeric relevance scale. This allows for the computation of evaluation metrics (e.g., infNDCG, R-prec, P@10) as well as the tuning of IR systems to improve their search ranking. As already demonstrated by the need for result assessment above, for the Precision Medicine track the notion of relevance assessment becomes more complex than previous tracks.</p><p>One of the factors that makes precision medicine a difficult domain for IR is that different patient cases require different types of flexibility on the above categories. For some patients, the exact type of cancer is not relevant. Other times, the patient's demographics factors might weigh more heavily. Most notably, the very concept of precision medicine acknowledges the uniqueness of the patient, and so it is to be expected that no perfect match is found. Not only do the topics provided to the participants not contain the necessary information to decide what factors are more/less relevant (e.g., the patient's previous treatments), in many ways it isn't realistic to assign the IR system this responsibility. Precision medicine requires a significant amount of oversight by clinicians, including the ability to consider multiple treatment options. So it might ultimately make the most sense to allow the relevance assessment to be, at least in part, designed by the clinician to allow the IR system to adjust its rankings to suit. Given the constraints of an IR shared task, however, it is necessary to define a relevance assessment process. As such, a fairly broad notion of relevance based on the above categories was used:</p><p>1. Definitely Relevant: The result should: be either Human PM or Animal PM; have a Disease assignment of Exact or More Specific; have at least one Gene is Exact; the Demographic is either Exact or Not Discussed.</p><p>2. Partially Relevant: Largely the same as Definitely Relevant, but with the exception that Disease can also be More General and Gene can also be Missing Variant or Different Variant.</p><p>3. Not Relevant: Neither of the above.</p><p>The primary evaluation metrics are precision at rank 10 (P@10), inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG), and R-precision (R-prec). For infNDCG, Definitely Relevant has a score of 2, Partially Relevant is 1, and Not Relevant is 0. In 2017, clinical trials were pooled using a different sampling strategy than literature articles, and therefore had different primary evaluation metrics (P@5, P@10, P@15). However, starting in the 2018 track and continuing into 2019 the same sampling strategy was used for both tasks and therefore the same primary evaluation metrics apply.</p><p>For treatment evaluation, two metrics were used: Treatment Recall@N and Treatment F1@N. For both of these, the unique, valid treatments returned in the top N results were considered relative to the total number of validated treatments from all pooled runs. This intentionally penalizes results that only return a handful of treatments in the top results. This penalty is inspired by the many knowledge-based approaches to this task in the past, where one way to improve overall retrieval results is to identify a priori the standard treatments for a given situation (e.g., breast cancer patient with HER2 mutation), then focus on retrieving articles with this treatment (e.g., using query expansion). This situation is not necessarily ideal for oncologists, who often must consider multiple potential treatments. Thus, systems that present a diversity of treatment options to the user may be preferable over a standard relevance-ranked list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>In total, there were 22,429 judgments for the literature articles and 14,188 judgments for the clinical trials.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>The goal of the Precison Medicine track is to inform the creation of information retrieval systems to support clinicians working in precision medicine (specifically oncologists in this track) in making better treatment decisions for individual patients. Participants were provided with synthetic patient data consisting of a type of cancer, one or more genetic variants, and patient demographics. Given this, participants were challenged with retrieving relevant treatments (in the form of literature articles) and relevant trials (in the form of clinical trial descriptions) for the specific patient.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,209.82,177.25,196.59,8.74;5,167.64,65.03,280.95,97.11"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Two-step result assessment process</figDesc><graphic coords="5,167.64,65.03,280.95,97.11" type="bitmap" /></figure>
