<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The quality of articles in Wikipedia greatly depends on the level of editorial effort that is deployed to maintain them. In an ideal world, every document that requires editing would get the attention needed by Wikipedia editors to improve its quality. Unfortunately, the demand for editorial effort is substantially higher than the available editorial resources.</p><p>To meet this limitation, Wikipedia coordinators/editors use search engines to find the Wikipedia documents that will be edited. Articles and topics in Wikipedia have different characteristics in terms of protected attributes. If the search engines used in the editorial process do not consider these attributes, different societal groups may receive disparate outcomes, eventually leading to negative social and economic impact.</p><p>The Fair Ranking Track at TREC 2022 aims to address the problem of providing fair rankings of Wikipedia articles for coordinators/editors. This report describes the participation of the RMIT CIDDA IR group in Task 1 of the track, which consists of providing a fair ranking of Wikipedia articles when multiple protected attributes need to be considered. We addressed this challenge by proposing a three-stage approach that includes ad hoc retrieval, explicit Search Results Diversification (SRD), and ranking fusion. We also explored the use of a multi-criteria decision-making method (Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP) as a mechanism to allow stakeholders to have control of the way that different attributes could be combined in the fusion stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">TASK 1: FAIR RANKINGS TO SUPPORT WIKIPROJECT COORDINATORS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Goal</head><p>The goal of Task 1 at the Fair Ranking Track at TREC 2022 2 is to support WikiProject coordinators in producing a ranked list of articles that editors can then consult when looking for work to do. Given a query (i.e., keywords in a WikiProject title) the system needs to produce a single ranking consisting of 500 articles retrieved from a collection of Wikimedia articles (a dump of the English Wikipedia). The quality of systems is evaluated in two dimensions: relevance, based on relevance assessments for the articles derived from Wikipedia data; and fairness, based on the exposure of a set of fairness/protected attributes associated with the articles, listed in Section 2.2. languages: The number of other Wikipedia language articles that the article is replicated in, mapped to three discrete categories: English-only, 2-4 languages, and 5+ languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fairness/Protected Attributes</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation Measures</head><p>Three official evaluation measures were used in the task: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain nDCG <ref type="bibr" coords="2,514.15,458.05,10.68,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for relevance, Attention-Weighted Rank Fairness (AWRF) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,309.77,471.75,14.85,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for fairness, and Score, which is the product of nDCG and AWRF. Both nDCG and AWRF are computed using a logarithmic decay function. For all measures, higher scores indicate better performance. Rankings are truncated at depth 500.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">APPROACH</head><p>Our approach consists of three stages: ad hoc retrieval to produce an initial ranking (Section 3.1); a re-ranking stage based on SRD (Section 3.2); and a final ranking fusion stage to generate the final ranking (Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Initial Ranking: Ad Hoc Retrieval</head><p>The first stage consists of retrieving Wikipedia articles given a WikiProject topic. We used the keywords field of the topic (i.e., the parsed title provided by the organizers). To index the collection, we used the plain collection, i.e., the full article text, without Wiki markup (plain file only). Retrieval was carried out using the Pyserini [9] implementation of Okapi BM25 with default parameters (𝑘1 = 0.9, 𝑏 = 0.4). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Re-ranking: Search Result Diversification</head><p>We are interested in understanding the relation between SRD and fairness-aware rankings <ref type="bibr" coords="3,413.09,281.06,15.47,7.94" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,431.31,281.06,10.20,7.94" target="#b11">12]</ref>. In the fairness scenario proposed for Task 1 of the Fair Ranking Track at TREC 2022, fairness/protected attributes are known -in contrast to the TREC 2021 Fair Ranking Track <ref type="bibr" coords="3,241.32,308.46,9.28,7.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which had one of the attributes hidden from the participants. Hence, the problem can be addressed as an SRD problem. In this edition, we wanted to understand to what extent SRD methods can be used to diversify a ranking given a protected/fairness attribute. Given a fairness attribute, values for that particular attribute are treated as aspects or sub-topics, aligned with literature on SRD [2, 3,</p><p>As we are interested in considering statistical parity to diversify our ranking, we decided to explore a proportionalitybased SRD method, i.e., the PM-2 model proposed by Dang and Croft <ref type="bibr" coords="3,325.69,376.95,9.39,7.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with 𝛼 = 0.5.</p><p>PM-2 is applied for each of the 11 fairness categories listed in Section 2.2. We use PM-2 (attribute) to denote the diversification obtained using each attribute when reporting our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Final Ranking: Ranking Fusion</head><p>As the task includes multiple fairness/protected attributes, we obtain a set of 11 diversified rankings as the output of the (previous) re-ranking stage. In the final stage, ranking fusion is used to combine the diversified rankings and obtain the final ranking (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,210.88,473.04,2.94,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We used the polyfuse<ref type="foot" coords="3,166.44,484.59,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_0">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.56,486.74,10.57,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> implementation of Reciprocal Ranking Fusion (RRF) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,374.22,486.74,11.07,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to fuse the diversified rankings.</p><p>Given the initial ranking 𝑅, the final ranking 𝐿 is obtained by applying RRF to the 11 diversified rankings obtained with PM-2: 𝐿 = RRF (PM-2(𝑅, topic_countries), PM-2(𝑅, topic_regions), . . . , PM-2(𝑅, languages))</p><p>(1)</p><p>Analytic Hierarchic Process. Equation 1 assumes that all protected attributes have the same importance (or weight) when fusing the rankings. However, some fairness attributes may be more important than others and different stakeholders (e.g., WikiProject coordinators) may have different ways of modeling those priorities w.r.t. different fairness/protected attributes. In this section, we aim to explore a mechanism to allow stakeholders to weight different attributes to our ranking pipeline.</p><p>In operational research, a number of multi-criteria decision-making methods have been proposed <ref type="bibr" coords="3,439.05,617.08,13.31,7.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We opted to explore the feasibility (and sensitivity) of using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) by Saaty <ref type="bibr" coords="3,401.86,630.78,14.72,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to enable our weighted reciprocal ranking fusion. AHP provides a mechanism that allows stakeholders to define a weighting schema for complex criteria by defining pairwise importance relationships, where higher weights imply higher relative importance. The application of AHP spans across multiple areas, including education, manufacturing, politics, and engineering, among others <ref type="bibr" coords="4,135.67,140.24,13.43,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For instance, AHP had been used for evaluating journal quality by consolidating multiple criteria related to the quality of a journal into an integrated measure <ref type="bibr" coords="4,308.73,153.94,9.47,7.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply AHP in fairness-aware rankings.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,142.95,181.34,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows an example of the input for AHP applied to our scenario. By checking the consistency across the relationships, an iterative method produces a weighting schema that adheres to the constrains/relationships defined by the stakeholder. In our runs, 14 different weighting schemas were obtained by arbitrarily defining consistent relationships across the 11 fairness/protected attributes. In our results, we denote these variations with AHP 1 ,. . ., AHP 14 . <ref type="foot" coords="5,412.88,110.53,2.87,5.47" target="#foot_1">4</ref> Table 2 lists the weighting schemas obtained for our experiments. The second row (AHP 1 ) corresponds to the weighting schema obtained for the relationships defined in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,127.77,137.13,2.73,7.13" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Weighted Reciprocal Ranking Fusion. We adapted RRF <ref type="bibr" coords="5,250.24,155.98,9.43,7.13" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to accept weights for the rankings to be fused. The score of the document in the final ranking is a linear combination of the reciprocal ranks. Hereafter, we use wRRF to refer to this variant. Given the set of documents 𝐷 in the 𝑛 rankings to be fused R = {𝑅 1 , . . . , 𝑅 𝑛 }, the weights corresponding for those rankings 𝑊 = {𝑤 1 , . . . , 𝑤 𝑛 }, and 𝑘 = 60:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,195.37,212.88,306.95,18.70">wRRF(𝑑 ∈ 𝐷 ) = 𝑤 1 • 1 𝑘 + 𝑅 1 (𝑑 ) + . . . + 𝑤 𝑛 • 1 𝑘 + 𝑅 𝑛 (𝑑 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We used wRRF (Equation <ref type="formula" coords="5,168.60,234.65,3.05,7.13" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) to fuse the diversified rankings taking into account the weights produced by AHP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>In this section we report the results obtained in the training topics (Section 5.1) and the results of the 8 submitted runs submitted in the evaluation topics (Section 5.2). For statistical significance, we performed Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test to correct for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results for Training Topics</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,92.14,611.37,3.63,7.13">3</ref> shows the results for the training topics. The table includes the scores for the three stages of our proposed pipeline. Compared  According to Tukey's HSD test, the following differences are statistically significant (𝑝 &lt; 0.05). Diversifying with languages is significantly worse than the initial ranking BM25 and than the diversified run using gender. The difference between these two diversified rankings is also statistically significant for the Score results. In terms of AWRF, the scores obtained by BM25 + PM-2 (gender) are statistically significantly better than all the other runs besides BM25 + PM-2 (all) + wRRF (AHP 9 ).</p><p>In this work we explored the relation between fairness-aware rankings and SRD in the context of multiple fairness/protected attributes.</p><p>Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), a competitive ranking fusion method, was used to combine the multiple diversified rankings. We also explored the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making method, to simulate a human-in-the-loop fusion stage, where stakeholders could have control on how to weight different fairness attributes. The results demonstrated little sensitivity, suggesting that the way we incorporated diversification and fusion have little impact on the way the initial ranking in the ad hoc retrieval stage is modified.</p><p>These initial experiments have a number of limitations that we plan to address in future work. First, each stage of the pipeline was only instantiated with one method. Although they are all competitive in terms for the three stages (i.e., ad hoc retrieval, diversification, and ranking fusion), a more comprehensive study with other methods is needed. Moreover, we believe it is worth analyzing supervised versions of our approach (e.g., learning the weights for ranking fusion). Finally, we plan to explore ways of embedding multi-criteria decision-making methods at earlier stages of the pipeline (e.g., to inform the hierarchical diversification), in the hope of finding more effective ways of enabling stakeholders to control the way multiple fairness attributes should be combined to generate fair rankings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,109.73,158.33,329.97,7.94;2,127.33,179.70,326.96,7.94;2,127.33,193.39,371.38,7.94;2,127.33,207.09,412.61,7.94;2,127.33,220.79,411.23,7.94;2,138.79,234.49,60.19,7.94;2,127.33,248.19,412.29,7.94;2,138.79,261.89,277.53,7.94;2,127.33,275.59,412.28,7.94;2,138.79,289.29,192.80,7.94;2,127.33,302.98,411.23,7.94;2,138.79,316.68,65.98,7.94;2,127.33,330.38,372.59,7.94;2,127.33,344.08,412.28,7.94;2,138.79,357.78,183.43,7.94;2,127.33,371.48,412.22,7.94;2,138.79,385.18,358.05,7.94"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Wikipedia articles in the collection are characterized with 11 fairness/protected attributes: topic_countries: The geographical location (countries) associated with the article topic. topic_regions: The geographical location (sub-continental regions) associated with the article topic. sources_countries: The geographical location (countries) associated with the article based on the article's sources. sources_regions: The geographical location (sub-continental regions) associated with the article based on the article's sources. gender: The gender of the individual about whom the biography pertains, mapped into four distinct categories: Man, Woman, Non-binary, and Unknown (missing data or not a biography). topic_age: Age of the topic: how old the subject of the article is (in years), mapped to four distinct categories: Unknown, Pre-1900s, 20th century, and 21st century. occupations: The occupation of the subject of an article.

Results for the runs tested using the training topics and the official evaluation measures for relevance (nDCG), fairness (AWRF), and both (Score, i.e., the product of nDCG and AWRF.

Varying the input to AHP (i.e., simulating different stakeholders indicating different weights for the fairness attributes) does not seem to have a substantial impact on the fusion.</p><p>According to Tukey's HSD test, only the diversified ranking using the gender attribute (Row 5, rmit_cidda_ir_5) has statistically significant differences (with 𝑝-value &lt; 0.05) w.r.t. the diversified rankings obtained with the pageviews and topic_countries attributes (Rows 8 and 10), for the three metrics.

In terms of relevance, any further manipulation of the ranking obtained by BM25 results in lower effectiveness scores (refer Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,357.18,609.00,2.58,7.13">2</ref>). In terms of fairness, we observe the opposite, as both re-ranking and fusion increase AWRF scores. The run diversifying using the gender attribute obtains the highest fairness scores and the best trade-off between relevance and fairness. Also, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,314.56,633.91,3.69,7.13">2</ref> compares our submitted runs against the best submission at Task 1 of TREC 2022 Fair Ranking Track, where the best submission is the run with the highest Score (i.e., the product of nDCG and AWRF).</p></div>			</div>
