<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the digital era, effective management of emergencies, such as natural disasters, requires efficient communication between management teams and various stakeholders, including the media, government agencies, and the general public. To effectively fulfill this role, management teams must have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information during the event. Additionally, these reports must be tailored to meet the needs of individuals and communities affected or potentially impacted by the disaster, who may have diverse and dispersed requirements. However, it is not feasible for a single crisis agent to be physically present at every relevant location during a disaster, such as a wildfire. In these instances, utilizing information from the general public and independent news sources can serve as a means of staying informed.</p><p>During a crisis event, the flow of crisis-related information is constant from multiple sources. Decision-makers can utilize online news sources and social media platforms to obtain up-to-date and pertinent information during the event <ref type="bibr" coords="1,95.91,699.32,82.94,6.95" target="#b29">(Saroj and Pal 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,181.36,699.32,98.98,6.95" target="#b21">Phengsuwan et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,282.84,699.32,133.49,6.95" target="#b33">Yan and Pedraza-Martinez 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.82,699.32,72.18,6.95" target="#b15">Lorini et al. 2021)</ref>. When traditional forms of communication, such as telephone lines, are overwhelmed by high volumes of simultaneous usage, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can serve as sources of information. Through these platforms, individuals can access and disseminate information about essential needs, including food, shelter, transportation, road conditions, and airport information. Social media can provide time-sensitive and relevant This study presents a method for generating comprehensive and accurate summaries of crisis events by retrieving information from social media and online news sources. Our method performs query-based multi-document summarization using the state-of-the-art NeuralSearchX search strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.41,316.27,83.87,6.95" target="#b1">(Almeida et al. 2022</ref>) to find relevant documents and using GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.10,328.23,69.28,6.95" target="#b2">(Brown et al. 2020</ref>) in a one-shot setting to summarize the top-k results. The performance of our method was evaluated on the TREC CrisisFACTS challenge dataset, using standard summarization metrics, such as Rouge-2 and BERTScore, and a manual evaluation conducted by the challenge organizers. The results show that our method performed well in both evaluations, ranking in the top 3 in the automatic evaluation and being the best in comprehensiveness in the manual evaluation. However, it displayed a high redundancy ratio in the generated summaries. An advantage of our approach is that it does not require any annotated data, making it easy to deploy the system rapidly. This is crucial for applications where the underlying data is constantly changing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>This section reviews related literature in crisis management and query-based multi-document summarization. The literature is divided into two main categories: 1) works that focus on utilizing social media summarization for crisis management and 2) works that propose methods for query-based multi-document summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Media Summarization for Crisis Management</head><p>The utilization of social media as a source of information during crisis events has gained significant attention in recent years. The real-time availability and constant flow of information from various sources make it an indispensable tool for decision-makers during these events <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.69,538.61,75.67,6.95" target="#b15">(Lorini et al. 2021)</ref>. Social media's ability to handle heavy traffic and remain functional even in the absence of electricity, unlike traditional forms of communication such as radio and television, has led to its widespread use across the globe <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.97,562.52,79.73,6.95" target="#b29">(Saroj and Pal 2020)</ref>. Nevertheless, the abundance and diverse nature of data generated from social media pose challenges for crisis management teams to extract relevant information on time <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.32,586.43,75.47,6.95" target="#b15">(Lorini et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,295.28,586.43,78.12,6.95" target="#b29">Saroj and Pal 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,375.89,586.43,91.62,6.95" target="#b21">Phengsuwan et al. 2021</ref>).</p><p>Several methods have been proposed in the literature to address the challenges of utilizing social media information in crisis management. According to Saroj and Pal 2020, most of the research in this area is centered around information extraction, summarization, and event classification techniques. These techniques aim to condense the large volume of data generated by social media into concise and meaningful summaries, which can assist crisis management teams in making informed decisions on time.</p><p>In the literature, various methods have been proposed to tackle the challenges of utilizing social media for crisis management. These methods generally involve a two-step pipeline, comprising classification and summarization, to generate useful and concise information from disaster-related social media content. For instance, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,474.56,693.70,50.45,6.95;2,72.00,705.65,19.61,6.95" target="#b8">Kedzie et al. 2015</ref> employed an unsupervised classification approach based on the prediction of the salience of documents in the context of a crisis event and integrated these predictions into a clustering-based multi-document summarization system. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.80,729.56,167.83,6.95" target="#b28">Rudra, Goyal, Ganguly, Mitra, et al. 2018</ref> proposed a method that identifies sub-events and summarizes them using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based summarization algorithm. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.87,741.52,122.66,6.95;2,72.00,753.47,43.38,6.95" target="#b27">Rudra, Goyal, Ganguly, Imran, et al. 2019</ref> presented a classification-summarization framework that assigns tweets into situational classes and then summarizes them, utilizing the AIDR classifier <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.64,765.43,74.93,6.95" target="#b7">(Imran et al. 2014)</ref> for tweet classification. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.96,765.43,68.56,6.95;3,72.00,77.50,42.74,6.95" target="#b18">Nguyen, Shaltev, et al. 2022</ref> presented CrisICSum, a platform for classifying and summarizing crisis events' tweets, utilizing the BERT2BERT model for classification into different humanitarian classes and RATSUM <ref type="bibr" coords="3,421.36,89.45,102.58,6.95">(Nguyen and Rudra 2022)</ref> for summarization.</p><p>Our proposed approach differs from previous studies by using a search engine and a language model for classification and summarization. Unlike traditional methods that employ supervised classification techniques, our approach recasts the classification step as a search problem, reducing the dependency on domain-specific annotated data. Moreover, using few-shot learning for summarization further avoids the need for extensive annotated data. Furthermore, this approach enables efficient inspection of massive document collections with sublinear computational cost, unlike the linear cost associated with classification, which limits scalability to tens of thousands of documents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OUR APPROACH</head><p>This section presents the method we propose for generating facts from social media and web news to support crisis event management. The method consists of two major steps: Document Retrieval and Aggregation, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,99.84,555.62,3.67,6.95" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The approach can be classified as query-based multi-document summarization as it summarizes text from multiple documents guided by a user query. The method assumes the availability of questions that reflect the user's information needs. The subsequent subsections provide a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the approach. Ian Soboroff and Angela Ellis, eds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Document retrieval</head><p>The document retrieval component of the proposed method is based on the NeuralSearchX engine proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,71.64,112.93,77.85,6.95" target="#b1">Almeida et al. 2022</ref>. This approach employs a two-stage pipeline consisting of (1) a bag-of-words retriever (i.e., BM25) for retrieving candidate documents and (2) a neural reranker for reranking the candidate documents. Further implementation details of these two stages are presented in subsequent subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Candidate Document Retrieval</head><p>The candidate document retrieval stage aims to identify relevant candidate documents based on the queries that reflect the user's information needs. This step is crucial to minimize the computational burden of the subsequent reranking step. A variety of search functions can be employed to accomplish this aim. In this study, we adopt the Pyserini library (Lin, X. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,173.15,224.02,58.71,6.95" target="#b13">Ma, et al. 2021</ref>) implementation of the BM25 algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,398.88,224.02,85.68,6.95" target="#b24">(Robertson et al. 1994</ref>).</p><p>For the experiment described in this work, we created an index of documents from the CrisisFACTS challenge dataset for searching purposes. However, in real-world crisis situations, the search space can be significantly larger than the one tested, especially when including news websites as sources in addition to social media. Keeping the search index updated in such cases can be challenging due to the constant flow of information. As an alternative, third-party APIs such as Bing, Google, or Twitter search can be utilized for candidate document retrieval instead.</p><p>For web search, it is necessary to assume that the snippets provided by the search engines accurately represent the content of the pages, as noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,204.26,317.79,76.59,6.95" target="#b1">Almeida et al. 2022</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Document Reranking</head><p>The objective of the reranking stage is to prioritize the relevance of candidate documents concerning the user information needs expressed as queries. The input for this stage is a set of candidate documents obtained from diverse sources, including web news and social media. The output of this stage is a ranked list of documents deemed to be most relevant to the corresponding query.</p><p>For document reranking, we used a classifier trained to estimate the probability of each document being relevant given a question and order the documents in decreasing order according to their probabilities. Research has shown that the use of Transformers results in state-of-the-art performance in this task <ref type="bibr" coords="4,379.37,450.93,85.60,6.95" target="#b19">(Nogueira et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,467.46,450.93,57.06,6.95;4,72.00,462.88,39.27,6.95" target="#b14">Lin, Nogueira, et al. 2022</ref>). Nogueira et al. 2020, for example, proposed monoT5, an adaptation of the T5 sequence-to-sequence transformer model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.19,474.84,77.40,6.95" target="#b23">(Raffel et al. 2020)</ref> for reranking. monoT5 is a T5 finetuned to produce the words "true" or "false" whether the document is relevant or not to the query. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,403.20,486.79,5.08,6.95" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (top), the model receives as input a sequence with the document and the query, and a softmax function is applied only over the logits calculated by T5 to the tokens "true" and "false". The probability of the token "true" is the document relevance score given the question. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,155.06,522.66,5.01,6.95" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (bottom) illustrates how the model can be utilized for reranking a list of documents during inference. Each query-document pair is processed independently by the model, and a relevance score is estimated. The documents are then ordered according to their estimated relevance scores. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aggregation</head><p>As previously noted, the present method is a multi-document, query-based summarization system that aims to provide a condensed response to a question through information extracted from multiple documents. Recent studies have demonstrated that using Large Language Models (LLMs) as few-shot in-context learners for question answering is an effective and cost-efficient strategy, as it only requires a small number of labeled training examples <ref type="bibr" coords="5,491.68,132.28,31.60,6.95;5,72.00,144.24,43.27,6.95" target="#b20">(Pereira et al. 2022)</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" coords="5,133.95,144.24,70.20,6.95" target="#b20">Pereira et al. 2022</ref>, state-of-the-art performance or near-state-of-the-art performance was achieved in multi-document Question Answering (QA) using GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,314.08,156.19,74.52,6.95" target="#b2">(Brown et al. 2020</ref>) as a few-shot in-context learner.</p><p>A reasoning step referred to as chain-of-thought (CoT) was utilized before answering the question, resulting in a substantial improvement in the LLMs' few-shot performance. This technique has also been shown to produce improved results in multi-document QA and in various other QA benchmarks <ref type="bibr" coords="5,384.61,192.06,66.60,6.95" target="#b31">(Wei et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,453.70,192.06,70.40,6.95" target="#b30">Wang et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,72.00,204.01,78.62,6.95" target="#b9">Kojima et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,153.42,204.01,119.96,6.95" target="#b5">Creswell and Shanahan 2022)</ref>. In this work, we adopted a similar approach to Pereira et al.</p><p>2022 by incorporating the CoT reasoning step in our summarization method. However, instead of using the final answer, we consider the reasoning paragraph generated by the model as the summary.</p><p>An example of the prompt used in our method is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,335.60,245.55,3.77,6.95" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The prompt has three main components: (1) the header, which provides instructions and explains the task to the model;</p><p>(2) the one-shot example, which includes the context documents ([Document 1]), the question, the evidence paragraph inducing the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and the final answer; and (3) the target example, which includes context documents and an associated question. The model generates the evidence paragraph and final answer to the target example when provided with the prompt. The generated evidence paragraph is used as the summary in the management report. The model cites supporting documents in the evidence paragraph, as it was instructed to do so by the one-shot example. These citations provide the manager with information about the source of information, such as publication timestamp and location, if available. In cases where insufficient information is provided in the documents, the model generates the answer "Unanswerable" as indicated by the header. In such cases, the generated summary is discarded as it may be deemed irrelevant or incorrect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Relevance</head><p>The confidence level of the generated summaries in crisis event management systems can be important in decisionmaking processes. The relevance score of each document to the user's information need query is estimated during the ranking stage of the document retrieval component. The summary relevance score is computed as the average of the relevance scores of the documents cited in the produced summary. For instance, if the relevance scores of the documents cited in the generated summary, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,337.36,453.77,3.72,6.95" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, are 0.9, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, and 0.65, respectively, then the summary relevance score is 0.75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENT</head><p>The proposed method was evaluated through an experiment submitted to the 2022 TREC CrisisFACTS Track.1</p><p>The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)2 is a conference co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Defense, focused on advancing research within the information retrieval community. TREC provides a platform for large-scale evaluations of text retrieval methodologies across various tracks, including the Crisis Facts and Cross-stream Temporal Summarization (CrisisFACTS) track, an open data challenge for evaluating summarization technologies in disaster management using online data sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset and Task Formulation</head><p>The TREC CrisisFACTS 2022 evaluation provides a multi-stream dataset related to 8 crisis events, which includes information from various online sources such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and online news (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,492.38,627.67,3.67,6.95" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The dataset is divided into daily data for each event, and the task is to generate summaries based on the information in the daily data items. The challenge requires systems to produce summaries for each event-day pair, considering only the data published on that day. The summarization of crisis content from social media is defined as a fact-extraction task by CrisisFACTS, requiring systems to generate a list of atomic facts and relevance scores indicating their significance for stakeholders.</p><p>The TREC CrisisFACTS organizers provide a set of information needs, represented by questions, extracted from FEMA ICS209 forms3. These questions are categorized based on their intent and include 46 general queries (e.g., ""Have airports closed?""), six about wildfires (e.g., ""What area has the wildfire burned?""), five specific For each example, use the documents to create an "Answer" and an "Evidence" to the "Question". Use "Unanswerable" when not enough information is provided in the documents. to hurricanes (e.g., ""What is the hurricane category?""), and two regarding flooding events (e.g., ""What flood warnings are active?"").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation Metrics</head><p>The quality of participant systems in CrisisFACTS is evaluated through two methods: 1) Summary-based evaluation, which involves comparing the generated summaries with existing event summaries from Wikipedia and official reports from the National Incident Management System, and 2) Fact-based evaluation, which involves comparing the lists of facts created by NIST assessors with the facts generated by participant systems for each event.</p><p>CrisisFACTS 2022 utilized two metrics to evaluate participant systems' performance. The first set included standard summarization metrics, including Rouge-1, Rouge-2, Rouge-L, and BERTScore <ref type="bibr" coords="6,393.70,710.48,73.41,6.95" target="#b34">(Zhang et al. 2019)</ref>. This first set of metrics compared the generated summaries with three reference summaries: 1) summaries generated by NIST assessors, 2) summaries extracted from ICS209 reports, and 3) Wikipedia articles summarizing the events.</p><p>In the second set of evaluation metrics for CrisisFACTS 2022, the focus is on fact-matching assessment. This evaluation aims to determine the volume of unique information present in the summaries. the lists of facts generated for each event-day pair are ranked by their fact importance score (𝑆 𝑑 ) and compared with the ground-truth list of facts (𝐹) to identify matches. The assessment of the matched facts is done in terms of comprehensiveness, as defined in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="7,244.02,270.59,3.71,6.95">1</ref>. Where 𝑀 ( 𝑓 , 𝑆) represents the set of facts in 𝑆 that match the fact 𝑓 , and 𝑅( 𝑓 ) is the gain assigned to the fact 𝑓 , which is set to 1 for CrisisFACTS 2022. Redundancy is also assessed by counting the number of unique facts matched divided by the total number of fact matches (cf. Equation <ref type="formula" coords="7,485.19,294.50,3.60,6.95">2</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation details</head><p>Our method for CrisisFACTS involved dividing the event-day datasets into four subsets based on the publication timestamps of the items. The items were divided into subsets: items published from 00:00 to 05:59 AM were placed in the first subset, items published from 06:00 AM to 11:59 AM were placed in the second subset, and so on. This division was performed to generate relevant facts throughout an event day and simulate a system receiving multiple requests on a single day.</p><p>A fact is generated for each query-subset pair, utilizing all provided queries to search all subsets and generate facts based on the relevant documents. The candidate documents are searched using BM25 and reranked using monoT5.4</p><p>The aggregation step involves GPT-35 with a one-shot prompt and chain-of-thought process, discarding generated facts if the model's final answer is equal to "Unanswerable". An example of a fact generated by our method is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,151.26,530.97,3.74,6.95" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summarization (automatic metrics)</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="7,106.69,593.47,3.67,6.95" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we present the results of the automatic evaluation. The automatically generated facts are compared with the ground truth facts obtained from ICS-209 reports, summaries created by NIST assessors, and Wikipedia articles summarizing the events using the BERTScore and Rouge-2 F1 measures. The results are averaged over all eight events of CrisisFACTS 2022. To calculate these scores, the organizers combined the top-𝑘 most relevant facts into a single document, representing the event summary. The value of 𝑘 is dependent on the number of facts produced by NIST assessors and varies among event-day pairs. The table shows the results of the top-3 systems, including the baseline system created by the organizers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fact Matching</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="8,95.48,525.56,4.88,6.95" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents the results of the matching metrics for the summary generation system, ordered in descending order by comprehensiveness. The table also includes other fact-matching evaluation statistics, including Assessed@k and Matching Data. Firstly, the comprehensiveness metric represents the recall of the system's generated facts concerning the ground-truth summaries. A higher value for this metric is desirable. Our system demonstrated the highest comprehensiveness among all participants, achieving a value of 34.25%, compared to 26.34% of the second-best system. This result indicates that the system's summaries covered approximately 30-35% of all facts for each event-day pair. Secondly, the redundancy ratio measures the repetition of information in a participant's summary. A lower value for this metric is preferred. Our system showed the highest redundancy ratio, implying that the generated facts for a single event-day pair tend to repeat content and information. This phenomenon can be attributed to the dataset split step, which may result in similar statements being posted during the day, which the proposed method then uses to generate similar facts.</p><p>The Assessed@k column in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,204.74,663.42,4.88,6.95" target="#tab_3">3</ref> represents a measure of confidence in the main metrics rather than a performance metric. It reports the percentage of items produced by the system that was assessed by TREC assessors for factmatching purposes. Thus, Assessed@k correlates with the level of confidence in the results. The lower this value, the greater the potential for inaccurate results due to the inclusion of irrelevant items in the assessment score A higher value is advantageous as it increases the likelihood of identifying matches when the system outputs meaningful items. The Assessed@k value of our system surpasses the average and median of the participant models.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="8,108.50,741.52,3.81,6.95" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, the Matching Data provides additional context for interpreting the results of the main metrics. The Matched % column reports the proportion of facts generated by the participant systems that have been found to match at least one gold-standard fact. Our system achieved a higher proportion of matched facts than the other  participants. The Irrelevant % column indicates the proportion of items that have been judged by the assessors to contain no relevant information. Our system had the lowest proportion of irrelevant facts among all participants. The Unmatched % column represents the proportion of facts labeled by the assessors as having potentially relevant information but did not match any gold-standard fact. Our system had a higher proportion of unmatched facts compared to the average and median of the participants. The sum of Matched % and Unmatched % yields the proportion of assessed items that were considered relevant by the assessors. In this regard, our system had 88.7% of relevant facts, while the average proportion among all participants was 55.5%.</p><p>To evaluate the density of facts within the system's output, we can compare the Matched % to the Comprehensiveness metric. A high Matched % with a low comprehensiveness value implies that the system's summary contains only a limited number of facts, which might not be sufficient. An example of this can be seen in the run of Participant 4, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,161.94,396.53,3.81,6.95" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. On the other hand, high scores for Matched % and Comprehensiveness indicate many accurate and relevant facts in the system's summary. In our run, the values for both metrics are the highest among all participants, indicating the ability of our system to generate comprehensive and accurate facts. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,502.01,420.44,3.73,6.95" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, we can also observe a precision-recall analysis, where high values for both Matched % and Comprehensiveness equate to high precision (low false positive rate) and high recall (low false negative rate), respectively. Hence, high scores in both metrics demonstrate the accuracy and completeness of the classifier's results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing Across Metrics</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,99.69,501.28,4.88,6.95" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the relationship between manual (Comprehensiveness) and automatic evaluations (Rouge-2 over the ICS-209 test set). The proximity of the data points to the overall trendline indicates a moderate-to-strong correlation between the two metrics. However, the presence of two outliers highlights that the correlation is not perfect. Our method exhibits a unique combination of high scores for Comprehensiveness and Rouge-2 over the ICS-209 test set, distinguishing it from the other runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper introduces a novel approach for generating precise and comprehensive summaries of emergency events by retrieving information from social media and online news sources. The method incorporates a cutting-edge   search strategy and utilizes GPT-3 in a one-shot setting to perform query-based multi-document summarization of social media and online news content related to crisis events. The evaluation of the proposed method on the TREC CrisisFACTS challenge dataset demonstrated its effectiveness, with high performance in standard summarization metrics and manual evaluations. Manual evaluations of the generated summaries revealed a high level of comprehensiveness, despite a relatively high redundancy ratio.</p><p>Our proposed method has the potential to provide valuable support to crisis management teams by providing them with accurate and up-to-date information during emergency situations. The advantage of this approach is its rapid deployment, as it does not require annotated data. However, further research is necessary to assess its scalability and real-time performance in actual crisis scenarios. As part of our ongoing work, we plan to investigate techniques for reducing redundancy in the retrieval component's output, to generate more comprehensive and relevant summaries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,209.88,762.41,175.53,6.43;3,72.00,607.26,451.29,141.71"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
