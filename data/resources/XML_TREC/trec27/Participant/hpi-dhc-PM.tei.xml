<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>According to the U.S. National Research Council, precision medicine aims to provide the best possible care for a patient by tailoring the treatment to its individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,285.91,445.00,10.58,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Efficient access to the existing scientific and medical literature is therefore a critical instrument to obtain treatment information related to the patient's profile. To progress in this field, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has organized the TREC Precision Medicine (TREC-PM) track since 2017.</p><p>This paper describes the participation of the "hpi-dhc" group. The team was formed by members of three different institutions with different backgrounds, including computer science and medicine. TREC-PM was held in 2018 with the same goal as the previous edition: given structured data related to an oncology patient case (henceforth denoted "topic"), retrieve relevant (1) Biomedical Abstracts (BA) from PUBMED, and (2) Clinical Trials (CT) from ClinicalTrials.gov.</p><p>The rationale behind the usage of two datasets is a cascaded search strategy. First, the existing literature is scanned for a disease and its connection to a specific genetic profile. If this search does not bring up the desired information, the patient can then potentially be enrolled on a clinical trial. The ideal precision medicine search engine would thus propose relevant literature articles first and then match clinical trials in case the former did not yield relevant results. &lt;topic number="38"&gt; &lt;disease&gt;cholangiocarcinoma&lt;/disease&gt; &lt;gene&gt;IDH1&lt;/gene&gt; &lt;demographic&gt;50-year-old male&lt;/demographic&gt; &lt;/topic&gt; Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="1,379.00,300.77,2.99,6.91">1</ref>. Example of a 2018 TREC-PM topic.</p><p>Each topic to be queried had a disease, gene and demographic component (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,426.66,342.99,3.60,8.64">1</ref>), which gave information about the type of cancer, biomarker, age and sex of the patient, respectively. The total amount of topics increased from 30 in 2017 to 50 in 2018 and, in the latter, half of them were related to melanoma. More information about the challenge, the full content of the topics, and the guidelines are available online at https://trec-cds.appspot.com/2018.html.</p><p>This paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides detailed information on the methods we applied, including a description of the experimental framework, query expansion and boosting strategies, the usage of reference standards, and rules hand-crafted for the tasks. Section III then describes specific strategies used for processing biomedical abstracts, including an Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) pipeline, the usage of Topic Modelling (TM) and Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis to discover relevant boosting keywords, and their consolidation into a Precision Medicine (PM) classifier. Subsequently, Section IV outlines the results obtained when applying the aforementioned strategies. Finally, in Section V we discuss directions for further areas of development and conclude in Section VI with a review of these results in the context of information retrieval for precision medicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. METHODS OVERVIEW A. Experimental Framework</head><p>We built our work on top of an existing Java framework proposed in 2017 by the Medical University of Graz <ref type="bibr" coords="1,548.93,666.28,10.58,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. With its aid, we indexed TREC-PM data on an Elasticsearch (ES) <ref type="foot" coords="1,330.24,688.52,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_0">1</ref> 5.4.0 instance and performed query-time experimenta- tion leveraging the ES query language. We also implemented an UIMA<ref type="foot" coords="2,89.83,231.34,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">2</ref> pipeline to preprocess biomedical abstracts, described in Section III-A. We released the code for this year's experiments at https://github.com/hpi-dhc/trec-pm. Internally produced data, submitted runs, and additional graphs are available on figshare <ref type="foot" coords="2,132.96,279.16,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>For the experiments, our first step was to add support for dynamic query decorators in the framework, which allowed on-the-fly construction of disjunction max queries (dis_max) containing synonyms and hypernyms with different weights. This enabled us to improve recall without causing a corresponding loss in precision, which was reported as a major limitation by the framework creators.</p><p>On the technical side, we also added support for subtemplates, which improved modularity and code reuse. Templates and sub-templates were created as JSON files (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,77.28,412.53,4.15,8.64" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) and helped us to compose different experiments more easily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Query Expansion</head><p>We used the framework to properly expand the disease and gene fields from the TREC-PM topics and thus improve recall. We enriched the disease with its preferred term, synonyms, and hypernyms provided by Lexigram<ref type="foot" coords="2,212.71,493.62,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , a proprietary API based on the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This allowed us to match e.g. documents mentioning "bile duct carcinoma" to the topic "cholangiocarcinoma" (see Table <ref type="table" coords="2,290.90,555.06,3.04,8.64" target="#tab_0">I</ref>). We further enriched the gene with its description and synonyms provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene list <ref type="foot" coords="2,169.84,589.26,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . For example, documents that mentioned the gene "NS7" would be correctly matched to Topic 1, whose gene is "BRAF" (see Table <ref type="table" coords="2,230.48,614.84,6.22,8.64" target="#tab_1">II</ref>).</p><p>For both the disease and gene dimensions, we gave the highest weight to the original topic term and lower weights to the preferred term, synonyms, and hypernyms (see Table <ref type="table" coords="2,284.26,650.80,9.46,8.64" target="#tab_1">III</ref>).   As a last resource, we added remaining documents with a match_all clause with negative boost. This allowed partial matches only on disease or gene and ensured that every topic had at least 1,000 results, the limit imposed by the challenge organizers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Query Boosting</head><p>We also leveraged the framework to boost documents related to the task subdomain. Following previously tested strategies, we prioritize documents mentioning e.g. the following positive keywords:</p><p>• Oncology: "cancer", "carcinoma", "tumor" • Precision medicine: "treatment", "prevention", "prognosis", "survival", "outcome", "resistance" • Genetics: "gene", "genotype", "DNA", "base" • Chemotherapy suffixes: "*mab", "*nib", "*cin", "*one", "*ate", "*mus", "*lin"</p><p>For the BA subtask, we further boosted papers from the ASCO and AACR conferences on oncology, as this was deemed more relevant by the organizers due to their publications being more recent. Conversely, we downgraded documents related to in vitro research, viz. containing negative keywords such as "tissue" and "cell".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Reference Standard</head><p>For the 2018 TREC-PM challenge, the organizers provided access to the official 2017 Gold Standard (GS) <ref type="foot" coords="3,247.26,159.88,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_5">6</ref> , which has relevance assessments for 22,642 and 13,441 query-document pairs from the BA and CT tasks, respectively <ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.15,185.46,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It also contained the annotations that led to the final relevance assessments, including whether a given document was considered "Animal PM", "Human PM", or "Not PM". We thus leveraged it to ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,74.76,233.28,3.87,8.64">1</ref> As topics differed from the previous edition, we also created an internal gold standard for 2018 containing 336 and 141 query-document pairs for the biomedical articles and clinical trials tasks, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Hand-crafted Rules</head><p>Based on the manual assessment of results in the GS, we enriched queries with additional hand-crafted rules for nonmelanomas, solid tumors, and gene families.</p><p>Firstly, we noticed that a high number of results for topics about "melanoma" would match biomedical articles and clinical trials about "non-melanoma". We overcame this situation by manually adding an exact query clause to exclude such results. This was aimed at improving precision on the relevant topics.</p><p>Secondly, we realized that a large part of relevant clinical trials in the 2017 reference standard did not mention the exact topic disease, but would rather prefer an umbrella term, such as "solid tumor". Since such concepts were not included in the terminologies we used, we built a simple query decorator that would add "solid" as a hypernym if the disease did not mention "lymphoma" or "leukemia". This was geared towards improving recall.</p><p>Thirdly, we observed that clinical trials would commonly not mention the exact gene from the topic, but its family (e.g. "BRCA" instead of "BRCA2"). Instead of integrating terminology resources with such information, we explored a straightforward and naive approach based on regular expressions to generate proper term variations and thus improve recall. Using the pattern ([0-9]{1,2}[A-Z]{0,2}|R[0-9]{0,1})$, we removed up to two trailing digits (followed or not by up to two letters) or a trailing R (denoting "receptor") optionally followed by a digit. This accounts e.g. for the following substitutions: Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,358.19,223.94,2.99,6.91">3</ref>. An overview of our complete experimental setup.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,321.94,255.20,215.11,101.48">• BRCA2 → BRCA • TP53 → TP • CDK6 → CDK • FGFR1 → FGF • EGFR → EGF • PIK3CA → PIK III. ADDITIONAL METHODS FOR BIOMEDICAL ABSTRACTS</formula><p>Given the large amount of documents in the biomedical abstracts subtask and its unstructured nature, we adapted existing components to process such data in an efficient way and explored new tools to better understand the idea of "precision medicine" captured by annotators in the gold standard. We therefore describe such efforts in this dedicated section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. UIMA Pipeline</head><p>The main building block of the experimental architecture for BA was a linguistic UIMA preprocessing pipeline connected to the ES instance and the experimental framework as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,400.72,497.01,3.74,8.64">3</ref>. The right-arrow elements stand for UIMA components, sometimes aggregating multiple primitive components. The rectangle with rounded edges represents the experimental framework (described in Section II-A) which is the heart of our research effort. The other rectangles connected to the experimental framework depict the input and output data that are always required or delivered. The parallelograms represent the case where evaluation data is available to indicate that the experimental framework can run searches on ES as well as evaluate the results.</p><p>We used the UIMA-based JCORE repository <ref type="bibr" coords="3,505.78,616.81,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to read the 2017 PUBMED snapshot delivered by the challenge organizers, to recognize gene and organism mentions, apply our precision medicine document classifier (see Section III-C) and, finally, to index the output of an Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline results into ES. For the recognition of gene mentions we employed BANNER <ref type="foot" coords="3,417.18,686.88,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_6">7</ref> which is available as a JCORE component 8 . The BANNER gene model was trained on the complete BioCreative II GM 9 train and test data.</p><p>As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,155.58,76.79,3.74,8.64">3</ref>, the JCORE components form a processing sequence called pipeline in UIMA: the output of one component may serve as input for subsequent components. Since the gene tagger requires linguistic information such as sentence and token segmentation of the text and parts of speech for the tokens, the basic linguistic processing components run before the gene tagger. Those are actually multiple components but they are shown aggregated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,232.49,160.47,4.98,8.64">3</ref> for simplicity reasons. We indexed in ES the document ID, title, abstract, keywords, MeSH headings, gene mentions found by BANNER and the precision medicine label as predicted by the PM classifier (see Section III-C).</p><p>The resulting UIMA text annotations were stored in a POSTGRESQL database leveraging the JEDIS system <ref type="bibr" coords="4,285.91,232.66,10.58,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. With it, we could store all annotation levels (e.g. tokens, sentences, or genes) separately from each other, which allowed individual updates and eased experimentation. In our case, we could run development versions of the PM classifier and store the results in the JEDIS annotation database without the need to recreate the other annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Topic Modelling and TF-IDF</head><p>As manual keyword selection for boosting (see Section II-C) is time-consuming and requires curation by experts, we explored automated approaches that could exploit the knowledge already encoded in the GS to identify candidate words for boosting.</p><p>We first leveraged the official annotations linked to the 2017 GS (as described in Section II-D) to identify topics. Topic Modelling (TM) is an unsupervised technique to build probability distributions between so-called topics and the word types observed in a set of input documents. Topics form an intermediate layer between a document d and its contained word types w ∈ V where V is the vocabulary of words taken into account. A document covers a set of topics where each topic t defines an a posteriori distribution p(w|t) of words occurring in t [6], <ref type="bibr" coords="4,125.06,511.41,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,77.98,523.37,11.62,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref> using the MALLET 10 2.0.9 toolkit. TM found topics whose top-words strongly matched our intuition of PM.</p><p>In a similar effort, we experimented with TF-IDF analysis in the 2017 GS to obtain discriminant keywords of relevant PM biomedical articles. We thus looked for words that had a high TF-IDF score for PM and a low score for Not-PM, further selected as candidate "positive keywords". Conversely, we looked for terms with a high TF-IDF score for Not-PM and a low TF-IDF score for PM and selected them as candidates for "negative keywords".</p><p>In order to craft the final keyword lists, we mixed the distinct candidate terms obtained from both approaches (i.e. LDA and TF-IDF) and created experiments with different 8 https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-base 9 http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative 2 gm.html 10 http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ combinations of them to analyze which ones improved evaluation metrics the most. We then replaced our positive and negative boosters with the ones providing a real improvement on metrics (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,403.15,210.15,8.16,8.64" target="#tab_4">IV</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. PM Classifier</head><p>We also explored a supervised approach to automatically learn the intuition behind "precision medicine" and improve ranking with a so-called PM classifier.</p><p>For this task, we computed word TF-IDF estimates of document tokens from the TREC-PM 2017 gold standard using the SecondString<ref type="foot" coords="4,365.67,305.50,6.97,6.05" target="#foot_7">11</ref> library. The documents' token TF-IDF values were used as features in a bag-of-words approach (A). As precision medicine often revolves around specific genes, we also added automatic gene mention tagging via BANNER to our preprocessing as described in Section III-A. We added the number of found genes in a document as well as the name of the genes as they appeared in the text (B). Additionally, we added the names of organism text mentions as detected by the LINNEAUS tagger <ref type="bibr" coords="4,421.66,402.81,11.62,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (C) and, if available, the major MeSH descriptor names of the document (D) as features. Some documents were inconsistently tagged for PM in the gold standard for different query topics; in such cases we assigned the document the PM gold label.</p><p>We then built a Maximum Entropy (a.k.a logistic regression) classifier on top of these four feature groups. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,533.69,474.81,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_2">4</ref> illustrates how the features were extracted from a document and placed into the classifier to obtain the PM or the Not-PM label for the input document. A stratified ten-fold cross-validation on the 2017 TREC-PM gold standard yielded a classification accuracy of 75%. The classifier was eventually trained on the complete GS and applied to the whole PUBMED snapshot. For each document, its label was stored in the search index and used at query time to boost documents that had been classified to be relevant to precision medicine.</p><p>We additionally tested the impact of each feature group on classification accuracy when compared to a baseline set as TF-IDF only (A). We thus designed four experiments <ref type="foot" coords="4,553.07,616.87,6.97,6.05" target="#foot_8">12</ref> , three with one feature group disabled and one with all feature groups, all including the TF-IDF baseline.</p><p>We performed paired Student's t-tests between each combination of the experiments (resulting in six tests since the direction of the test does not matter).

After performing the Holm-Bonferroni correction with a significance level of α = 0.05, the following comparisons showed significant differences:</p><p>• no gene features vs. no MeSH features (p &lt; 0.00001)</p><p>• no gene features vs. no organism features (p &lt; 0.0001)</p><p>• no gene features vs. all features (p &lt; 0.001) In all comparisons, the experiment excluding the gene features showed a lower accuracy than the other experiment. The gene features group was the only one that brought an actual improvement from a statistical point of view. The omission of the gene features had the largest impact and caused the ten-fold cross-validation accuracy to drop to 73%. Other runs varied only slightly from the score achieved with all features. Since the other features did not hurt, we left them activated in the hope of better generalization on unseen data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head><p>We submitted only automatic runs using differently weighted combinations of the strategies presented before.

The hpipubcommon   run had the best infNDCG (0.5605), P@10 (0.7060), and R-Prec (0.3658), on a tie with the hpipubnone run for the infNDCG and P@10 metrics. Run hpipubbase had slightly lower average for all metrics, which might suggest a positive effect of query expansion, as this was the only run not using it. Moreover, we could not show a benefit of using a PM classifier, as there was no large differences between the runs hpipubnone (not using the classifier), hpipubclass (using the classifier), and hpipuboost (boosting the classifier).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,318.78,117.17,236.12,123.47">Y Y Y Y Age/sex match Y Y Y Y Y Disease preferred term N Y Y Y Y Disease synonym N Y Y Y Y Disease hypernym N Y Y Y Y Gene description N N N N Y Gene synonym N Y Y Y Y Non-melanoma rule Y Y Y Y Y Solid tumor rule N N Y Y Y Gene family rule N N Y Y Y Phrase matching N N N Y N</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,351.81,674.09,4.98,8.64">7</ref> in the appendix shows the results for each topic.

Moreover, run hpictcommon had also a slightly lower median infNDCG. As it was the only run without gene family and solid tumor expansion (as described in Section II-E), this might suggest some benefit from these approaches. Our best runs hpictphrase and hpictall used almost the same strategies, except for "gene description" that was only used by hpictall and "phrase matching" that was exclusive to hpictphrase. This might suggest a benefit of using exact matching for CT.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,88.79,602.87,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_5">8</ref> in the appendix shows the results for each topic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DISCUSSION</head><p>Our work has some important limitations.</p><p>Firstly, despite the importance of query expansion and weighting, relative weights were found with a local greedy search only. A more comprehensive approach would be to perform grid search on all possible combinations. However, due to the high-dimensional problem, a naive approach is not feasible and thus some guided search (e.g. employing genetic algorithms) may be necessary.</p><p>Secondly, the terminological resources we employed were not fully comprehensive and therefore would miss some important parent concepts, as well as gene families. We tried to overcome that with hand-crafted rules, but a more robust approach would be to integrate other terminologies containing the necessary mappings. For example, we noticed that the NCI Thesaurus includes a predicate Neoplasm_Has_Special_Category for solid tumors.</p><p>Thirdly, some clinical trials included negated assessments in the inclusion criteria (e.g. "no prior history of breast cancer") instead of explicitly expressing them as exclusion criteria. Moreover, topics 21 and 22 required discriminating between "no" and "extensive" "tumor infiltrating lymphocytes". In order to proper tackle such cases, a proper mechanism for negation detection should be employed, which was not explored by our team. We did, however, manually addressed the prevalent case of "non-melanoma", as described in Section II-E.</p><p>Lastly, we trained the PM classifier only on biomedical abstracts and did not evaluate its overlap with the semiautomated keyword selection approach. Also, we used only the binary classifier output for filtering, while we could have used the probability value itself for improved ranking. We believe addressing such issues could lead to a fully-automated boosting mechanism that only depends on training data, thus turning TM and TF-IDF analysis unnecessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>Our work explored weighted query expansion with terminological resources for synonyms and hypernyms, keywordbased query boosting with terms obtained semi-automatically from topic modelling and TF-IDF analysis, a "precision medicine" classifier, and hand-crafted rules for issues not easily solved otherwise.</p><p>Weighted query expansion showed that it is possible to improve recall without a loss in precision and thus provided the most positive impact in our experiments. Associated with rules to infer the gene family and detect solid tumors, it further impoved clinical trials metrics. Furthermore, we showed that exact matching improves P@10 and R-Prec in the clinical trials subtask.</p><p>Results using a supervised PM classifier proved inconclusive as there was an overlap with the manual keyword boosting strategy. Nevertheless, we proved that a gene tagger does improve the accuracy of such classifier.</p><p>Overall, we had the top-performing P@10 and second best infNDCG and R-Prec in the biomedical articles subtask. Considering clinical trials, our group had the top-performing infNDCG. Therefore, next steps would involve building upon the existent successful strategies.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,90.84,189.88,167.32,6.91;2,71.68,50.54,205.63,126.60"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
