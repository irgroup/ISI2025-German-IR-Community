<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the system designed for the TREC 2018 Precision Medicine Track by the Team Cat-Garfield from Tsinghua University. Our system is composed of two parts: the retrieval part aiming at high recall metric and the re-ranking part aiming at boosting infNDCG, P@10 and R-prec metrics via a heuristic scoring scheme. In order to introduce more external information into our systems, we developed a knowledge graph named TREC-KG, which plays a significant role in both the query expansion and the re-ranking part, and we utilized the qrels of TREC 2017 Precision Medicine Track as annotated data to train a classifier for precision medicine-relatedness of biomedical articles, named PM Classifier. In particular, we employed a hybrid method to score the precision medicine-relatedness of each retrieved article, combining the data-driven PM Classifier and a rule-based scoring scheme. The final results demonstrate that our systems are effective in both the biomedical article retrieval task and the clinical trial retrieval task, and the usage of the PM Classifier would bring performance improvement on R-prec metric in the biomedical article retrieval task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Precision medicine is a term used to describe individualized treatment that encompasses the use of new diagnostics and therapeutics, targeted to the needs of a patient based on his/her own genetic, biomarker, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,194.10,560.31,11.87,9.69" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Same as the track in 2017, TREC 2018 Precision Medicine Track focuses on the retrieval of biomedical articles and clinical trials which can provide useful precision medicine-related information to clinicians treating cancer patients. Participants are challenged with two tasks, the biomedical article retrieval task and the clinical trial retrieval task. The participants' retrieval systems are required to identify the biomedical articles addressing treatments in the perspective of precision medicine-relatedness, and the clinical trials for which the patient is eligible.</p><p>The track provides 50 topics consist of synthetic patient cases. A little different from 2017, the "other" field is removed, and the 2018 track introduces several immunotherapy-related topics, which do not contain explicit genes and mutations, but rather description of biomarkers for immunotherapy.</p><p>In this work, we present our systems for the two tasks. For both the biomedical article retrieval task and the clinical trial retrieval task, our submitted systems share the same architecture, which consists of a retrieval part and a reranking part. In the retrieval part, we index the given document collections, and retrieve documents for each topic via Apache Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="2,387.00,214.34,3.97,6.80" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , mainly focusing on the recall performance. In the re-ranking part, we employed a scoring scheme to re-rank the retrieved documents. Different from the retrieval part, we use concepts extracted via MetaMap<ref type="foot" coords="2,264.20,250.20,3.97,6.80" target="#foot_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,268.67,251.78,9.97,9.69" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, in addition to the original text, to score the relevance between the retrieved documents and topics, mainly focusing on the precision performance. We hope that this manner, using different features and focusing on different goals, would bring complementarity between the two parts and improve the retrieval performance.</p><p>In addition, we utilized some external resources. We constructed a knowledge graph, referred as TREC Knowledge Graph (TREC-KG), for both the biomedical article task and the clinical trial task And we trained a classifier for precision medicine-relatedness of a article , referred as Precision Medicine Classifier (PM Classifier). The TREC-KG and the PM Classifier are detailed in Section 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>We intuitively hope to improve system performance by introducing more external information, and we have tried two methods. We have built a knowledge graph, referred as TREC-KG, from several knowledge sources of interest. The TREC-KG was used for both the biomedical article task and the clinical trial task. We also utilize the qrels of TREC 2017 Precision Medicine Track as annotated data to train a classifier for precision medicine-relatedness of a article, referred as PM Classifier. The PM Classifier was used to improve the system performance of biomedical article retrieval task by evaluating the relevance of the article to "treatment".</p><p>Shown as Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,223.68,538.11,3.88,9.69">1</ref>, the architecture of our systems consists of two parts, text based document retrieval and concept based document re-ranking.</p><p>For the text based document retrieval part, we expanded the queries incorporating the TREC-KG, and then retrieved candidate documents by Apache Lucene. Then for the concept based document re-ranking part, we built a reranker incorporating the TREC-KG and the PM Classifier, using concepts extracted via MetaMap as additional features of documents, and finally obtained the re-ranked candidate documents. of distinct methods to depict and model knowledge in the medical domain. The leftmost knowledge bases in the Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,307.75,403.39,4.98,9.69">2</ref> are the main sources of knowledge for the TREC-KG that we desired to build. In addition to these knowledge bases, we also incorporated Cancer Genome Interpreter(CGI) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.87,427.30,13.02,9.69" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, CIViC <ref type="bibr" coords="4,411.20,427.30,13.84,9.69" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, OncoKB <ref type="bibr" coords="4,464.58,427.30,16.01,9.69" target="#b2">[3]</ref> etc.</p><p>Knowledge Acquisition Knowledge acquisition is to extract desired knowledge which is relevant to the TREC 2018 Precision Medicine Track from vast amount of information contained in these medical knowledge bases. This phase corresponds to the Downloading in the Extraction Box of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,420.32,505.85,3.88,9.69">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge Integration and Normalization</head><p>Medical knowledge from Knowledge Acquisition Phase contains massive amount of heterogeneous data due to dis-connectivity of various knowledge bases we used for the development of the TREC-KG. Therefore, Knowledge Integration is required to cope with the challenge of data heterogeneity induced by dis-connectivity of different knowledge bases. During the process of Knowledge Integration, triples in the format of (head, relation, tail) are utilized to represent medical knowledge, or rather, relationships between different entities including drugs, cancers and genes. Taking the diversity of formats adopted by individual medical knowledge resource into consideration, a variety of triple extraction interfaces should be designed specifically and carefully, respectively for each medical knowledge resource. The interface design phase corresponds to the Parsing in the Extraction Box. After the parsing interface design is completed, the design process will enter the Knowledge Extraction. During the Knowledge Extraction, triples of interest are extracted in accordance with the entity types.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,180.87,167.13,4.98,9.69" target="#fig_1">3</ref> gives an overview of the TREC-KG. This highly customized knowledge graph contains three kinds of entities: gene, cancer and drug.</p><p>The three kinds of entities contain different attributes. The attributes of a gene entity include gene name, synonyms, full name, authoritative name, and entrez id etc. The attributes of a cancer entity include synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, DOID, and ICD10 Code. And the attributes of a drug entity include synonyms, chembl id, generic name and brand name.</p><p>Different kinds of entities are related to each other through different relationships. For instance, the relationship between a gene entity and a drug entity involves a variety of interactions, such as inhibitors, blockers and so on. After the extraction of triples, MetaMap is applied for entity linking, or rather, mapping the literal form of entities to Concept Unique Identifier(CUI). This is exactly what Identifier Normalization does. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Implementation of the PM Classifier</head><p>Due to the requirement that we should pay more attention to the precision medicine-relatedness of the retrieved documents, we have to consider whether a retrieved document focuses on precision medicine. Because the standards to determine whether a document is precision medicine-related is implicit, fuzzy and hard to express via human language, it is reasonable to introduce data-driven methods to tackle it. We cast the problem as a text classification problem-given a retrieved document, determine whether it focuses on precision medicine. The training corpus is the qrels of TREC 2017 Precision Medicine Track, about 20,000 retrieved biomedical articles were annotated with "PM" for "Precision Medicine" and "Not PM" for "Not Precision Medicine". Different from the typical form of text classification where the sentence to be classified is in literal form, we converted original sentences into sequences of CUIs (Unique Concept Identifier) in UMLS via MetaMap and conducted classification on the converted "sentence", or rather, sequence of CUIs. During the preprocessing of text, we only focus on the 1500 most frequently CUIs.</p><p>In order to conduct the text classification task, we employed the simple Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,302.50,268.22,20.10,9.69" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed by Ye Zhang and Byron Wallace in 2015, as well as the model, that is a little more complex, Text Recurrent Neural Network (TextRCNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,291.38,292.13,15.03,9.69" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which constructs the representation of text using a convolutional neural network and captures contextual information with the recurrent structure.</p><p>In the light of the intuition that the CNN-based model TextCNN and the RNN-based model TextRCNN may capture different aspects of semantics in text, which are essential to determine the true class of a sentence or CUI sequence, we combined the two models by concatenating the feature representations obtained after max-pooling in TextCNN and TextRCNN. The concatenated representations were then passed into a fully-connected softmax layer to determine the final class. We called the combined model as "TextRCNN-CNN" model.</p><p>The word embeddings used in these two models were randomly initialized at the beginning of the training process. We tried different size of word embeddings, including 50, 100 and 200. The experiments showed that the word embeddings of size 50 were the best option.</p><p>For TextCNN and TextRCNN, we implemented our models using convolution kernels of 2, 3, 5, 7 with 15 feature maps each. For TextRCNN, we set the state size of the BiLSTM to 50, the same as the word embedding size. The number of hidden units of the full-connected softmax layer layer is 32. We trained our models with Adam optimizer using the learning rate of 0.001.</p><p>In order to alleviate the effect of overfitting, we divided the qrels into five groups with respect to different topics, referred as blue, yellow, green, red and black. During the training process, we trained different models using each group as test set and the other groups as training set to avoid over-fitting for specific diseases. The groups are detailed in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,320.72,578.62,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,176.00,593.46,4.98,9.69" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the performance of the PM Classifier implemented by TextCNN , TextRCNN and TextCNN-CNN respectively.</p><p>According to Table <ref type="table" coords="6,238.58,620.25,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the PM Classifier implemented by TextRCNN-CNN achieved the best performance on the groups of yellow, green, black, and best average performance over the five groups. We finally ensembled these TextRCNN-CNN models with majority voting strategy as our PM Classifier. For MEDLINE articles in xml format, we indexed five fields, including "PMID", "ArticleTitle", "AbstractText", "MeshHeadingList" and "ChemicalList". And in particular, the gender and age information in the "MeshHeadingList" was indexed separately according to Table <ref type="table" coords="7,295.10,418.54,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. In addition, we indexed the annotations of Disease, Gene and Mutation subject to each article, which are provided by PubTator <ref type="bibr" coords="7,358.71,620.25,18.54,9.69" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>For the AACR/ASCO Proceedings articles, we were only able to index a subset of the fields for MEDLINE articles, including Article ID, ArticleTitle and AbstractText, because these articles were only available in text format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indexing of Clinical Trials</head><p>Similar to the indexing of biomedical articles, we indexed several fields of clinical trials in xml format via Lucene. We did a preprocessing for each trial because there were many fields which are not related to the retrieval task. In the pre-processing, we extracted useful fields and separated the Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria from the Eligibility field. Finally, we indexed the fields NCT ID, Title, Brief Title, Brief Summary, Detailed Description, Study Type, Intervention Type, Inclusion Criteria, Exclusion Criteria, Healthy Volunteers, Keywords and MeSH Terms. And in particular, the gender and age information in the fields of "Gender" and "Min/Max Age" was indexed separately according to Table <ref type="table" coords="8,266.60,226.59,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Query Expansion Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,261.01,390.21,4.98,9.69" target="#fig_2">4</ref> presents the framework of our query expansion strategy. We paid more attention to the fields of disease and gene of the topic to conduct query expansion.</p><p>For the disease field, we expanded the disease name with its synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms via the TREC-KG. While for the gene field, it contains two aspects of information, gene name and amino acids related to the variant. For gene name, the literal form of gene name provided in the topic is not sufficient enough to retrieve relevant articles or trials due to the diversity of the gene name representations. We expanded the gene name with its synonyms, full names, related drugs which interact with the focused gene, together with corresponding interaction. For each amino acid (20 in total), we expanded it with its three-letter abbreviation coupling with single-letter abbreviation.</p><p>In particular, as for the immunotherapy-related topics, we simply expand the biomarker appearing in the gene field with their synonyms and relevant keywords representing descriptions in the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biomedical Article Retrieval</head><p>We completed this part by 1) retrieval based on TF-IDF feature via Lucene and 2) post-processing.</p><p>For each topic, we retrieve biomedical articles according to the following three steps:</p><p>1. Topic Expansion: We expanded each topic by using our query expansion results. We expanded the disease with its synonyms, hyponyms and MeSH_ID, expanded the gene with its full name, synonyms and Entrez_ID, and expanded the variant with its synonyms and PubTator_ID. In particular, for the immunotherapy-related topics, we expanded the biomarker with its synonyms and several keywords. 2. Generate Query: We encoded the disease, gene and variant as three additive disjunctive Boolean query with a clause, noted as Q d ,Q g and Q v . We combined Q d ,Q g and Q v into a Boolean query Q 1 according to Table <ref type="table" coords="9,472.83,398.54,3.88,9.69">5</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we generated a boost query Q 2 subject to precision medicinerelatedness by using words in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,310.27,422.45,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. 3. Retrieval via Lucene: We used the combination of Q 1 and Q 2 for the retrieval.</p><p>We reserved the top 150,000 results for each topic, noted this list as C 0 .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,213.45,486.42,4.13,8.83">5</ref>. Generating Q1 for biomedical article retrieval task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additive disjunctive query Weight</head><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="9,258.53,518.68,117.99,54.17">Q d ∨ Qg ∨ Qv 4.5 Q d ∨ Qg 4.0 Q d ∧ Qg ∨ Qv 5.0 Q d ∧ (Qg ∨ Qv) 6.0 Q d ∧ Qg ∧ Qv 9.0</formula><p>However, the TF-IDF features can not reveal the topics of the articles well. We address this problem by post-processing including the following three aspects:</p><p>1. Matching Age &amp; Gender: For each result in C 0 , we attempted to match the age and gender between the topic and the article, and the award weights for age and gender were 1.2 and 1.5 respectively. All weights above were set by grid searching on the qrels of the TREC 2017 PM Track. Finally, we ranked C 0 by the new scores, and reserved the top 20,000 results for each topic.</p><p>Clinical Trial Retrieval Similarly, we completed this part by 1) retrieval based on TF-IDF feature via Lucene and 2) post-processing.</p><p>We retrieve clinical trials according to the following three steps:</p><p>1. Topic Expansion: Mainly the same as the retrieval for biomedical articles.</p><p>In particular, we used "solid tumor" as a expansion for all diseases. 2. Generate Query: We generated Q 1 and Q 2 according to Table <ref type="table" coords="10,425.36,351.75,4.98,9.69">7</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="10,453.10,351.75,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, just the same as the retrieval for biomedical articles. 3. Retrieval via Lucene: We used the combination of Q 1 and Q 2 for the retrieval We reserved the top 20,000 results for each topic, noted as C 0 .</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="10,224.96,424.23,4.13,8.83">7</ref>. Generating Q1 for clinical trial retrieval task.</p></div>

Matching Age &amp; Gender: The same as the retrieval for biomedical articles and the weights for age and gender are 7.5 and 5 respectively. 2. Punishment for EXCLUSION_CRITERIA: We retrieved in the field of EX-CLUSION_CRITERIA with Q 1 and reserved a ranked list C e . And then we penalized the score of articles both in C e and C 0 with punishment weight of 0.01.</p><p>All weights above were set by grid searching on the qrels of the TREC 2017 PM Track. Finally, we ranked C 0 by the new scores, and reserved the top 20,000 results for each topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Concept Based Document Re-ranking</head><p>Re-ranking of Biomedical Articles For the biomedical article retrieval task, we built our re-ranker based on the concepts extracted via MetaMap in addition to the original text. Along with the evaluation method, we implemented our reranker in a heuristic way, respectively scoring each candidate document in three dimensions -disease, gene(and variant) and PM.</p><p>Our main idea to improve the retrieval performance is introducing more external information, specifically more features and more annotated data. In addition to the text features used in the text based document retrieval part, we used the concepts extracted via MetaMap from each document as additional features. We treated the qrels of the TREC 2017 PM Track as additional annotated data, and the PM Classifier results can be seen as a supplement to the PM dimension.</p><p>Our re-ranker, shown as Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,294.84,272.83,3.88,9.69" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, consists of four parts, namely Not PM Filter and three matchers corresponding to the three dimensions of disease, gene(and variant) and PM. We first filtered out the articles which are definitely not precision medicinerelated by a simple Not PM Filter. The Not PM Filter first filtered out articles without any concepts of cancer, and required the remaining articles to contain concepts of gene or treatment-related keywords indicated in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,426.37,583.70,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_5">6</ref>.</p><p>We built three matchers, corresponding to three dimensions of disease, gene(and variant) and PM, to score the relevance between the given topic and the retrieved articles. We heuristically set the weights for the matching of disease, gene, variant and precision medicine-relatedness.</p><p>For a given topic, we used the query expansion results of disease and gene(and variant) as text features, and the concepts extracted via MetaMap as concept features. In addition, for the gene field in the immunotherapy-related topics, we use the expanded biomarkers and keywords instead of original text as text features, and the corresponding concepts as concept features. These keywords were divided into 1-3 groups, representing different kinds of information of the description in the topic. Taking the gene field of topic 25 as an example, the original text, the biomarkers and the keywords are shown as Table <ref type="table" coords="12,428.73,178.77,3.88,9.69" target="#tab_6">8</ref>. For the dimension of disease, we scored the relevance by matching the text feature and concept feature of disease field between the given topic and the retrieved articles. The matching results were divided into three categories, "match", "more general" and "mismatch". The "more general" basically indicated that the disease in the topic is malignant whereas the article uses a more general description that does not distinguish between benign and malignant. We gave a penalty for the "more general" results, and an extra bonus when the text or concept matches the topic in the article title.</p><p>For the dimension of gene(and variant), we adopt different strategies depending on whether the topic is immunotherapy-related.</p><p>For the non immunotherapy-related topics, we scored each gene(and variant) given in the topic separately. The matching results were only divided into "match" and "mismatch". The "match" for variant required that the matching result for the corresponding gene is also "match". And similar to the Disease Matcher, we gave an extra bonus when the text or concept matches the topic in the article title. Finally, we selected the highest score among the genes(and variants) as the score of gene dimension of the article.</p><p>For the immunotherapy-related topics, we scored each article by matching the biomarkers and keywords in the article title or abstract. The matching rules are:</p><p>1. If each keywords group has at least one keyword matched in a single sentence, we treat the sentence "keyword matched". 2. If at least one biomarker matches in the sentence, we treat the sentence "biomarker matched". 3. If there is one sentence in the article both "keyword matched" and "biomarker matched", we treat the article "exact matched". 4. If there is no sentence both "keyword matched" and "biomarker matched", while there are sentences "keyword matched", we treat the article "partial matched". 5. If there is no sentence "keyword matched", we treat the article "mismatched".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Re-ranking of Clinical Trials</head><p>The re-ranker for the clinical trial retrieval task was similar to that for the biomedical article retrieval task, we also constructed a scoring scheme for the dimensions of disease, gene(and variant) and PM. The main difference is that the PM classifier is no longer used in the clinical trial retrieval task and we did some field mapping due to the different xml structure of the clinical trials, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,306.81,178.77,8.49,9.69" target="#tab_7">10</ref>. We also considered the fields of "study_type", "intervention_type" and "pri-mary_purpose". For example, if the field of "study_type" contains "intervention", the field of "intervention_type" contains "drug" or the fields of "genetic" and "primary_purpose" contain "treatment", we would give a bonus score.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Evaluation Results of Biomedical Article Retrieval Task</head><p>We submitted 5 runs for the biomedical article retrieval task. The difference between these runs is mainly the ways of using the PM Classifier and the corresponding weight. Table <ref type="table" coords="14,237.46,464.84,9.96,9.69" target="#tab_8">11</ref> shows a description of the 5 runs, and Table <ref type="table" coords="14,442.49,464.84,9.96,9.69" target="#tab_9">12</ref> shows our evaluation results, with the best and median results for the biomedical articles retrieval task.</p><p>The BASE run achieved the best performance on the metrics of infNDCG and P@10, while the PBPK run achieved the best performance on the metric of R-prec. These results indicate that the usage of the PM Classifier leads to performance loss on the metrics related to precision, but may bring gains on the metrics related to recall.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,181.63,560.48,4.98,9.69" target="#fig_4">6</ref> (a)-(d) demonstrate the impact of different ways of using the PM Classifier on R-prec metric for the biomedical article retrieval task. The strategies behaved differently across 50 topics. It appears that the PM Classifier trained on the qrels is not capable of capturing the implicit and fuzzy standards to determine whether a retrieved biomedical article is precision medicine-related across all the 50 topics.</p><p>It is evident that the former three strategies, PBAH, PBH and PBL, have a similar impact on R-prec metric of the retrieval system. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,440.69,644.16,4.98,9.69" target="#fig_4">6</ref> (a)-(c), there are more dark grey columns representing the decline of R-prec metric than green columns representing the improvement of R-prec metric, which indicates that these strategies deteriorate R-prec metric on average. However, the PBPK strategy, incorporating the PM Classifier results with the rule based PM Matcher, achieved an opposite result that the number of green columns is greater than that of dark grey columns, which indicates that the PBPK strategy can boost performance on R-prec metric.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we described our retrieval system for the TREC 2018 Precision Medicine Track. The track consists of two tasks, the biomedical article retrieval  Table <ref type="table" coords="17,203.93,116.01,9.04,8.83" target="#tab_3">13</ref>. Our submitted runs for the clinical trial retrieval task.</p><p>MSIIP_TRIAL1 Mainly the same as MSIIP_TRIAL3, but not considering the fields of "study_type", "intervention_type" and "primary_purpose" MSIIP_TRIAL2 Mainly the same as MSIIP_TRIAL5, but not using the query expansion results, not considering "study_type", "intervention_type" and "primary_purpose" fields. MSIIP_TRIAL3 Baseline, containing all our methods MSIIP_TRIAL4 Mainly the same as MSIIP_TRIAL5, but not using the query expansion results. MSIIP_TRIAL5 Mainly the same as MSIIP_TRIAL3, but for the immunotherapyrelated topics, employing the same matching strategy as other topics task and the clinical trial retrieval task. We submitted five runs for each task.</p><p>In the light of the intuition that introducing external information would bring performance improvement, we constructed the TREC-KG to integrate knowledge of interest from several external knowledge sources, and trained the PM Classifier for precision medicine-relatedness using the qrels of the TREC 2017 PM Track as training corpus. Our system architecture consists of a text-based retrieval part and a concept-based re-ranking part, incorporating the TREC-KG and the PM Classifier. In particular, to score the precision medicine-relatedness of a biomedical article, we employed a hybrid method, combining our proposed data-driven PM Classifier with the rule-based PM Matcher.</p><p>Our experiments verify the effectiveness of our system on both the two tasks, and that the usage of the PM Classifier would boost R-prec metric on the biomedical article retrieval task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,134.77,359.08,345.83,8.83;3,134.77,370.07,345.82,8.74;3,134.77,381.03,214.49,8.74;3,201.81,220.26,215.37,102.25"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We finally score the gene dimension of the article according to the matching result.</p><p>For the dimension of PM, we built a ruled-based PM Matcher which mainly depends on matching the retrieved articles with manually summarized keywords and information obtained from the TREC-KG, such as cancer-related drugs. We tried to determine whether a retrieved biomedical article focuses on precision medicine in a hybrid manner, combining the data-driven PM Classifier and the rule-based PM Matcher.</p><p>We manually summarized several keywords lists, shown as Table <ref type="table" coords="13,434.87,222.07,3.88,9.69">9</ref>. In addition, we extracted a related drug list for each topic via the TREC-KG. For each retrieved article, we first divided it into several parts, including title, MeshHeading List, Chemical List, background, objective, conclusion, and unspecified, by the xml structure or simply matching the corresponding part name. The PM Matcher then tried to match each category of keywords with each part of the article, and match the related drug list with the parts of title, MeshHeading List, Chemical List and conclusion of the article. And then the PM Matcher scored the article in the PM dimension based on these matching results. Note that, the PM Matcher would severely penalize the article if the Negative Keywords matched.</p><p>We then tried to integrate the PM Classifier results into the score for the PM dimension in two ways. One is giving an additional score to the articles classified as "PM" in addition to the score given by the PM Matcher. The other is that 1) if the PM Classifier classifies the article as "PM", we give a score to the article for the PM dimension, not considering the PM Matcher results any more, 2) if the PM Classifier classifies the article as "Not PM", we score the article according to the scoring strategy of the PM Matcher. Finally, for each article, if it contains MeshHeading List field with age or gender information, we would filter it out if it doesn't match the "demographic" of the topic. And for other cases, we didn't consider the "demographic".</p></div>			</div>
