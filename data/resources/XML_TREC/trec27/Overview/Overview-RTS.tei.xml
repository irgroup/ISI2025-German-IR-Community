<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>e TREC 2018 Real-Time Summarization (RTS) Track is the third iteration of a community e ort to explore techniques, algorithms, and systems that automatically monitor streams of social media posts such as tweets on Twi er to address users' prospective information needs. ese needs are articulated as "interest pro les", akin to topics in ad hoc retrieval. In our formulation of real-time summarization, the goal is for a system to deliver relevant and novel content to users in a timely fashion. We refer to these messages generically as "updates".</p><p>As with previous iterations of the evaluation, the task setup required participating systems to monitor the live Twi er sample stream during a pre-de ned evaluation period, this year beginning Monday July 23, 2018 00:00:00 UTC and ending Friday August 3, 2018 23:59:59 UTC. e interest pro les were distributed to participants ahead of time. e RTS evaluation considered two methods for disseminating updates:</p><p>• Scenario A: Real-time updates. As soon as the system identi es a relevant tweet, it is immediately delivered to the user's mobile device (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,159.23,377.55,2.99,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). ese updates should be relevant (on topic), novel (users should not be delivered multiple notications that say the same thing), and timely (updates should be provided as soon a er the actual event occurrence as possible). • Scenario B: Email digests. Alternatively, a user might wish to receive a daily email digest that summarizes "what happened" on that day with respect to the interest pro les (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,267.51,443.30,2.93,7.94" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). One might think of these emails as supplying "personalized headlines". ese results should be relevant and novel, but timeliness is not particularly important provided that the posts were all wri en on the day for which the digest was produced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">EVALUATION DESIGN</head><p>e RTS evaluation at TREC 2018 followed the same methodology as the evaluation in TREC 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,173.53,539.67,9.52,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, except with two substantive changes, described below. Anything that is not explicitly discussed in this track overview can be assumed to have remained unchanged from last year. Push vs. pull in mobile update delivery. For scenario A, participating systems subscribed to the live Twi er sample stream during the evaluation period to identify tweets relevant to interest pro les in real time. Based on each system's algorithm, these updates were submi ed to the RTS evaluation broker (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,241.69,635.71,2.93,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), which then immediately delivered the updates to a group of mobile assessors who were speci cally recruited for the evaluation (framed as a user study). is in situ evaluation setup accurately mimicked the deployment of update delivery systems, since the assessors were simply going about their daily lives and could choose to either ignore or engage with systems' updates.   In 2016, updates were delivered to the assessors' mobile devices (via a custom app developed by the track organizers) and each update was accompanied by a push noti cation, an explicit alert that drew their a ention to the update <ref type="bibr" coords="1,440.50,548.04,9.27,7.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We refer to this as the "push" interface condition. In 2017, updates were delivered to the assessors' mobile devices (via a completely redesigned mobile web app), but each update was not accompanied by a push noti cation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,534.03,580.91,9.52,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In other words, delivery was akin to depositing updates into an email inbox, and the assessor had to proactively (i.e., on the assessor's own initiative) visit a mobile interface to examine system updates. We refer to this as the "pull" interface condition.</p><p>e behavior of mobile assessors under these two interface conditions was the subject of a SIGIR 2018 paper <ref type="bibr" coords="1,427.83,646.67,9.44,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which compared how assessors rendered their judgments in 2016 and 2017. However, an explicit weakness of the study was that it did not control for a number of factors such as the assessment interface and the interest pro les, since the user behavior data drew from two di erent iterations of the RTS Track. is year, we wished to more closely examine behavioral differences between "push" and "pull" mechanisms for noti cation delivery. is required rebuilding the update delivery infrastructure so that push noti cations could be more carefully controlled and isolated as the experimental variable. A er careful initial study, we decided to use the Telegram messaging platform. 1 Speci cally, mobile assessors installed the Telegram messaging app on their mobile devices and updates were delivered via a Telegram bot we built called the RTS bot. e assessors were asked to subscribe to the bot. Updates from participating systems, along with the associated interest pro le (i.e., the information need), were delivered as messages in the Telegram app from our bot. Assessors provided judgments by clicking on bu ons indicating that the tweet was relevant, not relevant, or redundant, which triggered corresponding API invocations that recorded the decision in a backend database. A screenshot from the interface is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,241.45,661.11,3.07,7.94" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>We randomly divided the mobile assessors into the "push" and "pull" interface conditions. Prior to the evaluation period, as part of 1 h ps://telegram.org/ the assessor onboarding process, we ensured that all participants in the pull condition switched their push noti cations o in the app se ings. at is, the delivery of a system update did not trigger a noti cation on their mobile devices. Instead, the assessors had to visit the messaging app on their own initiative to examine the delivered updates. For users in the push condition, we veri ed that push noti cations did indeed accompany update delivery. In this way, we carefully manipulated the mobile interface such that the presence or absence of push noti cations was the only di erence, corresponding to our variable of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disjoint interest pro les between mobile assessors and NIST assessors.</head><p>In both the 2016 and 2017 iterations of the RTS Tracks, scenario A systems were evaluated by both mobile assessors (i.e., using the in situ evaluation methodology described in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,512.14,235.11,3.49,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) as well as NIST assessors (i.e., using a traditional pool-based methodology). Scenario B (which modeled daily email digests) was only evaluated with judgments from NIST assessors.</p><p>However, a relevance feedback mechanism introduced in the 2017 evaluation presented a complication: In 2017, as well as in this year's evaluation, participating systems in scenario A were able to obtain the mobile assessors' relevance judgments as they were being generated during the evaluation period. is allowed systems to experiment with relevance feedback and techniques based on active learning, or otherwise alter the system's behavior. As a result, consistency between the mobile assessors and NIST assessors became an issue since participating systems could have been incorporating live feedback. To avoid divergence of relevance criteria, in the batch assessments, NIST assessors were asked to consider the mobile judgments and to maintain consistency if possible; see the track overview from last year <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.57,410.45,10.64,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the exact instructions given to the NIST assessors. us, potentially noisy judgments from the mobile assessors unavoidably a ected the NIST judgments, but it is unclear to what extent con icting relevance judgments a ected their overall quality.</p><p>To avoid the same issue this year, the mobile assessors and NIST assessors examined system updates from completely disjoint interest pro les. e e ect is that scenario A systems were only assessed by mobile assessors and scenario B systems were only assessed by NIST assessors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>In total, we had 142 interest pro les created by the mobile assessors (scenario A) and 156 pro les created by the NIST assessors (scenario B) this year.</p><p>For scenario A, we received a total of 14 runs from 6 groups. ese runs submi ed a total of 23,021 tweets, or 13,756 unique tweets a er de-duplicating within each interest pro le (but not across interest pro les). We recruited a total of 53 mobile assessors for the in situ evaluation of the scenario A systems: 27 were assigned to the "pull" condition and 26 were assigned to the "push" condition. Two assessors did not judge any tweets. Not including these two, the remaining assessors judged a total of 26,150 tweets; mean 513, median 469, max 1317. e distribution of judgments by assessor is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,385.81,679.54,3.13,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. e columns list: assessor id, the number of judgments provided, the number of pro les subscribed to, and the number of tweets delivered to that assessor. e nal column shows the response rate, computed as the ratio between the second and fourth columns.</p><p>Evaluation results for scenario A systems by the mobile assessors are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,126.40,119.67,3.11,7.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. e metrics and presentation is exactly the same as last year <ref type="bibr" coords="3,116.93,130.63,9.29,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. e rst two columns show the participating team and run. e next columns show the number of tweets that were judged relevant (R), redundant (D), and not relevant (N); the number of unjudged tweets (U); the length of each run (L), de ned as the total number of messages delivered by the system. e next column shows coverage (C), de ned as the fraction of unique tweets that were judged. Following that, the columns report the mean ( t) and median ( t) latency of submi ed tweets in seconds, measured with respect to the time the original tweet was posted. e next sets of columns provide metrics of quality: strict and lenient precision, strict and lenient utility. e rows in the results table are sorted by strict precision.</p><p>For scenario B, we received a total of 11 runs from 4 groups. Evaluation results based on NIST assessors are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,289.16,273.10,3.13,7.94" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>e metrics and presentation is exactly the same as last year <ref type="bibr" coords="3,282.34,284.06,9.52,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, with runs sorted by nDCG-p. For reference, the empty run would have received nDCG-p and nDCG-1 scores of 0.7557.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>is year represents the nal year of the Real-Time Summarization Track, the culmination of a journey that began with the Microblog Track at TREC 2011. During these eight years, the tracks have explored numerous aspects of users' information needs as they pertain to social media posts, with tweets on Twi er as representatives of such texts. Over the years, the tracks have brought together researchers with common interests, built test collections, and contributed to evaluation methodologies. However, with diminishing marginal bene ts to the broader community, we believe it is time to make way for di erent avenues of exploration at TREC.  e rst two columns show the participating team and run. e next columns show the number of tweets that were judged relevant (R), redundant (D), and not relevant (N); the number of unjudged tweets (U); the length of each run (L), de ned as the total number of messages delivered by the system. e next columns show coverage (C), de ned the fraction of unique tweets that were judged; the mean ( t) and median ( t) latency of submitted tweets in seconds, measured with respect to the time the original tweet was posted; strict and lenient precision; strict and lenient utility.
