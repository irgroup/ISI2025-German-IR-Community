<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The fundamental philosophy behind precision medicine is that for many complex diseases, there is no "one size fits all" solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is thus the hallmark of the emerging precision medicine paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely focused at the moment than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient's tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative <ref type="bibr" coords="1,204.12,482.31,121.46,8.74" target="#b0">(Collins and Varmus, 2015)</ref> launched by former President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program.</p><p>A fundamental difficulty with putting the findings of precision medicine into practice is that-by its very nature-precision medicine creates a huge space of treatment options <ref type="bibr" coords="1,380.27,518.17,78.72,8.74" target="#b1">(Frey et al., 2016)</ref>. These can easily overwhelm clinicians attempting to stay up-to-date with the latest findings, and can easily inhibit a clinician's attempts to determine the best possible treatment for a particular patient. However, the ability to quickly locate relevant evidence is the hallmark of information retrieval (IR).</p><p>For three consecutive years the TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track sought to evaluate IR systems that provide medical evidence at the point-of-care. The TREC Precision Medicine track, then, was launched to specialize the CDS track to the needs of precision medicine so IR systems can focus on this important issue. The Precision Medicine track has focused on a single field, oncology, for a specific use case, genetic mutations of cancer. This started with the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track and continued with the 2018 track described here. As described above, the main idea behind precision medicine is to use detailed patient information (largely genomic information in most current research) to identify the most effective treatments. Improving patient care in precision oncology then requires both (a) a mechanism to locate the latest research relevant to a patient, and (b) a fallback mechanism to locate the most relevant clinical trials when the latest techniques prove ineffective for a patient. In the first part, the track continues the previous Clinical Decision Support track (with a more focused use case), while in the second part expands the task to cover a new type of data (clinical trial descriptions were made for 2018 (with the exception of new, and an increased number of, topics). Since 2017 was the first year of the track, keeping minimal changes was an intentional choice to allow participants to develop new methods using the results of the prior year as a guide (2017 participants had no gold standard to utilize for system development). The remainder of this overview is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the historical context of medical IR evaluation that led to the Precision Medicine track; Section 3 describes the structure of the topics and the process of creating them; Section 4 outlines the retrieval tasks; Section 5 describes the evaluation method; finally, Section 6 details the results of the participant systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>The TREC Precision Medicine track continues a long tradition of biomedical retrieval evaluations within TREC. This started with the 2003-2007 TREC Genomics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.07,396.59,122.40,8.74" target="#b2">(Hersh and Voorhees, 2009)</ref> tracks, intended to connect genomics researchers to relevant biomedical literature. This was followed by the 2011 and 2012 TREC Medical Records tracks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.17,420.50,119.71,8.74" target="#b5">(Voorhees and Hersh, 2012)</ref>, focusing on retreiving cohorts of patients from electronic health records. The 2014-2016 TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,426.07,432.45,91.38,8.74" target="#b3">(Roberts et al., 2016)</ref> track targeted giving clinicians access to evidence-based literature. Then, starting in 2017, the TREC Precision Medicine <ref type="bibr" coords="2,116.15,456.36,92.92,8.74" target="#b4">(Roberts et al., 2017)</ref> track grew from the CDS track, focusing on a more narrow problem domain (precision oncology). The 2018 Precision Medicine track continues this effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Topics</head><p>The 2018 Precision Medicine track provided 50 topics created by oncologists from and resources provided by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Due to the difficulty in obtaining actual patient data, the topics were synthetically created, though often inspired by actual patients, with modification. <ref type="foot" coords="2,525.11,545.42,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref>The topics contain three key elements in a semi-structured format to reduce the need to perform natural language processing to identify the key elements. The three key elements are: (1) disease (e.g., type of cancer), (2) genetic variants (primarily the genetic variants in the tumors themselves as opposed to the patient's DNA), and (3) demographic information (e.g., age, sex), Four topics from the track are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,534.49,594.82,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The first two topics are additionally shown in their corresponding XML format (i.e., what was provided to the participants) in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,187.44,618.73,3.87,8.74">2</ref>. Note that the second example in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,369.40,618.73,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> is actually an immunotherapy marker, not a tumor genetic variant. Six of the 50 topics for 2018 were focused on immunotherapy. &lt;topic number="1"&gt; &lt;disease&gt;melanoma&lt;disease&gt; &lt;gene&gt;BRAF (V600E)&lt;gene&gt; &lt;demographic&gt;64-year-old male&lt;demographic&gt; &lt;topic&gt; &lt;topic number="2"&gt; &lt;disease&gt;anaplastic large cell lymphoma&lt;disease&gt; &lt;gene&gt;ALK&lt;gene&gt; &lt;demographic&gt;18-year-old male&lt;demographic&gt; &lt;/topic&gt; Table <ref type="table" coords="3,225.65,189.25,3.87,8.74">2</ref>: XML format for two topics from Table <ref type="table" coords="3,410.23,189.25,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Tasks</head><p>The two tasks in the Precision Medicine track correspond to two different corpora, each with different goals (underlined):</p><p>1. Literature Articles. Because precision medicine is a fast-moving field, keeping up-to-date with the latest literature can be challenging due to both the volume and velocity of scientific advances. Therefore, when treating patients, it would be helpful to present the most relevant scientific articles for an individual patient. The primary literature corpus is therefore a snapshot of MEDLINE abstracts (i.e., what is searchable through the PubMed interface). Relevant literature articles can guide precision oncologists to the best-known treatment options for the patient's condition. The treatment options are represented simply as the article abstract, participants do not need to provide a specific treatment name, simply an article describing a potential treatment. The same corpus as the 2017 track was utilized. Specifically, this corpus is composed of approximately 26.8 million MEDLINE abstracts and is supplemented with two additional sets of abstracts: (i) 37,007 abstracts from recent proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and (ii) 33,018 abstracts from recent proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). These additional datasets were added to increase the set of potentially relevant treatment information. Notably, the latest research is often presented at conferences such as ASCO and AACR prior to submission to journals (thus these proceedings may represent a more up-to-date snapshot of scientific knowledge than MEDLINE).</p><p>2. Clinical Trials. In many oncology patients, no approved treatment is available (or, commonly, none of the available treatments have proven effective). The common recourse in this case is to determine if any potential treatments are undergoing evaluation in a clinical trial. Therefore, in such situations, it would be helpful to automatically identify the most relevant clinical trials for an individual patient. Precision oncology trials typically use a certain treatment (e.g., a form of chemotherapy or radiation) for a certain disease with a specific genetic variant (or set of variants). Such trials can have complex inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that are challenging to match with automated systems <ref type="bibr" coords="3,486.78,526.60,55.46,8.74;3,98.90,538.56,22.14,8.74" target="#b6">(Weng et al., 2011)</ref>. The corpus is derived from ClinicalTrials.gov, a repository of past, present, and future clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad. A total of 241,006 clinical trial descriptions compose the corpus provided to participants. Note that for the purposes of this track, the state of the trial (e.g., recruiting, active, completed) and geographic location constraints are not considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation followed standard TREC evaluation procedures for ad hoc retrieval tasks. Participants submitted (in trec eval format) a maximum of five automatic or manual runs per task, each consisting of a ranked list of up to 1,000 literature article identifiers (PMIDs) and 1,000 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers per topic. That is, up to 10 total runs: a maximum of 5 literature runs and 5 clinical trial runs per topic. The highest ranked articles and trials for each topic were pooled and judged at OHSU by physicians and other biomedical subject matter experts. As in the 2017 Precision Medicine track, the assessment process was two-tiered: first a manual assessment was made by the human assessors based on several categories for each result (referred to here as Result Assessment), then a relevance score was assigned to the result based on its categorization (referred to here as Relevance Assessment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Result Assessment</head><p>Result assessment can be viewed as a set of multi-class annotations. Judging an individual result, whether an article or trial, proceeds in a cascaded manner with two steps: an initial pass ensures the article/trial is broadly relevant to precision medicine, after which the assessor categorizes the article/trial according to the three fields above.</p><p>See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,136.97,339.04,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for a flow chart style overview of this process. The first step is designed to save assessor time by filtering out unrelated articles/trials, since the second step can be more time-consuming (possibly requiring a more detailed reading of the article/trial). The assessors were free to quickly skim the article/trial in order to make the initial decision. Then, if the article/trial is relevant to precision medicine (by the standard outlined below), a more detailed reading may be necessary in order to accurately assess all fields.</p><p>Step 1 is to determine whether the article/trial is related to precision medicine. There are three options:</p><p>• Human PM: The article/trial (1) relates to humans, (2) involves some form of cancer, (3) focuses on treatment, prevention, or prognosis of cancer, and (4) relates in some way to at least one of the genes in the topic.</p><p>• Animal PM: Identical to Human PM requirements (2)-( <ref type="formula" coords="4,350.58,457.59,3.94,8.74">4</ref>), except for animal research.</p><p>• Not PM: Everything else. This includes "basic science" that focuses on understanding underlying genomic principles (e.g., pathways), but provides no evidence for treatment.</p><p>Step 2 is to determine the appropriate categorization for each of the three fields:</p><p>1. Disease:</p><p>• Exact: The form of cancer in the article/trial is identical to the one in the topic.</p><p>• More General: The form of cancer in the article/trial is more general than the one in the topic (e.g., blood cancer vs. leukemia). • More Specific: The form of cancer in the article/trial is more specific than the one in the topic (e.g., squamous cell lung carcinoma vs. lung cancer). • Not Disease: The article/trial is not about a disease, or is about a different disease (or type of cancer) than the one in the topic.</p><p>2. Gene [for each particular gene in the topic]</p><p>• Exact: The article/trial focuses on the exact gene and variant as the one in the topic. If the topic does not contain a specific variant, then this holds as long as the gene is included. By "focus" this means the gene/variant needs to be part of the scientific experiment of the article/trial, as opposed to discussing related work. • Missing Gene: The article/trial does not focus the particular gene in the topic. If the gene is referenced but not part of the study, then it is considered missing. • Missing Variant: The article/trial focuses on the particular gene in the topic, but not the particular variant in the topic. If no variant is provided in the topic, this category should not be assigned.</p><p>• Different Variant: The article/trial focuses on the particular gene in the topic, but on a different variant than the one in the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Demographic</head><p>• Matches: The article/trial demographic population matches the one in the topic.</p><p>• Excludes: The article/trial demographic population specifically excludes the one in the topic.</p><p>• Not Discussed: The article/trial does not discuss a particular demographic population.</p><p>Note that in the 2017 track, an "Other" field was used as well. This was dropped for 2018 because several oncology experts felt it is not a major part of precision medicine decision-making. Additionally, the same assessment tool was used in 2018 as in 2017, which included the Other field. Unfortunately, some assessors on the rare occasion marked Excludes for some results despite the lack of a criteria in the Other field to exclude. This resulted in a small number of downstream results being considered Not Relevant in the official results, but the impact of this issue was fairly minor on the overall scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Relevance Assessment</head><p>Relevance assessment is defined here as the process of mapping the multi-class result assessments described above onto a single numeric relevance scale. This allows for the computation of evaluation metrics (e.g., P@10, infNDCG) as well as the tuning of IR systems to improve their search ranking. As already demonstrated by the need for result assessment above, for the Precision Medicine track the notion of relevance assessment becomes more complex than previous tracks.</p><p>One of the factors that makes precision medicine a difficult domain for IR is that different patient cases require different types of flexibility on the above categories. For some patients, the exact type of cancer is not relevant. Other times, the patient's demographic factors might weigh more heavily. Most notably, the very concept of precision medicine acknowledges the uniqueness of the patient, and so it is to be expected that no perfect match is found. Not only do the topics provided to the participants not contain the necessary information to decide what factors are more/less relevant (e.g., the patient's previous treatments), in many ways it isn't realistic to assign the IR system this responsibility. Precision medicine requires a significant amount of oversight by clinicians, including the ability to consider multiple treatment options. So it might ultimately make the most sense to allow the relevance assessment to be, at least in part, designed by the clinician to allow the IR system to adjust its rankings to suit. Given the constraints of an IR shared task, however, it is necessary to define a fixed relevance assessment process. As such, a fairly broad notion of relevance based on the above categories was used:  2. Partially Relevant: Largely the same as Definitely Relevant, but with the exception that Disease can also be More General and Gene can also be Missing Variant or Different Variant.</p><p>3. Not Relevant: Neither of the above.</p><p>The primary evaluation metrics are precision at rank 10 (P@10), inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG), and R-precision (R-prec). For infNDCG, Definitely Relevant has a score of 2, Partially Relevant is 1, and Not Relevant is 0. In 2017, clinical trials were pooled using a different sampling strategy than literature articles, and therefore had different primary evaluation metrics (P@5, P@10, P@15). However, for the 2018 track the same sampling strategy was used for both tasks and therefore the same primary evaluation metrics apply.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>In total, there were 22,429 judgments for the literature articles and 14,188 judgments for the clinical trials. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,100.49,579.46,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows basic statistics of the results and relevance assessments. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,402.80,579.46,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the number of Definitely Relevant, Partially Relevant, and Not Relevant judgments for each topic. Since each result was judged only once, no inter-rater agreement is available for the judgments.</p><p>There were a total of 27 participants in the track.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>The goal of the Precison Medicine track is to inform the creation of information retrieval systems to support clinicians working in precision medicine (specifically oncologists in this track) in making better treatment decisions for individual patients. Participants were provided with synthetic patient data consisting of a type of cancer, one or more genetic variants, and patient demographics. Given this, participants were challenged with retrieving relevant treatments (in the form of literature articles) and relevant trials (in the form of clinical trial descriptions) for the specific patient. The 2018 track was the second year for the track. This year saw continued high participation numbers, as well as enabling participants to build on systems and results from 2017.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,209.82,177.25,196.59,8.74;4,167.64,65.03,280.95,97.11"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Two-step result assessment process</figDesc><graphic coords="4,167.64,65.03,280.95,97.11" type="bitmap" /></figure>
