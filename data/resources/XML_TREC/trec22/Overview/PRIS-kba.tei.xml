<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper details the participation of Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System lab of BUPT in CCR and SSF task of TREC 2013 Knowledge Base Acceleration track. In the CCR task, The PRIS system focuses attention on query expansion and similarity calculation. The system uses DBpedia as external source data to do query expansion and generates directional documents to calculate similarities with candidate worth citing documents. In the SSF task, The PRIS system utilizes a pattern learning method to do relation extraction and slot filling. Patterns of regular slots which are same to TAC-KBP slots are learned from KBP Slot Filling corpus. Other slots are filled by following some generalized patterns learned from external source data including homepages of some famous people and facilities. Experiments show that the CCR system gives a good performance above the median value. The pattern learning method for SSF task gives an outstanding performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The goal of KBA track is filtering a large stream of text to find documents that can help update a knowledge base like Wikipedia. The KBA2013 includes two tasks: CCR task and SSF task. For the CCR task, given a fixed list of target entities from Wikipedia and Twitter, systems should filter documents worth citing in a profile of the entity. For the SSF task, given a slot for each of the target entities, systems should detect changes to the slot value, such as location of next performance or founder of an organization. Our team participated in both of tasks.</p><p>The PRIS-CCR system focuses attention on query expansion and similarity calculation.</p><p>The PRIS-SSF system utilizes a pattern learning method to do relation extraction and slot filling. We group all slots into two classes. The system learns patterns for the two classes of slots with different training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Cumulative Citation Recommendation task (CCR)</head><p>The CCR system focuses attention on query expansion and similarity calculation. The framework of our system is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,295.38,606.53,4.35,9.58">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Query Expansion</head><p>In the CCR task, we utilize DBpedia and entity supporting documents to do two layers' query expansion. Expansion terms are given tags of Name, Label, Key and Link.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Query Expansion in Class Level</head><p>Based on sources of their supporting documents, the system classifies all entities into two classes: Wikipedia entity and Twitter entity. For entities in the two classes, do query expansion as following:</p><p>For each Wikipedia entity, the system chooses values of property name and values of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DBpedia</head><p>Training data &amp;supporting documents</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directional documents</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,207.18,278.93,5.74,9.58">1</ref> the framework of PRIS system for CCR task property label as expansion terms from the corresponding DBpedia page and label these terms as Name and Label respectively; for each Twitter entity, the system chooses alternative names and the link of homepage as expansion terms from the corresponding twitter page and then visits the homepage to extract key words of homepages as expansion terms too. Here, label alternative names as Label, the link of homepage as Link and key words as Key.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Query Expansion in Type Level</head><p>The system respectively adopts different query expansion methods according to different types of entity. The different methods are described as following:</p><p>For each FAC entity, the system chooses the location and representative features as expansion terms from its corresponding Wikipedia page or homepage and label these terms with the tag of Key; for each ORG entity, the system chooses the chairman or CEO as expansion terms from corresponding Wikipedia page or homepage and label these terms with the tag of Key; for each PER entity, the system chooses the outstanding contributions of the entity from corresponding Wikipedia pages and homepages as expansion terms, such as magnum opuses of a writer, albums of a singer and political offices of a statesman. Then give these terms a tag of Key.</p><p>With the two level query expansions, we label these expansion term set as q e with all expansion terms in. Specially, record the value of Name and Label with the set name e , obviously, name q e e ⊂ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Similarity Calculation</head><p>After query expansion, we next retrieve relevant documents based on these query terms. By computing similarities with directional documents, choose the most similar documents as vital documents for each entity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Retrieval Relevant Documents</head><p>Based on the query expansion terms, we retrieve relevant documents from index. To rank all relevant documents, we reference the work name mention e d is an function which identifies the document d mentions name e</p><p>and is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,141.51,277.33,182.93,42.75">1 if name e d ∩ ≠ ∅ ( , )</formula><p>name mention e d =</p><p>(2) 0 otherwise</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>_ ( , )</head><p>q</p><p>Weighted Score e d denotes the occurrence of q e in d. α and β are the coefficients which assign different weights to different score components to balance their influences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>_ ( , )</head><p>name q name q name e k e k e</p><p>Weigheted Score e d name k</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,282.09,424.79,223.15,30.25">α β ∈ ∈ ∉ = ⋅ + ⋅ ∑ ∑ (3)</formula><p>The condition</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>( , )</head><p>name mention e d checks whether entity e is discussed in d, and the function body</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>_ ( , )</head><p>q</p><p>Weighted Score e d serves as the complementary information to the relevance score under the assumption that the more expansion terms occur in d, the more likely d is relevant to entity e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Directional documents generation</head><p>For each entity, the supporting document and training data include much important information and can be used to judge whether a new document is worth citing or not. The system builds directional documents as the criterion for each entity. The system builds three kinds of directional document: supporting directional document, keywords directional document and expansion directional document. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supporting</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Similarity calculation</head><p>For the purpose of generating final recommended documents from the candidate documents in section 2.2.1, we utilized Jaccard coefficient to calculate the similarity between candidate documents and directional documents of each entity. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. We used a variation of the traditional Jaccard formula for our specific task showing as follows:</p><p>( , ) d demonstrates that the more terms that a candidate document and a directional document share, the bigger of the similarity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Stream Slot Filling (SSF)</head><p>For the SSF task, our system utilizes a pattern learning method to do relation extraction and slot filling. The PRIS system groups all slots into two classes: KBP slots and other slots. Patterns of regular slots which are same to TAC-KBP slots are learned from KBP Slot Filling corpus. Other slots are filled by following some generalized patterns learned from external source data including homepages of some famous people and facilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Pattern Learning Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Trigger words mining</head><p>In information extraction tasks, a specified relation pattern is mostly triggered by some trigger words. So, based on the idea of activation force of Jun Guo [2], we define trigger force as a criterion for trigger words mining. The trigger force is described in details in [3].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Pattern generation Based Trigger Words</head><p>In our system, the type of generated pattern is dependency pattern, which refers to the shortest dependency path centered by trigger words and linking an entity &amp; attribute-value pairs.</p><p>For each slot, retrieval sentences containing trigger words and parse these sentences by using the Stanford Parser to create dependencies in the "collapsedDependency"</p><p>format. Based on these dependencies, let the trigger word as center word and find the shortest path linking to the entity and attribute-value.</p><p>For example, for a given slot CauseOfDeath, suppose trigger words have been extracted as "died", "dies". The sentence "John died of cancer." containing trigger word "died" can be captured. Based on the dependency relationship, we use the shortest connecting path centered by trigger word "died" to represent the relation between them:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,233.77,368.76,139.31,17.16">_ nsubjpass prep of John cancer → ← died</formula><p>Then a dependency pattern can be generated as following: PER: CauseOfDeath &lt;PER&gt; nsubjpass died prep_of &lt;A_disease&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Relation pattern learning</head><p>To minimize semantic drift in both generations of entity-values and patterns, the system proposes a semantic drift analysis algorithm [] .</p><p>After finding candidate patterns, these patterns are ranked according to:</p><p>) extracted with pattern p.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,110.85,510.89,150.29,28.92">) ( ( log ) ( ) ( ) (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Patterns for Other Slots</head><p>For the four other slots different to KBP slots, the system learns some generalized patterns from external source data including homepages of some famous people and facilities. The method is same to pattern leaning method described above without the trigger word mining step.</p><p>For the FAC slot Contact_Meet_Entity, firstly, find the transitional word T which have relation prep with Entity; secondly, find Core words which have relation nsubj with T word; lastly, take the subtree of Core words as the answer for the slot.</p><p>For the PER slot Contact_Meet_PlaceTime, firstly, find the transitional word T which has the relation nsubj with entity; secondly, find Core words which have relation prep or tmod with T word; lastly, check whether the Core words can be connect with preps or not, if can be connect, combine all subtree of Core words as answer; if not, discard all Core words.</p><p>Specially, the core word must be Date or Location for this slot.</p><p>For the slot Affiliate, we just find all related PER or ORG with entities involved in three layer relationship in dependency tree for each entity.</p></div>
