<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With fast development of medical information systems and software, clinical decision support (CDS) systems continue to develop new methods to deal with diverse information coming from heterogeneous sources such as a large volume of electronic medical records (EMRs), patient genomic data, existing genomic pharmaceutical databases, curated disease-specific databases, peer-reviewed research, etc. As an avenue towards advanced clinical decision-making, TREC CDS track focuses on developing new techniques to find medical cases that are useful for patient care from biomedical literature. Meanwhile, given the volume of the existing literature, and the diversity in biomedical field, finding &amp; delivering relevant medical cases for a particular clinical need is a non-trivial task. Moreover, understanding three kinds of different topics (i.e. diagnosis, test, and treatment) and retrieving appropriate biomedical research articles are quite challenging. To address these problems, we propose concept-based document re-ranking approaches to clinical documents. We basically use pseudo relevance feedback for query expansion to retrieve initial relevant documents. In addition, we considered two different concept-based re-ranking approaches which utilize popular external biomedical knowledge resources (i.e. Wikipedia and UMLS) for improving biomedical information retrieval. Our concept-based re-ranking approaches are to bridge the gaps between queries and biomedical research articles in semantic level.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>TREC Clinical Decision Support Track (CDS) aims to investigate techniques for linking medical cases to information that are relevant for patient care from published biomedical literature. The published biomedical literature which can be searched through PubMed is a trustable, comprehensive source for exploratory analysis and clinical decision-making support because it maintains a number of biomedical research articles including various information such as patient demographics, laboratory test results, radiology reports, clinical demonstration, medicine treatment, etc. The task of CDS is to find biomedical research articles published in PubMed Central (PMC) with a given query which requires expertise to make a decision for treating a patient. It provides a PMC collection with 733,138 XML articles and 30 test queries classified into one of three classes: diagnosis, test, and treatment.</p><p>In our participation to CDS, we propose concept-based document re-ranking approaches to retrieval biomedical documents. First, a set of documents are obtained from an initial search. Then, a first stage of re-ranking is performed using pseudo relevance feedback by expanding a query. At the second stage, we devised conceptbased re-ranking approaches that utilize two different external biomedical knowledge resources (i.e. Wikipedia and UMLS) for more accurate biomedical information retrieval. Our concept-based re-ranking approaches are to show the potentials of using external knowledge resources in aspects of understanding the input queries and the retrieved biomedical research articles in semantic level based on the concepts of knowledge resources.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains our proposed approaches in details. Section 3 presents experimental results among different avenues towards effective CDS. In Section 4, we summarize our entire work and introduce future search direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>Our method is to re-rank documents obtained from an initial search with two stages.</p><p>In the first stage, pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) is applied to obtain accurate ranking by expanding a query based on initial search results. In the second stage, conceptbased ranking with two different medical resources are performed. Next subsection describes our method in detail.</p></div>

It is assumed that top-ranked documents 𝐹 = {𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 , … , 𝐷 |𝐹| } in initial search results relevant to a given query and terms in F are useful to modify a query for a better representation. Relevance model (RM) is to estimate a multinomial distribution 𝑝(𝑤|𝑄) that is the likelihood of a term w given a query Q. The first version of relevance model (RM1) is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,186.14,377.04,276.01,78.29">𝑝 𝑅𝑀1 (𝑤|𝑄) = ∑ 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ) ⋅ 𝑝(𝜃 𝐷 |𝑄) 𝐷∈𝐹 = ∑ 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ) ⋅ 𝑝(𝑄|𝜃 𝐷 ) ⋅ 𝑝(𝜃 𝐷 ) 𝑝(𝑄) 𝐷∈𝐹 ∝ ∑ 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ) ⋅ 𝑝(𝜃 𝐷 ) ⋅ 𝑝(𝑄|𝜃 𝐷 ) 𝐷∈𝐹<label>(4)</label></formula><p>RM1 is composed with three components: document prior 𝑝(𝜃 𝐷 ), document weight 𝑝(𝑄|𝜃 𝐷 ), and term weight in a document 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ). In general, 𝑝(𝜃 𝐷 ) is assumed to be a uniform distribution without the knowledge of a document D. 𝑝(𝑄|𝜃 𝐷 ) = ∏ 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ) 𝑐(𝑤,𝑄) 𝑤∈𝑄 indicates the query-likelihood score. 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃 𝐷 ) can be estimated using various smoothing methods such as Dirichlet-smoothing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept-based Ranking</head><p>The key idea of concept-based IR is to find documents by representing them with concepts rather than words. It is a popular solution to deal with synonymy and polysemy problems occur in IR tasks based on bag-of-words representation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,422.95,194.22,10.69,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In general, Wikipedia is utilized as a resource of concepts because it has millions of concepts in the world while UMLS having medical-specific concepts which include SNOMED-CT and MeSH is dominantly used in biomedical IR tasks. We utilized two resources in different ways for concept-based IR.</p><p>Concept mapping with Wikipedia. Wikipedia is utilized as a concept resource. We assumed that a subset of concepts relevant to medical domain in Wikipedia are useful to CDS. To retain useful medical concepts, those belonging to International Classification Diseases (ICD)-10<ref type="foot" coords="4,229.37,306.06,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_1">2</ref> are selected for concept mapping. ICD-10 is a hierarchical classification scheme of diseases and other health problems defined by World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, coverage and granularity of concepts in ICD-10 are assumed to be suitable to CDS. Unfortunately, all concepts of ICD-10 don't exist in Wikipedia. From more than 14,400 ICD-10 concepts, 7,162 concepts are retained since they have an article in Wikipedia. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,308.45,368.27,4.98,8.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a Wikipedia article for ICD-10 concept Cholera. Based on the selected concepts, ranking is performed by scoring documents with concept mapping method introduced in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,287.45,162.18,10.69,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The method is adaption of concept mapping to document clustering with Wikipedia. In our case, we do ranking than clustering with documents. A document is represented by a word vector. Words are stemmed and lower-cased after stop-words are removed using a stop-words list <ref type="foot" coords="5,407.95,195.99,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . The words in the word vector are mapped to ICD-10 concepts. In addition, a category vector can be derived from a concept vector by similar mapping because an article corresponding to a concept has a set of categories at the end of an article as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,424.99,234.21,3.76,8.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This is a decomposition of a document-category matrix into three components, documentword, word-concept, and concept-category matrices, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,412.99,258.21,3.76,8.96">2</ref>. Entries are filled with standard TF-IDF values in document-word matrix while they are filled with modified versions of TF-IDF values for concepts and categories in others. </p></div>

Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,448.66,629.90,11.69,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is utilized as a domain-specific concept resource. It contains about 900,000 biomedical concepts integrating various resources such as the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base. In addition, it also contains the mapping between about 900,000 concepts and over 2 million. Due to the large volume of UMLS, it is often utilized for concept-based IR in biomedical domain <ref type="bibr" coords="6,290.69,186.18,11.52,8.96" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,302.21,186.18,11.52,8.96" target="#b11">12]</ref>. We employ MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="6,413.59,186.18,11.69,8.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to identify UMLS concepts from texts. One characteristic of using MetaMap is that we can take into consideration the negation of concepts. Dealing with negations is an important issue in other research <ref type="bibr" coords="6,217.01,222.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,228.73,222.21,7.81,8.96" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,236.55,222.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,248.27,222.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b13">14]</ref>. We handle the negations of concepts in documents with respect to those in a query while negated concepts are penalized in most of the previous work. Consider a case with a query Q and two candidate documents 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 . Let's suppose that a concept C is contained in Q and the two documents 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 having the same number of occurrences of C. If C in 𝐷 1 is mostly negated while it is mostly affirmed in 𝐷 2 , it is natural to say that the document 𝐷 2 should be ranked higher than the document 𝐷 1 in search results. On the other hand, if C appears in a negated form in Q, 𝐷 1 should be ranked higher than 𝐷 2 . Based on such idea, we propose a strategy for handling the negations of concepts as follows:</p><p>1. If a concept negated in a query appears in a document with affirmation, decrease the score of the document with respect to the query. 2. If a concept negated in a query appears in a document with negations, increase the score of the document with respect to the query 3. Take into account the number of times where a term is affirmed or negated in a document.</p><p>Negations are identified using NegEx <ref type="bibr" coords="6,289.01,430.31,11.69,8.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which is embedded in MetaMap.</p><p>In order to highlight the effect of the proposed strategy, we selected six UMLS semantic types that are often negated in the test queries and used only the UMLS concepts belonging to those types for document re-ranking. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,385.47,466.31,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the selected semantic types. We can see that the selected semantic types do not include those related to qualification such as qualitative concepts, spatial concepts, body location or region. Although MetaMap often proposes groups of concepts for a given phrase <ref type="foot" coords="6,450.10,500.12,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , the characteristics of the selected semantic types allow us to focus on individual concepts rather than groups of concepts. /𝑘 . Here, p represents a phrase that conveys a biomedical concept, and k represents the number of candidates (Meta Mappings) proposed for p. 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓 𝑖,𝑗,𝑝 is the confidence score for the ith concept in jth candidate for p. We merge all the candidates into a single normalized version rather than selecting the most probable one among the candidates. We assumed that MetaMap would produce the same candidates when it is given the same phrase in similar contexts. 𝑁𝑒𝑔 𝑖,𝑗,𝑝 is a term to handle the negations as proposed above. The value is -1 if the ith concept in jth candidate for p is identified as negated, and 1 if affirmed. Concept vector for Q is constructed in the same way. Then, cosine similarity between two concept vectors is computed. A final score is a combination of scores from PRF and the cosine similarity: 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑄, 𝐷) = 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑃𝑅𝐹 (𝑄, 𝐷) + 𝛼 ⋅ 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑄, 𝐷)</p><p>where α &gt; 0 is a weight of the similarity from concept mapping</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,162.47,436.43,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the descriptions of the submitted runs for evaluation. Run1 is obtained using language model with Dirichlet smoothing implemented Lucene. Then, re-ranking with PRF is performed on the initial search results in Run2. Run3, Run4, and Run5 are the results of concept-mapping with Wikipedia and UMLS. In all runs, 1,000 documents for each query are retrieved and re-ranked. For PRF with RM, the numbers of feedback documents and words are set to 10 and 100, respectively. Mixture weights for Dirichlet smoothing (𝜇) and RM (𝛽), are set to 0.1 and 1,500, respectively. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,150.36,643.94,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the performance summary for five runs. We can see that performances of Run2, Run4, and Run5 are improved against Run1 while it is degraded in Run3. We think that the degradation in Run3 comes from improper concept mapping to ICD-10 in Wikipedia. Our restriction of ICD-10 may result in insufficient coverage of concepts (about 7,000 concepts). From Run4 and Run5, concept-mapping to UMLS improves performance. However, they are not high as we expected. We think that these little improvements show the limitation of re-ranking on the initial search. According to our investigation of the initial search, the number of relevant documents is relatively low in the initial search results by comparing the all documents judged as relevant. Thus, it is necessary to perform re-ranking after initial search with query expansion to contain many relevant documents. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>For TREC Clinical Decision Support track, we proposed two different conceptbased re-ranking approaches which utilize Wikipedia and UMLS as a concept resource. We observed small performance improvements from the concept-based reranking by using UMLS (i.e., MetaMap). However, in order to achieve higher performances, a number of issues remained unresolved should be tackled further. As our future work, we plan to develop more effective way to utilizing biomedical knowledge resources and sophisticated negation handing strategy towards advanced concept-based ranking.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,177.86,624.43,235.79,8.10;4,413.59,622.52,3.00,5.40;4,170.13,392.25,264.84,223.45"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
