<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the IRIT lab participation to the 2014 TREC Temporal Summarization track. The goal of the Temporal Summarization track is to develop systems that allow users to efficiently monitor information about events over time. Our proposed method selects relevant documents that are more likely to concern the event, and extracts relevant and novel sentences based on some filters. Obtained results are presented and discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Presentation of the task</head><p>The aim of the Temporal Summarization (TS) track is to develop systems that allow users to efficiently monitor information about events. This year, the track run only one task which requires systems to iterate over a stream corpus in a chronological order and filter relevant and novel sentences to a developing event.</p><p>A specially filtered subset of the full TREC 2014 StreamCorpus<ref type="foot" coords="1,391.38,369.65,3.97,6.50" target="#foot_0">1</ref> was provided. It consists of about 20 million documents from several sources (News, Social, Forum, Blog, etc.) having a size of 559 GB (compressed). Each document is identified by a stream id that consists of two dash-separated parts: timestamp and doc id. This year, 15 topics were evaluated. Each topic represents an event characterized by a title, a Wikipedia URL, a period, a query and a type (accident, storm, bombing, riot, protest, impact event, shooting). For each event, a system should emit a set of timestamped sentences called updates to generate the event summary. Ground truth, called nuggets, corresponds to a set of sentences extracted from Wikipedia by the track annotators. Matching updates to nuggets was done by track assessors. A nugget and an update are matched if they refer to the same information. To evaluate systems effectiveness, track organizers define two metrics: the Expected Latency Gain (ELG) and the Latency Comprehensiveness (LC) which are similar to the traditional IR notions of Precision and Recall (respectively). Systems are ranked based on the harmonic mean between ELG and LC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">IRIT method for temporal summarization</head><p>Our system is based on Algorithm 1 which is similar to the one given in the track guidelines <ref type="foot" coords="1,497.16,581.67,3.97,6.50" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , used as reference in some methods at TREC TS 2013 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,337.32,594.54,10.50,9.96" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,349.50,594.54,7.00,9.96" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Given an event query Q e and its corresponding period (start time t s , end time t e ), our system iterates over the stream corpus in a chronological order, hour by hour (line 2 of the algorithm).</p><p>We can distinguish 3 basic steps: the first one, done just once, build a generic event model containing a bag of weighted terms related to events (line 1 of the algorithm). Step 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively for each hour. In step 2, our system has to decide which documents end for 10:</p><p>end for 11: end for should be kept in order to extract updates (line 3 of the algorithm), and in the last step, it attempts to detect relevant and novel sentences related to the event (line 6 of the algorithm). These steps are detailed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Generic event model</head><p>We hypothesize that updates related to events tend to contain a specific vocabulary of terms independent of the event type (storm, hurricane, bombing, etc.) such as victims, injuries, deaths, emergency, etc. We call these terms keywords. We assume that we can build a generic event model by leveraging a set of nuggets related to a sample of events. Specifically, considering a set of training nuggets N train related to m events, we estimate the generic event model θ E composed of terms t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,249.53,476.33,106.02,26.22">P (t|θ E ) = T F (t, N train ) log( m EF (t) )</formula><p>Where T F (t, N train ) is the term frequency of term t in the training nuggets N train . EF (t) represents the number of events containing term t in at least one nugget. Thus, a term is more weighted when it appears in most of the training events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Document selection</head><p>To reject documents that are more likely to be not relevant, we apply the following filters:</p><p>-Source filter : Based on some analysis done on the last year's results (TS 2013), we noticed that 95% of relevant document (i.e., having at least one relevant sentence) come from one of the following sources: WEBLOG, MAINSTREAM NEWS and news. For this reason, we reject all documents coming from other sources. -Title filter : 95% of relevant document in TS2013 have a title. We therefore reject documents without titles. -Duplication filter : We reject also duplicate documents having the same doc id.</p><p>In each hour, we keep only the topHits filtered documents based on the following score:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,243.62,111.56,117.84,27.46">Score(d, e) = t∈Qe T F (t, d) |d|</formula><p>Where T F (t, d) is the number of occurrences of term t in document d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sentence selection</head><p>In this step, our system parses all sentences of the selected documents. A sentence is worthy to be added to the summary of the event if it fulfills all the following conditions:</p><p>not too verbose, i.e., it contains less than 25 words.</p><p>it matches at least one query term (one term from Q e ).</p><p>it matches at least one keyword from the generic event model θ E .</p><p>is novel, i.e. not similar to recently added sentences in the last novelty window denoted by NW . We consider that sentences S1 and S2 are similar if cos(S1, S2) &gt; 0.5.</p><p>The score of each selected sentence is then the sum of weights of keywords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Submitted runs and results</head><p>In our submitted runs, we used the nuggets of TREC TS 2013 as training data to build the generic event model θ E . In addition, as shown in Results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,236.83,612.52,3.87,9.96" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. We notice that the best results are obtained by considering the top-5 documents in each hour and 30 keywords. In fact, considering the top-10 documents per hour improves the LC (recall) but brings much noise which degrades the ELG (precision) of the system. Moreover, selecting sentences based on the small set of keywords (30 terms) seems to be enough to get a good recall. However, further work are needed to refine the precision of the summarization process. Concerning the novelty detection, considering 5 minutes as novelty window seems to be too short to detect redundant updates. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,101.89,90.18,220.57,175.68"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Algorithm 1 Temporal Summarization algorithm Input: C : Time-ordered corpus Input: Qe : Event query terms Input: ts : Event start time Input: te : Event end time</figDesc><table coords="2,101.89,147.31,212.47,118.55"><row><cell cols="2">Input: Ntrain : Set of training nuggets</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Output: U ← {}</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">1: θE ← BuildGenericEventM odel(Ntrain)</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">2: for h ∈ [toHour(ts), toHour(te)] do</cell></row><row><cell>3:</cell><cell>D h ← getRelevantDocuments(h, Qe, topHits)</cell></row><row><cell>4:</cell><cell>for d ∈ D h do</cell></row><row><cell>5:</cell><cell>for s ∈ d do</cell></row><row><cell>6:</cell><cell>if isU sef ulSentence(s, U ) then</cell></row><row><cell>7:</cell><cell>U.append(u)</cell></row><row><cell>8:</cell><cell>end if</cell></row><row><cell>9:</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
