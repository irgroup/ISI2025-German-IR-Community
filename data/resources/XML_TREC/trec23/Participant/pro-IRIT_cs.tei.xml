Roughly speaking, given a user, the track focuses on travel suggestions (e.g., attraction places, restaurants, pizzeria, etc) based on two dependent relevance criteria: (1) users' interests which consist of his personal preferences and past history; (2) his geographical location.</p><p>For the sake of addressing this challenge, we used the open web to search for relevant places according to the given contexts of the track. This track was an opportunity for us to test a previous approach on multidimensional (personalized) relevance combination <ref type="bibr" coords="1,267.50,486.79,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,279.68,486.79,7.01,8.74" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The aggregating operator proposed here is able to offer insight to humans about why some relevance criteria were weighted more highly than other ones and is able to personalize the majority preference regarding the IR task specificity as well as the user preferences.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our approach for the retrieval of contextual suggestions. In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the used data, the experimental setup and we discuss the obtained results. Section 5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Contextual Retrieval Framework</head><p>We address here the contextual retrieval problem as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. The difficulty here is to: (i) correctly identifying which criterion need to be enhanced vs. weakened regarding both user's preference and context; and to (ii) accurately combining these criteria. We rely on the Choquet operator as an aggregation operator. This mathematical function is built on a fuzzy measure µ, defined below. Let I C be the set of all possible subsets of criteria from C.</p><p>A fuzzy measure is a normalized monotone function µ from I C to [0 . . . 1] such that: ∀I C1 , I C2 ∈ I C , if (I C1 ⊆ I C2 ) then µ(I C1 ) ≤ µ(I C2 ), with µ(I ∅ ) = 0 and µ(I C ) = 1. µ(I Ci ) will be denoted by µ Ci . The value of µ C1 can be interpreted as the importance degree of the interaction between the criteria involved in the subset C 1 . The personalized Choquet integral based-relevance aggregation function is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,134.76,261.15,53.92,13.32">RSV u C (q, d j )</formula><p>is the d j document personalized relevance score for user u w.r.t the set of relevance criteria C = {c 1 , c 2 } defined as follows:</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,201.54,294.78,212.27,46.61">RSV u C (q, d j ) = Ch µ (RSV u c1 (q, d j ), RSV u c2 (q, d j )) = 2 ∑ i=1 µ u {ci,...,cN } .(rsv u (i)j -rsv u (i-1)j )</formula><p>Where Ch µ is the Choquet function, rsv u (i)j is the i th element of the permutation of RSV (q, d j ) on criterion c i , such that (0 ≤ rsv u (1)j ≤ ... ≤ rsv u (N )j ), µ u {ci,...,cN } is the importance degree of the set of criteria {c i , ..., c N } for user u. In this way, we are able to automatically adjust the ranking model's parameters for each user and make results dependent on its preferences over the considered criteria. Note that if µ is an additive measure, the Choquet integral corresponds to the weighted mean.</p><p>Considering a user, the typical training data required for learning the criteria importance for each user requires a set of training queries and for each query, a list of ranked documents represented by pre-computed vectors containing performance scores; where each document is annotated with a rank label (e.g., relevant or irrelevant). The general methodology is detailed in figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,404.81,485.35,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As most of required information are not present in the TREC collection, we are based on a basic idea, which assign all users the same preferences. However, based on an analysis on the TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion track data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.25,521.22,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we have found that for most contexts, the users preferences criterion is more important than localisation. Therefore, we assign importance degrees equals to 0.7 and 0.3 for both criteria respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Preparation and Indexing</head><p>To fetch for the candidate suggestion places, we crawl the open web through the Google Place API<ref type="foot" coords="2,230.48,638.06,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">4</ref> . As for most of the TREC Contextual Suggestion track participants, we start by querying the Google Place API with the appropriate queries corresponding to every context based on the location. This API returns up to 60 suggestions, thus, we search again with different parameters, like place types that are relevant to the track (e.g., restaurant, cafe, museum, etc.). Beyond the type of the place, we have also give the latitude and longitude as parameters to Google places to obtain results w.r.t the searched context. To obtain the document scores w.r.t the geolocalisation criterion, we compute the distance between the retrieved places and the context, whereas we exploit the cosine similarity between the candidate suggestions description and the user profile to compute the user interest score. User profiles are represented by vectors of terms constructed from his personal preferences on the example suggestions. The description of a place is the result snippet returned by the search engine Google<ref type="foot" coords="3,165.00,432.63,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">5</ref> when the URL of the place is issued as a query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Runs and Evaluation Results</head><p>The TREC 2014 Contextual suggestion data set which includes the following characteristics:</p><p>-Users: The total number of users is 115. Each user is represented by a profile reflecting his preferences for places in a list of 100 example suggestions. An example suggestion is an attraction place expected to be interesting for the user. The preferences, given on a 5-point scale, are attributed for each place description including a title, a brief narrative description and a URL website.</p><p>Positive preferences are those having a relevance judgment degree of about 3 or 4 w.r.t the above features. Ratings of 0 and 1 on example suggestions are viewed as non relevant and those of 2 are considered as neutral. -Contexts and queries: A list of 100 contexts is provided, where each context corresponds to a particular city location, described with longitude and latitude parameters. Given a pair of user and context which represents a query, the aim of the task is to provide a list of 50 ranked suggestions satisfying as much as possible the considered both relevance criteria. -Relevance assessments: Relevance assessments of this task are made by both users and NIST assessors. The user corresponding to each profile, judged suggestions in the same way as examples, assigning a rating of 0 -4 for each title/description and URL, whereas NIST assessors judged suggestions in term of geographical appropriateness on a 3-point scale (2, 1 and 0). A suggestion is relevant if it has a relevance degree of about 3 or 4 w.r.t user interests (profile) and a rating of about 1 or 2 for geolocalisation criterion.</p><p>In the present work, we followed the guidelines described in the TREC website <ref type="bibr" coords="4,134.76,246.04,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and we submitted only one run. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,325.96,246.04,4.98,8.74">1</ref> shows the retrieval performances obtained using our operator. From Table <ref type="table" coords="4,322.03,257.99,3.87,8.74">1</ref>, we can see that the performance of our approach w.r.t the measure P @5 is about 0.21 whereas it is about 0.33. P @5 measures the number of relevant suggestions within the top-5 results for which the user preferred a document satisfying both the description and the geographical location criteria. As described in the track guidelines, the M RR score is computed as 1/k, where k is the rank of the first relevant attraction found, while T BG uses the time for measuring effectiveness.
