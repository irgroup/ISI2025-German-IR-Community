<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, we present our participation in the microblog track in TREC-2014, building upon our first participation last year. We present our approaches for the two tasks of this year: temporally-anchored ad-hoc search and tweet timeline generation. For the ad-hoc search task, we used topical expansion in addition to temporal models to perform retrieval. Our results show that our run based on the typical pseudo relevance feedback query expansion outperformed all of our other runs with a relatively high mean average precision (MAP). As for the timeline generation task, we approached this problem using online incremental clustering of tweets retrieved for a given query. Our approach allows the dynamic creation of "semantic" clusters while providing a framework for detecting redundant tweets and selecting representative ones to be added to the final timeline. The results demonstrate that using incremental clustering of tweets retrieved through a temporal retrieval model produced the best effectiveness among the submitted runs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Miroblogging services such as Twitter are attracting users looking to engage in vibrant and influential hubs for information sharing and finding. With hundreds of millions of tweets posted daily, a large number of queries are issued seeking information. Recent studies on Twitter data have emphasized the high temporality of information published through Twitter, mostly covering breaking news and events <ref type="bibr" coords="1,242.59,512.47,9.71,7.86" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,255.34,512.47,10.73,7.86" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Such temporality of the data is also reflected in searching behavior over tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="1,102.55,533.40,13.49,7.86" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, making it essential for a microblog search system to consider such characteristic of the data and the task. In addition, the very short length of queries (e.g., average of 3.76 words in this year's microblog ad-hoc search task at TREC-2014) and tweets (with 140-character of maximum length) makes searching for tweets a challenging task.</p><p>Due to these factors, a microblog search system should consider temporal signals in tweets and queries in addition to augmenting their context to improve retrieval. In this work, we aim at studying the effectiveness of retrieval given these two main factors: temporality and context. We specifically study ad-hoc search given three types of retrieval models:</p><p>(1) a purely temporal model, (2) a query expansion model, Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.</p><p>TREC '14 Gaithersburg, Maryland USA and (3) a model that combines both temporal and query expansion factors to perform search.</p><p>Given the huge number of tweets that can be retrieved using a query, presenting a long list of tweets to a user on a given information need might not be plausible anymore; the amount of tweets the user has to go through about a topic can be overwhelming <ref type="bibr" coords="1,431.15,283.83,13.49,7.86" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Minimizing tweet redundancy and irrelevancy can help provide a user with more informative and compact list of tweets on a topic of interest. Continuous clustering algorithms are among the most commonly-used methods to bring summarized tweet timelines to a user <ref type="bibr" coords="1,377.82,336.13,14.31,7.86" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,395.68,336.13,10.74,7.86" target="#b19">20]</ref>. In such approaches, online clustering, usually supported by near-duplicate detection, is used to extract representative tweets of a large stream of tweets on an ongoing topic. We employ these ideas to design a tweet timeline generation system that accepts a temporallyanchored query and provides the user with a timeline of nonredundant, chronologically-ordered tweets posted before the query time.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss our approach to the temporally-anchored ad-hoc search task in addition to the evaluation results in Section 2. Section 3 describes how we tackled the problem of tweet timeline generation (TTG) along with the evaluation results. We conclude this paper with Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">AD-HOC SEARCH</head><p>The temporally-anchored ad-hoc search task is one of the microblog track tasks at TREC that continued since 2011 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,543.51,521.17,14.31,7.86" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,316.81,531.63,11.76,7.86" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,331.68,531.63,10.74,7.86" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Given a free-text query issued at a given time, this task aims to retrieve timely relevant tweets for that query. To perform this task, we leverage retrieval models based on two main intuitions. First, due to the temporality of the task and the data, temporal retrieval models might be effective in this task as demonstrated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="1,535.31,583.93,9.72,7.86" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,548.76,583.93,7.16,7.86" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,316.81,594.39,11.76,7.86" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,332.08,594.39,6.48,7.86" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Second, the very short length of tweets and queries can impede effective retrieval which motivated utilizing context expansion methods in microblog ad-hoc search <ref type="bibr" coords="1,522.22,615.32,9.72,7.86" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,534.47,615.32,7.16,7.86" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,544.16,615.32,11.77,7.86" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,316.81,625.78,10.74,7.86" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In total, we work with three retrieval models described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Retrieval Models</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Query Likelihood (QL)</head><p>All of the models we use in this work benefit from the Query Likelihood (QL) model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,441.32,700.73,14.32,7.86" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in retrieval. This model ranks documents by the likelihood that their language mod-els generated the query as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,124.10,76.18,168.81,7.86">P (D|Q) ∝ P (Q|D)P (D) (1)</formula><p>where D is a document and Q is the query. Assuming a uniform document prior P (D) and terms independence, documents can be ranked by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,104.36,135.89,188.55,17.80">P (D|Q) ∝ P (Q|D) = w∈Q P (w|D)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>more specifically, we use the log-likelihoods to rank documents by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,141.94,192.46,150.97,17.80">w∈Q log P (w|D)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where P (w|D) is computed using maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) with Dirichlet smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.24,229.28,14.31,7.86" target="#b24">[25]</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,115.22,247.33,177.69,19.75">P (w|D) = tfw,D + µP (w|C) |D| + µ<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where tfw,D is the term frequency of w in D, P (w|C) is estimated using MLE over the collection C and the smoothing factor µ is a free parameter for this retrieval model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Time-based Exponential Priors (t-EXP)</head><p>The t-EXP model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.44,331.69,14.32,7.86" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is a temporal variation of the QL model in which an exponential decay factor is used as a document prior as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,114.87,368.89,178.04,10.13">P (D|Q) ∝ P (Q|D) • r • e -r.t d<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where r is a decay rate factor, and t d is the posting time difference in days between D and Q. As with the QL model, we rank documents using log-likelihoods by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="2,108.36,428.60,184.54,20.06">w∈Q log P (w|D) + log r • e -r.t d (6)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Time-based Query Relevance Modeling (t-QRM)</head><p>t-QRM <ref type="bibr" coords="2,94.61,485.45,9.72,7.86" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is a variant of the typical query relevance modeling approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.38,495.91,9.72,7.86" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that uses a temporal query relevance model computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="2,111.32,526.61,177.67,17.80">P (w|Q) = t∈T P (w|t, Q)P (t|Q) (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="2,288.99,526.61,3.92,7.86">)</formula><p>where t is a timestamp in unit of days and T is the set of timestamps in the collection. Given an initially-retrieved list R k retrieved using the QL model, we estimate P (t|Q) as the normalized sum of retrieval scores of documents posted within t. The probability P (w|t, Q) can be computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="2,104.71,622.69,188.20,17.80">P (w|t, Q) = D∈t P (w|D)P (D|t, Q)<label>(8)</label></formula><p>P (D|t, Q) is assumed to be uniform over all documents in R k posted within t. P (w|D) is computed using the MLE. Once P (w|Q) is computed for all terms in R k , we expand the query with the m terms with the highest probability. Given the expanded query, the final results are retrieved using the typical QL model. Both the initial list size k and the number of expansion terms m are free parameters for this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">PRF-based Query Expansion (QE)</head><p>Earlier work on microblog search showed that query expansion with Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,509.45,81.05,9.72,7.86" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has good effectiveness in this task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.46,91.51,14.31,7.86" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.52,91.51,7.16,7.86" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.43,91.51,10.74,7.86" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In typical PRF-based retrieval, a query is expanded using the m top-scoring terms extracted from an initially retrieved list R k given Q. In this work, we used a tf -idf <ref type="bibr" coords="2,417.15,122.89,14.32,7.86" target="#b12">[13]</ref> like scoring function to score terms over all documents in R k as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="2,374.53,151.42,181.39,9.49">Score(w, R k ) = tfw,R k • idf (w) (9)</formula><p>tfw,R k is the term frequency of w in R k and idf (w) is the inverse document frequency of w computed as idf (w) = log N dfw . Once we expand the query with m terms, we use the QL model to retrieve the final list of documents using the expanded query. Both m and k are free parameters for this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Evaluation Setup</head><p>Similar to last year, the track used the Tweets13 collection of approximately 243 million tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.80,270.93,13.50,7.86" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Participants can access and retrieve tweets from this collection by submitting a query to the track-provided API<ref type="foot" coords="2,457.72,290.09,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.47,291.86,13.49,7.86" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Given the query, the API returns a list of tweets using the QL retrieval model from the Tweets13 collection. Participants can then use their own retrieval model to process this list and produce a final one.</p><p>Evaluation of the 2014 ad-hoc search task is performed given a list of 55 new topics released with Tweets13. We submitted four official runs based on three retrieval models (discussed in Section 2.1): PRF-based query expansion, t-EXP and t-QRM. We tuned the parameters of these retrieval models using 60 topics released with the microblog track in TREC-2013 with the Tweets13 collection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.63,406.92,13.49,7.86" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We also removed retweets and non-English tweets from result lists; language of a tweet is detected using an open-source language detection tool<ref type="foot" coords="2,410.93,436.54,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . We evaluated retrieval using precision at rank 30 (P@30) and mean average precision (MAP) that were the primary evaluation measures used in previous runs of this task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.49,469.69,14.32,7.86" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.87,469.69,11.76,7.86" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,417.69,469.69,10.74,7.86" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Experimental Results</head><p>We present each of our four officially-submitted runs in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,343.46,514.17,4.61,7.86">1</ref> below. Whenever the QL model is used, we set µ = 1000. <ref type="foot" coords="2,357.40,522.87,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_2">3</ref> We present results on retrieval effectiveness of  <ref type="table" coords="2,397.15,643.17,3.58,7.86" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. We also compare the performance of our official runs to two baselines:</p><p>• Baseline14: a run based on the underlying retrieval model of the common API, i.e., Lucene's implementation of query likelihood model with Dirichlet smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="3,91.55,89.02,13.49,7.86" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>• Median: The median retrieval results of all automatic runs submitted to this task. We notice that our runs had better MAP compared to both baselines. However, only the two runs based on prf-based query expansion had significantly higher MAP than Base-line14. Moreover, these two runs along with QUTQRM had significantly better effectiveness compared to the median run. Interestingly, we see that only one run had better P@30 than Baselien14. Overall, 3 out of 4 runs had a slightly higher P@30 than the median, and as with MAP, the improvement was significant with QUQueryExp5D25T run.</p><p>The results showed that the non-temporal run QUQuery-Exp5D25T had the best performance on both measures compared to other runs and baselines. This shows that the typical and rather simple prf-based QE is an effective retrieval approach with microblog ad-hoc search.</p><p>As for temporal models, we see that the run QUTmpDecay has almost the same performance as Baseline14. This is not surprising since the retrieval model t-EXP is based on the QL model but using a temporal decay factor as a document prior. This might indicate that using such prior did not help in capturing the temporal aspect of the data and the task. The QUTQRM run had almost the same P@30 compared to Baseline14 but it notably improved MAP suggesting it helped improve the overall ranking of tweets, but not necessarily the top 30 ones. To understand the behavior of such models in relation to the given queries, analysis of the temporal nature of queries is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">TWEET TIMELINE GENERATION</head><p>Timeline generation is a new task that has been just introduced this year at the microblog track. It aims at producing a timeline of non-redundant chronologically-ordered tweets that are relevant to a given query issued at time qt. The timeline basically constitutes a summary for a topic (e.g., event) represented by the given query. The definition of the task inherently imposes the need for an initial list of "potentially-relevant" tweets, which indicates that the new task is highly-dependent on the quality of the retrieval result list Rq (and thus the retrieval model used to retrieve those results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Online Clustering Approach</head><p>This year, we adopted a simple online-clustering technique <ref type="bibr" coords="3,341.32,81.05,9.71,7.86" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to detect sub-events that are not redundant before producing the final timeline for a given query. The rationale behind this technique is that we need to detect such clusters without determining their number in advance. In online-clustering, the data to be clustered is processed in a stream, where the incoming data can either be added to an existing cluster or form a new cluster, thus having a dynamic set of clusters. The approach pipeline illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,542.40,154.27,4.61,7.86" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is outlined as follows:</p><p>1. Ad-hoc Retrieval: Given the query q at time qt, a ranked list of 1000 tweets is retrieved using model m.</p><p>2. Duplicate Removal: Duplicates (or near-duplicates) of tweets were removed from the retrieval results by normalizing the tweets (i.e., removing stop words, URLs, and mentions) and then hashing the normalized tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="3,555.43,243.84,13.50,7.86" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>3. Tweet Streaming: Only the top k tweets were considered for timeline generation after removing the nearduplicates. Retrieval results are ordered in some criterion (e.g., chronologically, or based on retrieval scores) to form a stream of k tweets. The algorithm then processes the stream, one tweet at a time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Clustering:</head><p>We then construct clusters that represent "sub-topics" by processing the tweet stream. Initially, there are no clusters. Each incoming tweet is either added to an existing cluster if it exhibits a high similarity to it, or forms a new cluster if none of the existing ones were similar. Similarity between a tweet and a cluster can be measured in different ways, e.g., similarity between the tweet and the cluster's centroid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Cluster Filtering: Singleton clusters (i.e., clusters of only one tweet) can optionally be filtered out (i.e., not represented in the timeline) as they might be outliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Tweet Selection:</head><p>After clustering all tweets in the stream, each cluster elects one or more tweets to represent it in the final timeline. There are several ways to select such tweets, e.g., the tweet that is most similar to the centroid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Baseline</head><p>Since the retrieved tweets that appear in the tweet stream above can (by definition) represent a timeline, we used that list as a beseline approach to which we compare our online clustering approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Submitted Runs</head><p>Prior to TREC, the track organizers shared with the participants a small training set based on 10 queries from Tweets11 collection. We have conducted preliminary experiments using that set with different configurations and parameters for each of the steps of the proposed approach. We eventually chose the 4 runs described in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,461.98,650.31,3.58,7.86">3</ref>.</p><p>Two submitted runs (indicated by BL postfix) are based on the baseline approach using two different retrieval models. The other two (indicated by CL postfix) used the online clustering approach with two other different retrieval models as well. In all of the submitted runs:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ad-hoc retrieval</head><note type="other">Duplicate</note><p>• The top 75 tweets were selected after duplicate detection to form the tweet stream.</p><p>• The most similar tweet to the query in a cluster (i.e., the one with highest relevance score, which might generally change over the course of stream processing) acted as its centroid and hence the cluster similarity with any incoming tweet was measured by the similarity between the incoming tweet and the most relevant tweet. That tweet was eventually selected as the representative of the cluster in the timeline.</p><p>• Singleton clusters were not filtered out.</p><p>• Cosine similarity was used as the similarity function. A similarity threshold of 0.6 was used to guide clustering decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation Setup</head><p>The same 55 queries used in the ad-hoc search task were also used in the TTG task. The submitted runs in the adhoc task consitututed the judgment pool for TTG as well. An additional round of manual judgments was performed on the tweets that were judged as relevant to each query to form semantic clusters containing redundant tweets.</p><p>System efffectiveness is measured using cluster precision and two versions of cluster recall. Cluster precsion P is defined as the percentage of distinct semantic clusters that are represented in the generated timeline out of the tweets in that timeline. The unweighted veriosn of cluster recall RU is defined as the percentage of distinct semantic clusters that are represented in the generated timeline out of the judged semantic clusters. The weighted version RW weights the semantic clusters based on the aggregate relevance levels of the tweets included in each cluster. <ref type="foot" coords="4,206.88,611.72,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_3">4</ref> Two versions of F1 are then used as the figure of merit, F 1U and F 1W .  <ref type="table" coords="4,355.76,402.52,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_1">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,383.38,402.52,4.61,7.86">5</ref> show the performance of our submitted TTG runs in the measures described earlier. P and R indicate the average precision and recall respectively over all queries. F1 is just computed using the average precision and corresponding avarage recall, not as an average F1 over all queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Experimental Results</head><p>The results show that, while the baseline approach had better recall (as it maximizes the number of represented clusters), the online clustering approach exhibited better precision (as it avoids redundant tweets/clusters) and thus better F1 values. Moreover, the exponential-decay-based model had better F1 values than the PRF-based QE model. More experiments and analysis of the results are needed to explain the reason behind that. We also notice that the F1 values are relatively low, which shows either the difficulty of the problem or the opportunity for improvements.</p><p>No median results per query (across participants) were shared by the track organizers, however, F1 results of all anonymous submmited runs from all participants (about 45 runs) were shared and illustrated in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="4,507.19,601.28,4.61,7.86" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="4,535.73,601.28,4.61,7.86">3</ref> for unweighted and weighted versions respectively. In both figures, F1 values of QU runs were circled and the best of them was marked by the corresponding precision and recall values. In both cases, the best QU run was ranked among the top 10 (or probably 11) submitted runs, while all of them were ranked better than the median submitted run. This indicates the potential of the online clustering approach for tweet timeline generation problem. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Continuing from our last year participation in the track <ref type="bibr" coords="5,281.51,314.80,9.20,7.86" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we again turned to context expansion-based retrieval models to perform ad-hoc search. We used two query expansion retrieval models, one that is the typical prf-based and the other uses temporal aspects of the query in selecting expansion terms. Furthermore, we retrieve tweets using a temporal model that was found effective in this context. The results showed the superiority of prf-based query expansion retrieval over all other retrieval models we used.</p><p>In our work on the TTG task, we employed the same retrieval models used in ad-hoc search to retrieve tweets for a given query. Online clustering of tweets with the help of near-duplicate detection was then used to produce a timeline for a given query. The results showed that clustering of tweets retrieved through the temporal query expansion retrieval model had the best effectiveness compared to our other TTG runs. Based on F1 measure, this run was also ranked among the top 10 runs submitted to this task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,316.81,555.09,239.11,7.89;2,316.81,565.55,20.34,7.89;2,333.31,574.36,19.73,7.89;2,434.41,574.36,29.33,7.89;2,480.54,574.36,52.89,7.89;2,333.31,585.35,82.63,7.86;2,431.30,585.35,100.44,7.86;2,333.31,596.31,57.94,7.86;2,435.87,596.31,26.41,7.86;2,477.61,596.31,33.08,7.86;2,333.31,607.27,203.04,7.86;2,333.31,618.23,43.11,7.86;2,434.40,618.23,97.35,7.86;2,316.81,643.17,77.23,7.86"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Description of our ad-hoc search official runs</figDesc></figure>
