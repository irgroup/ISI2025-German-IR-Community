<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The characteristics of Web search environment, namely the document characteristics and the searcher behavior on the Web, confound the problems of Information Retrieval (IR). The massive, heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed Web document collection as well as the unpredictable and less than ideal querying behavior of a typical Web searcher exacerbate conventional IR problems and diminish the effectiveness of retrieval approaches proven in the laboratory conditions of traditional IR. At the same time, the Web is rich with various sources of information that go beyond the contents of documents, such as document characteristics, hyperlinks, Web directories (e.g. Yahoo), and user statistics.</p><p>Fusion IR studies have repeatedly shown that combining multiple sources of evidence can improve retrieval performance. Furthermore, the nature of the Web search environment is such that retrieval approaches based on single sources of evidence suffer from weaknesses that can hurt the retrieval performance in certain situations. For example, content-based IR approaches have difficulty dealing with the diversity in vocabulary and quality of web documents, while link-based approaches can suffer from incomplete or noisy link topology. The inadequacies of singular Web IR approaches coupled with the fusion hypothesis (i.e. "fusion is good for IR") make a strong argument for combining multiple sources of evidence as a potentially advantageous retrieval strategy for Web IR.</p><p>Among the various source of evidence on the Web, we focused our TREC-10 efforts on leveraging document text and hyperlinks, and examined the effects of combining result sets as well as those of various evidence source parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Text-based Method: VSM</head><p>The text-based retrieval component of the experiment was based on a Vector Space Model (VSM) using the SMART length-normalized term weights as implemented in IRIS<ref type="foot" coords="1,474.76,564.73,3.48,6.26" target="#foot_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.36,567.14,40.75,9.94;1,90.04,579.86,85.67,9.94" target="#b18">(Yang &amp; Maglaughlin, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>

The simple plural remover was chosen to speed up indexing time and to minimize the overstemming effect of more aggressive stemmers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Term Indexes</head><p>In addition to body text terms (i.e. terms between &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt; tags), IRIS extracted header text terms from document titles, meta keyword and description texts, and heading texts (i.e. texts between &lt;Hn&gt; and &lt;/Hn&gt; tags). A combination of body and header text terms was also created, where the header text terms were emphasized by multiplying the term frequencies by 10.</p><p>In each of the three term sources, adjacent noun phrases were identified to construct noun phrase indexes as well as single term indexes. By using an online dictionary and the punctuationbased phrase window recognition algorithm, IRIS defined an adjacent noun phrase as consisting of up to three adjacent dictionary nouns or capitalized words within a phrase window.</p></div>

Top ten positive and top two negative weighted terms from the top three ranked documents of the initial retrieval results were used to expand the initial query in a pseudofeedback retrieval process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">VSM systems</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,118.37,538.46,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref> enumerates the text-based method parameters for VSM systems, which are query length, term source, use of phrase terms, and use of pseudo-feedback. Query length range from short (topic title) and medium (topic title and description) to long (topic title, description, and narrative). Term sources are body text, header text, and body plus header text. The combination of parameters (3 query lengths, 3 term sources, 2 for phrase use, 2 for feedback use) resulted in 36 VSM systems. where $qform = query length (s, m, l) $index = term source (b, h, bh) $phrase = noun phrase (0, 1) $feedback = pseudo-feedback (1, 2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Link-based Method: HITS</head><p>Among the several possible link-based retrieval methods, the authority scores of documents computed by the HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,252.18,269.06,81.70,9.94" target="#b10">(Kleinberg, 1997)</ref> were used to generate a ranked list of documents with respect to a given query. PageRank scores <ref type="bibr" coords="3,361.61,281.78,82.77,9.94" target="#b13">(Page et al., 1998)</ref> could be used to rank documents as well, but effectiveness computation of PageRank scores is likely to require a much larger set of linked documents than WT10g corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="3,362.13,307.10,94.32,9.94">(Brin &amp; Page, 1998)</ref>. The Clever algorithm that extends HITS by incorporating the text around links into the computation of hub and authority scores has been shown to improve the performance of HITS <ref type="bibr" coords="3,436.66,332.30,85.53,9.94;3,90.04,345.02,23.84,9.94">(Chakrabarti et al., 1998)</ref>. However, Clever combines link-and text-based methods implicitly and thus makes it difficult to isolate the contributions and behaviors of individual methods, which we wanted to study to better understand the effect of combining retrieval result sets. HITS defines "authority" as a page that is pointed to by many good hubs and defines "hub" as a page that points to many good authorities. Mathematically, these circular definitions can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,136.72,428.70,182.26,29.03">∑ → = p q q h p a ) ( ) ( ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,136.72,456.66,177.95,29.03">∑ → = q p q a p h ) ( ) ( . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,314.67,464.54,4.31,9.94">)</formula><p>The above equations define the authority weight a(p) and the hub weight h(p) for each page p, where p→q denote "page p has a hyperlink to page q". HITS starts with a root set S of text-based search engine results in response to a query about some topic, expands S to a base set T with the inlinks and outlinks of S, eliminates links between pages with the same domain name in T to define the graph G, runs the iterative algorithm (equations 2 and 3) on G until convergence, and returns a set of documents with high h(p) weights (i.e. hubs) and another set with high a(p) weights (i.e. authorities). The iterative algorithm works as follows: Starting with all weights initialized to 1, each step of the iterative algorithm computes h(p) and a(p) for every page p in T, normalizes each of them so that the sum of the squares adds up to 1, and repeats until the weights stabilize. In fact it can be shown that the authority weights at convergence correspond to the principal eigenvalues of A T A and hub weights correspond to those of AA T , where A is the link matrix of the base set T 4 . Typically, convergence occurs in 10 to 50 iterations for T consisting of about 5000 Web pages, expanded from the root set S of 200 pages while being constrained by the expansion limit of 50 inlinks per page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Modified HITS Algorithm</head><p>The original HITS algorithm was modified by adopting a couple of improvements from other HITS-based approaches. As implemented in the ARC algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,387.64,150.26,112.45,9.94">(Chakrabarti et al., 1998)</ref>, the root set was expanded by 2 links instead of 1 link (i.e. expand S by all pages that are 2 link distance away from S). Also, the edge weights by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,347.33,175.58,137.12,9.94" target="#b0">Bharat and Henzinger (1998)</ref>, which essentially normalize the contribution of authorship by dividing the contribution of each page by the number of pages created by the same author, was used to modify the HITS formulas as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,136.72,233.94,249.95,29.03">) , ( _ ) ( ) ( p q wt auth q h p a p q × = ∑ → , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="4,136.72,241.82,254.26,49.22">) ) , ( _ ) ( ) ( q p wt hub q a p h q p × = ∑ → .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>In above equations, auth_wt(q,p) is 1/m for page q, whose host has m documents pointing to p, and hub_wt(p,q) is 1/n for page q, which is pointed by n documents from the host of p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Host Definitions</head><p>To compute the edge weights of modified HITS algorithm, one must first establish a definition of a host to identify the page authorship (i.e. documents belonging to a given host are created by the same author). Though host identification heuristics employing link analysis might be ideal, we opted for simplistic host definitions based on URL lengths. Short host form was arrived at by truncating the document URL at the first occurrence of a slash mark (i.e. '/'), and long host form from the last occurrence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">HITS systems</head><p>Among the 36 text-based system results, we chose the best performing system with all variations of query lengths. The combination of host definition and seed set parameters, as seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,516.80,497.18,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref> below, resulted in 6 HITS systems. where $hform = host definition (s, l) $seed = seed set (sb1.1, mb1.1, lb1.1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Fusion Method</head><p>Since it is not clear from literature how much can be gained by using one fusion method over another, the Similarity Merge method <ref type="bibr" coords="4,264.48,704.54,88.50,9.94">(Fox &amp; Shaw, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,352.98,704.54,34.65,9.94" target="#b6">, 1994)</ref> was chosen for its simplicity and consideration of overlap, which is thought to be an important factor in fusion. Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,513.71,74.42,4.26,9.94" target="#formula_7">6</ref>) below describes the fusion formula used to merge and rank documents retrieved by different systems:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="5,118.84,125.90,164.09,11.33">FS = (∑NS i )*overlap,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where: FS = fusion score of a document, NS i = normalized score of a document by method i, overlap = number of methods that retrieved a given document.</p><p>The normalized document score, NS i , is computed by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,346.26,191.78,137.77,9.94">Lee's min-max formula (1996</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,493.73,191.78,23.70,9.94">Lee's min-max formula ( , 1997))</ref>, where S i is the retrieval score of a given document and S max and S min are the maximum and minimum document scores by method i.</p><p>NS i = (S i -S min ) / (S max -S min ), ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,274.36,245.06,4.31,9.94">7</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Although various fusion combinations were tried, combining retrieval result sets did not improve on the performance of the best text-based method. In fact, fusion in general seemed to decrease retrieval performance, which is contrary to previous fusion research findings that suggest that combining results of various retrieval methods is beneficial to retrieval performance. Curiously enough, past TREC participants who tried fusion with WT10g corpus also found that combining text-and link-based methods did not improve retrieval performance <ref type="bibr" coords="5,472.48,366.62,49.69,9.94;5,90.04,379.22,69.94,9.94" target="#b16">(Singhal &amp; Kaszkiel, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,163.60,379.22,114.82,9.94" target="#b9">Gurrin &amp; Smeaton, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,282.03,379.22,112.81,9.94" target="#b14">Savoy &amp; Rasolofo, 2001)</ref>. Whether this is simply an artifact of the WT10g test collection (i.e. link structure, relevance judgments, query characteristics) or the reflection of real inadequacies present in link analysis and/or fusion methods remains the main focus in our ongoing investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Single System Results</head><p>The best performing VSM system, measured by average precision of 0.1406, was vsmlb1.1 (long query, body text, noun phrase, no feedback). The best HITS system was hitslb1.1 (short host, seed set system of vsmlb1.1) with average precision of 0.0399. The best text-based system not only outperformed the best link-based system (3.5 times better in average precision), but also outperformed all other systems, both single and fusion, as can be seen in subsequent sections.</p><p>Examination of single system results (Table <ref type="table" coords="5,339.06,531.02,4.61,9.94" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) reveals some interesting phenomena regarding the effects of individual system parameters on retrieval performance. According to Table <ref type="table" coords="5,118.13,556.34,4.15,9.94" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, the system parameters most influential to retrieval performance seem to be index source, query length, and host definition. VSM systems using header terms only show markedly worse performance than systems using body text terms, and longer query length systems generally perform better than shorter query systems using the same index source terms. The shorter host definition is obviously far superior to longer definition (over 13 times better in average precision) for HITS systems.</p><p>In post analysis, we constructed optimum seed sets from known relevant documents to ascertain the maximum performance level possible by HITS method for WT10g corpus. Although the HITS system with optimum seed set and short host definition resulted in an average precision value eight times that of the best HITS system (0.3144 vs. 0.0399), it is somewhat disappointing as a maximum performance threshold. One could even view this as the failing of HITS algorithm, which reduces the seed system performance by one third at best. The performance of the optimum HITS system in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,377.72,613.46,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_2">3</ref> may not necessarily reflect the true potential of link analysis approach. In addition to potential effects of incomplete relevance judgments and truncated link structure with heavy concentration of spurious links in WT10g collection <ref type="bibr" coords="6,137.12,651.50,117.48,9.94" target="#b9">(Gurrin &amp; Smeaton, 2001)</ref>, we note that 42 out of 50 TREC-10 topics have less than 100 known relevant documents. In fact, 31 of those 42 topics have less than 50 known relevant documents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>bring in more noise during link expansion and thus result in expanded sets with dominant link structures unrelated to the original topics.</p><p>Another point to consider about the HITS method is its tendency to rank documents in relatively small clusters, where each cluster represents mutually reinforcing communities (i.e. hubs and authorities) on sufficiently broad topics. This tendency could rank clusters of nonrelevant documents with dense link structure above sparsely linked relevant documents, which will adversely affect average precision but may not affect high precision.</p></div>

It is interesting to note that the best VSM fusion result (0.1354 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,413.42,213.50,4.61,9.94">4</ref>) is worse than the best VSM single system result (0.1406 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,283.61,226.22,3.96,9.94">3</ref>), while the best HITS fusion result (0.0540 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,90.04,238.82,4.60,9.94">5</ref>) is better than the best HITS single system result (0.0399 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,392.73,238.82,3.96,9.94">3</ref>). One possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that the best VSM system dominates all other systems (i.e. additional relevant documents introduced by other system are negligible), while the best HITS system result is enhance by unique contributions from other HITS systems. In other words, HITS systems may produce more diverse result sets than VMS systems and are thus helped by fusion.</p><p>Combining text-and link-based systems (Table <ref type="table" coords="7,338.49,302.06,4.54,9.94">6</ref>) resulted in performance degradation of text-based results, even when the best HITS and VSM systems were combined (0.1012 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,516.47,314.78,5.52,9.94">6</ref> vs. 0.1406 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,179.77,327.38,3.97,9.94">3</ref>). When the optimum HITS result was combined with the best VSM result (0.3144 and 0.1406 in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,219.42,340.11,3.99,9.94">3</ref>), however, the improvement by fusion was almost linear (0.4549). Although such fusion system is unrealistic, it does suggest the fusion potential where optimum performance level of one method can be raised by combining it with a reasonably effective method of a different kind. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In WT10g topic relevance task, we examined the effect of combining result sets as well as those of various evidence source parameters for text-and link-based methods. Analysis of results suggests that index source, query length, and host definition are the most influential system parameters for retrieval performance. We found link-based systems, HITS in particular, to perform significantly worse than text-bases systems, and combining results sets using the similarity merge formula did not enhance retrieval performance in general. Performance improvement by fusion occurred only on two occasions: once when HITS systems with short host definition were combined, and another time when the optimum HITS result was combined with the best VSM result. The general failure of fusion evidenced in our results could be due to the characteristics of WT10g test collection, failings of link analysis, inadequacies of fusion formula, or combinations of all or any of the above. The optimum fusion combination result suggests to us that fusion potential exists despite possible shortcomings of the test collection and individual retrieval methods. Consequently, we believe the future fusion efforts should focus on discovering the fusion formula that can best realize the fusion potential of combining diverse retrieval methods.</p></div>			</div>
