<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This year a Fujitsu Laboratory team participated in web tracks. Both for ad hoc task, and entry point search task, we combined the score of normal ranking search and that of page ranking techniques. For ad hoc style task, the eect of page ranking was very limitted. We only got very little improvement for title eld search, and the page rank was not eective for description, and narrative eld search.</p><p>For entry point search task, we compared three heuristics. The rst heuristics supposed that entry point page contains key word and had high page rank score. The second heuristics supposed that entry point page contains key word in its head part and had high page ran score. The third heuristics supposes that entry point is pointed by the pages whose anchor string contains key word, and has high page rank score. The page rank improved the result of entry point search about 20-30% in rather small VLC10 test set, and the rst heuristics got the best result because of its high recall.</p><p>document. The score for one document is the sum of the term weights with co-occurence boosting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">System Description</head><p>For TREC2001, we added the new functions to trec exec for entry point search. The functions includes score merging, evaluation of reciprocal rank and so on. We u s e d W eb Recommener Agent to get page ranking score. Except above modications, the framework is same as that of TREC9 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.01,405.53,15.59,13.01" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.0.1">Tera</head><p>Tera <ref type="bibr" coords="1,78.10,449.69,15.02,13.01" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is a fulltext search library, designed to provide an adequate number of ecient functions for commercial service, and to provide parameter combination testing and easy extension for experiments in IR.</p><p>1.0.2 trec exec trec exec is designed for automatic processing of TREC. It contains a procedure controller, evaluation module , logging module, and all non-searching units such as query generation, query expansion and so on. trec exec can execute all the TREC processing for one run in a few minutes, and it can be used for system tuning by hill-climing. The new functions added for TREC2001 Web track are heuristics for entry point search, evaluation of reciprocal rank, and accepting non-digit query number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.0.3">Web Recommender Agent</head><p>We used web recommeder agent tool developed for automatic domain specic web directory Tsuda et al <ref type="bibr" coords="1,65.39,622.01,10.96,13.01" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to get page ranking score. The page rank score is put into Tera, and it is marged with normal ranking score. The indexing vocabulary consists of character strings made up of letters, numbers, and symbols, and no stop words were used in indexing. For TREC8, we modied the grammar of the token recognizer to accept acronyms with symbols such as U.S., and AT&amp;T as one token.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Stop word list for query processing</head><p>As in the TREC8 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.88,268.73,15.59,13.01" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we used a stop word list of about 400 words of Fox <ref type="bibr" coords="2,378.71,268.73,12.46,13.01" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and words with a high df (more than 1/7 of the number of all documents) were also treated as stop words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5">Stop pattern removal</head><p>The expression of TREC queries are articial, so frequently appearing patterns such as \relevant d o c u -ment\ are stop patterns. We generalized this observation, and removed the words which meet one of the following condition.</p><p>1. Word in stopword list is a stopword. 2. Word which is not a proper noun 1 , and whose df in TREC1-7 queries is more than 400*0.1 is a stop word. 3. Word bi-gram whose df in TREC1-7 queries is more than 400*0.02 is a stop pattern. 4. Word tri-gram whose df in TREC1-7 queries is more than 400*0.01 is a stop pattern. 5. All the words in a sentence that contains \not relevant" are stop words. 6. 4 words following \other than" are stop words. 7. 4 words following \apart from" are stop words.</p></div>

The weight for title eld is decreased for TREC2001 because weighting title eld that is weighting raw Web query, does not produce good result. Some teams <ref type="bibr" coords="3,138.04,199.61,9.96,13.01" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,154.68,199.61,10.20,13.01" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,168.28,199.61,10.20,13.01" target="#b7">[8]</ref> used weighting depending on eld type, and we take the same approach.</p><p>tf is the bare frequency in each eld. ttw is the term type weight. It is set to 3 for terms, and set to 1 for phrase(word bi-gram).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">tf</head><p>We simply used the tf part of OKAPI <ref type="bibr" coords="3,240.75,264.41,15.54,13.01" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>tf = (k 1 + 1 ) 3 term fr e q (k 1 ((1 0 b) + b3doc length in byte average doc length in byte ) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,498.72,289.13,12.73,13.01" target="#b2">(3)</ref> where k 1 = 1 :5; b= 0 :75</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">idf</head><p>We used a modied idf of OKAPI. We introduced a cut o point for low df words, and decreased the idf value for high df words. idf = log 2 N 0 (n 3 ) n ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,502.96,380.09,4.24,13.01">4</ref>) where N is the number of documents n is document frequency(df) if df &gt; 1/10000 * N else n is 1=10000 3 N is set to 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Co-occurence Boosting</head><p>As in TREC8, we use co-occurence boosting techinique which favours co-occurence of query terms in a document. Co-ocurrence boosting is implemented by simply multipling the boost ratio to the similarity of each term.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,247.44,498.81,264.01,44.43">S i = X t B 3 W t;i<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where S i is the degree of similarity between a document and topics. i is the document n u m ber. t is a term that document i includes. W t;i is the part of similarity of term t in document i . B is the boost-ratio by term co-occurrence.</p><p>The best parameter B depends on the query, but it is dicult to tune them for each query. A s i n t h e case of eld weighting, the weight for title eld is decreased. We set the B to 1.05 for the title word, to 1.05 for the description word, and to 1.00 for the narrative word, and to 1.0 for the word added by query expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">phrase(bi-gram)</head><p>Instead of traditional IR phrase (two adjacent non-stopword pair with order or without order), we permitted limited distance in phrase. The motivation for introducing xed distance is that that non-stopword may exist between two adjacent words in a query, and it producued slightly better result in the past experiment. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,106.59,106.97,13.23,13.01" target="#b0">[1]</ref> The term weight of bi-gram is xed as 1/3 of a single word, and the distance is set to 4.</p><p>The phrase(bi-gram) is not used for entry point search, as it was too restrictive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Query Expansion</head><p>Query Expansion was used for the ad hoc task, and small web track. The Boughanem formula <ref type="bibr" coords="4,478.61,165.29,13.14,13.01" target="#b5">[6]</ref> was used to select terms.</p><p>T S V= ( r=R0 s=S):w (1)   (6) where w (1) is modied and more general version of Robertson/Sparck Jones weight. The was set 0.001, and k4 was -0.3, k5 was 1, and k6 was 64. The top 20 documents in the pilot search were supposed to be relevant, and the documents ranked from 500 to 1000 were supposed to be non-relevant. The top ranked 40 words which are not included in original query, which are not included in the stopword list of SMART, whose tsv score are more than 0.003, whose df are more than 60, and whose df are less than 200000 were added to the original query.</p><p>No collection enrichment technique was used, and query expansion was used only for ad hoc runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Page Ranking</head><p>Google is famous search engine that uses link based ranking approach <ref type="bibr" coords="4,359.20,335.93,13.29,13.01" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The intutive i d e a o f G o o g l e i s that pages cited frequently are important, and that pages cited from important pages are also important. We adopted a Revised Page Ranking scheme which is proposed in Tsuda et al <ref type="bibr" coords="4,395.54,358.01,10.52,13.01" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The scheme distingues the internal server(local) link, and external server(remote) link. The modication reects the fact that the local link may be self link and less important than the link from external server (linked from others). RankScore is score of ranking for a document PageRank is score of Page rank for a document is RankScore factor which takes between 0 and 1 n is the number of TREC output or the number of document retrieved.</p><p>The RankScore factor is dierent for ad hoc search, and entry point search. For ad hoc search, RankScore facotor is set to 0.95 or 1.0. It is because we got no improvment for ad hoc search except in title eld using PageRank score. For entry point search, RankScore facotor is set to 0.47.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Ad hoc Search</head><p>Except title only runs, the query processing is same as that of traditional ad hoc task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Result</head><p>Four runs were submitted, ie. abxt, abxtl, abxtd, and abxtdn. In the run id, the inx 'l' means link, 't' means using title eld, 'd' means using description eld, and 'n' means using narrative eld. The eect of page ranking is very limited or obscure for ad hoc search. We get very little improvement only for title only eld search for test run, and no improvement for description, narrative eld search at all.</p><p>It seems that web page with high page ranking score is often top of domain, or user, and is informative, but does not necessarly match the information need of ad hoc style query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Entry Point Search</head><p>For all entry point search runs, we used characteristics of Web, that is page rank score, anchor string and document structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Heuristics for entry point search</head><p>For entry search we experimented three dierent heuristics. We describe them here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Simple Page Rank</head><p>The rst heuristics supposes that good entry point contains key words (theme of page) in it and has high page rank. This approach seems to be popular in web search engines such as google, teoma <ref type="bibr" coords="6,416.48,136.49,17.93,13.01" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and wisenut[11], and to produce good result if compared with simple ranking search. The ranking proecedure is that top 1000 pages are ranked by ranking equation1 , and they are rerankked using equation8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Head Part and Page Rank</head><p>The title of Web page often appears to contain key words (theme of page). For example, the entry point page for EP5 query \Haas Business School" contains \Haas School of Business"in head part, and the entry page for EP2 \Hunt Memorial Library\ contains \Hunt Libary" in head part.</p><p>The second heuristics supposes that good entry point contains key words (them of page) in head part of the page, and has high page rank score.</p><p>As the head part of the page, we used top 256 byte of each page. This heuritstics might not get better result than simple page ranking, but was expected to get high precision if head part contains keywords. The ranking procedure is the same as that of simple page ranking heuristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Pointed by Anchor and Page Rank</head><p>Web page name which is in anchor string seems to be most direct and reliable evidence of entry page though anchor string often contains pronoun such as \this", \here". Third heuristics suppose that good entry point is pointed by anchor string of high ranked pages, and has high page rank.</p><p>In our experiment, we use 75 byte string around anchor, instead of using just anchor string. It is because we got little avaliable anchor string set. If WT10G test set contains enough web pages whose out link contains anchor string to the pages within WT10G, and that anchor strings match entry point search query, this heuristics is expected to be best in the three. The searching procedure is as follows.</p><p>(a) Searching anchor string (around anchor string 75byte), and reraking using equation8. (anchoring page) (b) Collecting document ids which is pointed out by anchoring page.(referred page) (c) Scoring the referred page by following equation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,215.28,532.93,296.17,87.28">Ref(t) = ( 1 0 ) 3 gap3 P ageRank(t) + 3 ReferScore(t) ReferScore(t) = n X i=0 Score(i) Score(i) = Rank(max)=Rank(i) 3 S(i)<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where t is a document id in referred page set.</p><p>is Page Rank factor which takes between 0 and 1.</p><p>i is a document id of anchoring page which referts document id t Rank is rank of document id. max is max number of retrieved text of anchoring page search. S(i) is equation8. For ad hoc style search, we did not get improvment by just combing normal ranking score and page ranking score. But it is uncertain whether page ranking score has no eect for ad hoc style search, or WT10G test set is too small for ad hoc search using page ranking. For entry page search, we get about 30% improvement using page ranking score.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,182.64,403.33,120.45,14.33;4,306.24,399.49,59.26,11.77;4,315.36,410.34,40.89,13.31;4,231.36,430.02,48.25,13.31;4,312.00,424.02,20.80,13.31;4,332.88,424.92,3.65,7.31;4,283.44,436.02,58.35,13.31;4,341.76,443.20,9.40,5.33;4,351.60,436.02,13.98,13.31;4,255.36,448.98,111.26,13.31;4,272.40,480.42,7.17,13.31;4,308.88,474.66,26.95,13.31;4,335.76,475.32,3.65,7.31;4,283.44,486.66,82.14,13.31;4,274.56,499.62,92.19,13.31;4,499.68,513.54,11.77,13.31;4,61.44,534.17,25.49,13.01;4,72.72,544.57,7.12,15.13;4,79.92,551.46,14.79,7.86;4,95.04,544.57,175.50,15.13;4,58.08,556.33,7.12,15.13;4,65.28,563.46,10.01,7.86;4,75.60,556.33,165.51,15.13;4,58.08,568.33,43.00,15.13;4,101.04,575.46,14.79,7.86;4,116.16,568.33,34.44,15.13;4,150.48,575.46,10.01,7.86;4,161.04,569.93,15.01,13.01;4,58.08,580.33,170.68,15.13;4,72.72,592.33,325.92,15.13;4,58.08,621.43,207.26,13.45;4,58.08,638.65,453.42,15.13;4,58.08,652.25,453.34,13.01;5,58.08,52.97,453.16,13.01;5,58.08,63.13,241.87,15.13;5,195.84,80.65,157.65,15.13;5,271.44,95.53,81.98,15.13;5,236.16,116.89,25.90,15.13;5,267.12,92.49,10.52,28.78;5,277.68,110.58,4.92,7.86;5,277.68,118.50,12.91,7.86;5,292.80,110.17,58.39,15.13;5,265.92,106.17,10.52,28.78;5,276.48,124.26,4.92,7.86;5,276.48,132.42,12.91,7.86;5,291.60,123.85,60.76,15.13;5,498.72,139.85,12.73,13.01;5,58.08,157.61,25.49,13.01"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>T ) is the number of remote link from T C loc (T) is the number of local link from T C(T) = C rem (T ) + C loc (T ) [0;1] is weighting factor for local link.The d is set to 0.5, and the local link factor is set to 0.1 for ocial runs.2.7 Marging Score and RerankingBoth for entry point search, and ad hoc search of title eld query, top N doucments are retrieved by normal ranking strategy rst, and the documents are resorted by using page ranking score.
