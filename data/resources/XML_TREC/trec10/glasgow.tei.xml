<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this paper we examine the extent to which implicit feedback (where the system attempts to estimate what the user may be interested in) can act as a substitute for explicit feedback (where searchers explicitly mark documents relevant). Therefore, we attempt to side-step the problem of getting users to explicitly mark documents relevant by making predictions on relevance through analysing the user's interaction with the system. Specifically, we hypothesised that implicit and explicit feedback were interchangeable as sources of relevance information for relevance feedback. Through developing a system that utilised each type of feedback we were able to compare the two approaches in terms of search effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Systems</head><p>Our basic experimental system is a generic interface that can connect to any web search engine. In our experiments we use the interface to connect to the Google search engine. The interface is based on a summarisation interface developed for investigating web search behaviour, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,181.18,494.11,43.05,13.28" target="#b0">[WJR01,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,229.03,494.11,36.92,13.28" target="#b1">WRJ01]</ref>. The system we developed for the experiments in this paper also incorporates a component that displays sentences from the retrieved set of web pages. These sentences are ones that have a high degree of match with the user's query. The set of sentences and the ranking of the sentences automatically updates in the presence of relevance information from the user (relevance feedback). That is the content of the summary is used to form a new query which is used to create a new list of important sentences for display to the user. Two interfaces were developed; one which uses explicit feedback and one which uses implicit feedback. The explicit feedback interface had checkboxes to allow users to explicitly mark documents relevant; the implicit interface assumed that any document for which a summary was requested was of interest to the user. Our experimental hypothesis was the degree to which the implicit interaction could substitute for the explicit relevance assessments. Details of the systems can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.10,673.49,41.18,13.28" target="#b2">[WRJ02]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental details</head><p>In total, 16 subjects participated in our experiments. All subjects were educated to graduate level in a non-computing, non-LIS discipline, with three exceptions, all our subjects were recruited from the Information Technology course at the University of Glasgow. All users, with one exception, used the Internet on a regular basis.</p><p>The average age of the subjects was 24.75 with a range of 11 years. Most users used computers and the Internet frequently -the average time spent online per week was 14 hours. With three exceptions, all users cited Google as amongst their favourite search engines.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,124.30,241.65,6.00,13.28">1</ref> shows the tasks we used in the experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results &amp; Analysis</head><p>Most of the data used to assess search effectiveness came from the logs generated by the system during the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Number of Results Pages Viewed</head><p>The total number of result pages viewed and queries submitted during all the experiments was recorded. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,192.96,205.53,6.00,13.28" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the average results per user obtained. These differences are not significant using a Mann-Whitney Test at p â‰¤ 0.05 (p = 0.234).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variation</head><p>Our system gave access to the first 30 documents retrieved by the underlying search engine, and in many cases this was sufficient to complete the tasks. This meant that there was no real need for users to browse to the next 30 results (i.e. results 30 to 60 in standard search engines). The lack of a significant difference between the 'implicit' and 'explicit' systems shows that the type of system used does not affect the number of result pages viewed or query iterations needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Task Completion</head><p>As part of the post-task questionnaire users were asked whether they felt they had successfully completed the task just attempted, it is these results that are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,122.09,534.90,4.49,13.28" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The choice of whether a task was complete was left up to the user. It was thought that this best reflected real-world retrieval situations. However, the experimenter was occasionally asked to verify the correctness of the results obtained. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,482.18,562.50,6.00,13.28" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows these results (out of 64).</p><p>Again these results are not significant using a Mann-Whitney Test at p â‰¤ 0.05 (p = 0.361). There is no significant difference between the number of tasks that users completed on the 'implicit' and the 'explicit' systems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Task Times</head><p>The time taken to complete tasks on both systems was measured. When a task was incomplete, a figure of 600 seconds (10 minutes) would be recorded by the system. This was the time limit imposed on each task and users were not allowed to work past this. In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,120.30,261.93,6.00,13.28" target="#tab_3">3</ref> we can see these results.  From an analysis of the log files we were able to establish that no significant difference existed between the two variations. This appears to add a little weight to our claim that perhaps the 'implicit' and 'explicit' feedback are at least to some degree substitutable, although factors such as the similarity of the interface design may be important too. If the results obtained were significant we could suggest that one type of system promotes search effectiveness more than the other. In this case, there is no significant difference, and it is safe to assume that some degree of substitutability does indeed exist.</p></div>
