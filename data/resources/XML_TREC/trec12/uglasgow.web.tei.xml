<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Our participation in both tasks of the Web track is a continuation of our TREC11 evaluation of a modular probabilistic framework for Web Information Retrieval, which integrates content and link analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.76,395.18,9.62,10.80" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This year, we introduce a new notion called query scope, which is employed in order to decide dynamically about the most appropriate combination of content and hyperlink analyses. Our assumption is that a query-based application of link analysis performs better than a uniform approach, where the same method is applied indifferently for all queries.</p><p>The estimation of the query scope is based on statistical evidence obtained from the set of retrieved documents. The query scope is used as an input into a simple decision mechanism, with which we select the most appropriate retrieval approach for each query. The approaches we employ are content-only retrieval, retrieval based on the content of documents and the anchor text of their incoming links, and a combination of the last approach with a score obtained from the URL length of a document, or from the Static Utility Absorbing Model, a hyperlink analysis model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,198.31,504.86,9.53,10.80" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>This year, we find that the combination of content and anchor text retrieval is highly effective, increasing the precision over content-only retrieval. This contrasts with our findings from last year's TREC11 topic distillation task, where the content-only retrieval outperformed any other approach for the topic distillation task. In addition, we find that using a URL length-based score for the most generic queries increases precision for the same task.</p><p>The known item task for this year is a mixture of named and home page queries. The query scope is used to detect the probable type of each query, and apply an appropriate retrieval approach. For example, we assume that home page queries could benefit from the combination of content and anchor text with the URL length score. We find that content and anchor text is still a very effective retrieval approach for this task.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, the query scope is defined. Sections 3 and 4 contain a description of our official runs and a set of additional runs for the topic distillation task. In Section 5, we present our experiments for the known item task, while Section 6 contains our conclusions from this year's participation in the Web track.</p><p>Assuming that not all queries benefit from the same retrieval approach, we need to find which of the available approaches is most appropriate for a specific query. Hence, we introduce a decision mechanism that will associate to each query the most appropriate approach. For example, for specific queries we employ a content-only retrieval, while for more generic queries, we use evidence from the hyperlinks, or the URLs. The decision mechanism is based on a composite measure, the query scope, which addresses three important statistical aspects of the set of retrieved documents.</p><p>The first aspect addressed is related to the number of retrieved documents. We assume that for the more generic queries, there will be many documents that contain all the query terms. In these cases, the queries address a topic that is widely covered in the collection. Therefore, evidence from hyperlink analysis may be more useful in detecting high quality documents, or homepages of relevant sites.</p><p>The ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¤© is the number of retrieved documents that contain all the query terms, normalised between 0 and 1 by dividing with a given fraction of the total number of documents in the test collection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,124.90,189.50,75.10,8.80">¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© "! $#</formula><p>% '&amp; number of retrieved documents containing all query terms( ) 10 12</p><p>The normalisation is introduced as most of the queries tend to retrieve only a small fraction of documents from the collection, and therefore dividing by leads to a better distributed measure. In our experiments, we normalised the query extent by dividing with 0 ¦3 of the number of documents in the collection. The second aspect is about finding whether there are sites devoted to the query's topic. If there are such sites, we expect that they will contain a high number of documents with all the query terms, and that their homepages will be more useful than other documents. Similarly to the approaches used in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,389.23,270.74,9.71,10.80" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.58,270.74,6.55,10.80" target="#b7">8]</ref>, we assume that a site is defined by the domain of the document's URL, and we group the documents according to their domain.</p><p>We denote by 4 15 76 £ 98 the number of documents from the @ th site. In addition, let A CB D FE HG and I ¤B D PE 9G be the average and the standard deviation respectively of 4 15 76 £ 8 for @ RQ S 0 ) ¤T , where is the number of the retrieved sites. We define the ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¦ W© as the number of sites for which the size is higher than A B D PE HG YX acb I B D PE 9G :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,124.90,328.50,375.73,16.28">¥ £ 4 ¡ dV F© £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© &amp; number of sites for which 4 15 e6 £ 98 gf A hB D FE HG X ipb I ¤B qD FE HG (<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The third aspect is related to the distribution of root, subroot and path documents among the top ranks. Kraaij et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,119.38,364.34,10.43,10.80" target="#b3">[4]</ref> have classified the documents into four types according to the type of their URL: r root documents (e.g. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) r subroot documents (e.g. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ir/) r path documents (e.g. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ir/projects/) r file documents (e.g. http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/ir/people.html)</p><p>We expect that for the home page finding queries, there will be a higher number of documents of the first three types distributed in the top ranks, than for named page finding or topic distillation queries. For this reason, we employ the sum of the reciprocal ranks of documents from the first three categories as an indication of the user's intent to retrieve a home page, so that both the ranks and the number of these documents are taken into account.</p><p>In order to obtain the sum of reciprocal ranks, we rank the documents according to their content, and we denote the 5 th document by s D . Then, if s D is either a root, a subroot, or a path, we set RRt u5 ev to the reciprocal rank of s D , otherwise we set it equal to zero:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,124.68,523.94,375.95,21.72">RRt u5 ev xw y D if s D is a root, subroot, or path document otherwise<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The sum of the reciprocal ranks is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,124.90,579.20,375.72,28.30">¥ ¢ h 4 ¡ D y RRt u5 ev<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In all our experiments we used " 0 U .</p><p>Having defined the three components of query scope in Equations ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,367.71,619.58,3.18,10.80" target="#formula_1">1</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,384.55,619.58,3.48,10.80" target="#formula_2">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,415.01,619.58,3.48,10.80" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) respectively, we can proceed with defining a decision mechanism that will employ these measures. Depending on the Web track task, we use the most appropriate of the components defined above, in order to decide how to combine the content and the hyperlink analysis. For the topic distillation task, we employ the ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© and the ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¤© , while for the known item finding task, we use the ¡ d£ ¥ ¢ § £ © £ ¦ ¤© and the ¥ ¢ 4 ¡ d .</p><p>More specifically, for the topic distillation task, the decision mechanism is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,433.97,48.50,3.36,10.80">1</ref>. The queries that have high ¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¦ W© and ¥ £ 4 ¡ dV F© £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© (case I), are treated as more generic. On the contrary, the queries, which result in low values for the query scope components (case IV), are considered to be specific. For the rest of the queries (cases II and III), we cannot say with confidence whether they are generic or specific queries. Both thresholds © G and © G are determined experimentally.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,163.40,111.90,273.50,35.84">¥ £ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¤© Y i© G ¥ £ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© a© G ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© a© G case I (generic queries) case III (unknown) ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© a© G case II (unknown) case IV (specific queries)</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,209.74,157.70,3.48,10.80">1</ref>: The decision mechanism for the topic distillation task</p><p>For the known item finding task, our aim is to distinguish between the named page finding queries and the home page finding queries.

Therefore, in the decision mechanism for the known item finding task, we employ the ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¤© and the ¥ ¢ 4 ¡ d , as shown in </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Topic Distillation Task</head><p>Our aim is to investigate the appropriateness of the query scope and the corresponding decision mechanism described in Section 2. We test four different retrieval approaches: content-only, content and anchor text, content and anchor text with URL length, content and anchor text with the Static Utility Absorbing Model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.63,386.66,9.53,10.80" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In all runs, we removed stop words and applied stemming during indexing. For the content analysis, we used the weighting model f hg `from Amati and van Rijsbergen's Divergence From Randomness (DFR) framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,120.58,419.54,9.53,10.80" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with i 0 j k . As opposed to last year, the estimation of the c value is done using a new parametertuning methodology for term frequency normalisation, which is collection-independent <ref type="bibr" coords="3,414.17,430.46,9.53,10.80" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The first run, uogtd1c, is a content-only baseline, where only the content of the documents is used. For the second run, uogtd2ca, we test the usefulness of combining the content of documents with the anchor text of their incoming links. Comparing the results of the first two runs, we can see that there is a significant improvement from using anchor text, for both precision at 10 and R precision (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,368.34,474.26,3.24,10.80" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>With the third run, we introduce a simplified version of the decision mechanism, as defined for the topic distillation task in Section 2. For the queries where ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ © £ ¦ ¤© a© l G , we use the content of documents only. For the rest of the queries, where ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ © £ ¦ ¤© m n© l G , we employ the content and anchor text of documents. Therefore, in this configuration, we only use ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ © £ ¦ ¤© , for which the threshold is experimentally set to © G po (Table <ref type="table" coords="4,157.54,37.58,3.24,10.80" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,204.06,37.58,3.36,10.80">5</ref>, we show the number of queries for which each retrieval approach was applied, along with the number of queries for which the applied approach was at least as effective as the alternative retrieval approach.</p></div>

However, it is not clear whether this is due to a failure of the decision mechanism, or due to the poor effectiveness of the content-only retrieval.</p><p>In the fourth run, uogtd4cahs, we employ a more fine-grained classification by using both ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© and ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ © £ ¦ ¤© . For the most generic queries (case I), we use both content and anchor text, and we re-rank the top 1000 documents by taking into account their URL length, in order to boost the homepages. Let 4 1i D be the content analysis score of the 5 th document. In addition, let ¡ d¥ UV r d s© t V u£ ¦ D be the length in characters of the 5 th document's URL path <ref type="foot" coords="4,178.92,309.62,2.99,7.20" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .

Table <ref type="table" coords="4,256.71,366.26,4.44,10.80">7</ref> contains the number of queries for which each retrieval approach was applied, along with the number of queries for which the applied approach was at least as effective as the others.  <ref type="table" coords="4,163.18,543.86,3.48,10.80">7</ref>: The number of queries for which each approach was applied in run uogtd4cahs, and the number of queries for which the applied approach was at least as effective as the others.</p></div>

Moreover, looking in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,239.67,584.90,3.36,10.80">7</ref>, we find that both combinations of content with anchor text, and content with anchor text and URL length are very effective for the queries on which they were applied respectively. On the other hand, content-only retrieval is not very appropriate for the selected queries.</p><p>For our last official run of the topic distillation task, uogtd5cass, we combine the content and anchor text of documents with the Static Utility Absorbing Model (SUAM) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,321.84,628.82,9.53,10.80" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a hyperlink analysis approach. Let 4 ¦i D be the content analysis score and 4 1i 1z { D be the Absorbing Model score for the 5 th document.

The Static Utility Absorbing Model scores documents according to both their incoming and outgoing links, aiming to boost the key entry points for a given topic. The decision mechanism employed is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,156.57,92.90,3.36,10.80" target="#tab_5">8</ref>, where the thresholds © G and © G are set to o and j y respectively. In all cases, we employ the content and anchor text of documents, while SUAM is only used for the most generic queries.</p><p>When comparing this run to uogtd2ca, where content and anchor text is used for all the cases, we note that precision at 10 increases slightly (Table <ref type="table" coords="5,241.82,125.78,3.24,10.80" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), due to improvement in 2 out of the 15 most generic queries, for which SUAM is applied (Table <ref type="table" coords="5,189.42,136.70,3.24,10.80" target="#tab_5">8</ref>). For the rest of the queries, effectiveness remains stable. If we consider R precision, we find that SUAM results in improvements for 2 queries, but is also detrimental for 3 queries on which it is applied. </p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="5,151.30,176.90,293.60,30.30">¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¤© Y o ¥ £ 4 ¡ ¤V P© £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© o ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© j y content,</formula></div>

To facilitate the analysis, employing the three retrieval approaches used in uogtd4cahs (Table <ref type="table" coords="5,385.00,312.86,3.24,10.80">7</ref>), we use the two most effective ones, in terms of average precision at 10 over all queries. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,374.21,323.90,3.36,10.80" target="#tab_6">9</ref>, these are content and anchor text retrieval, and content with anchor text and the URL length-based score (Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,396.17,334.82,3.14,10.80" target="#formula_7">5</ref>)).</p><p>Employing the decision mechanism as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,310.09,345.74,3.36,10.80">1</ref>, we use Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,384.20,345.74,3.48,10.80" target="#formula_7">5</ref>) for the cases I and II and only the content and anchor text for the cases III and IV.

From the additional results, we can see that by employing ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¦ W© , we achieve higher precision at 10 for two out of the four threshold values tested. More specifically, for © G 0 , we obtain 0.1480 precision at 10. When we use ¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¦ W© , precision at 10 is between the average precision at 10 of the two most effective retrieval approaches employed. Now, if we consider R precision, both ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¦ W© and ¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¦ W© lead to improvements over the best performing retrieval approach. In addition, ¡ d£ ¥ ¢ § £ © £ ¦ ¤© is more effective than ¥ U£ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ © £ ¦ ¤© , for the tested threshold values. When © G is equal to j y or j y , we obtain j P0 1 y o R precision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Known Item Finding Task</head><p>For the known item finding task, we employ the query scope in order to discriminate between home page and named page queries. We assume that the most effective method for named page queries is to employ content and anchor text retrieval. For home page queries, we use content and anchor text retrieval, and re-rank all the retrieved documents by applying the formula from Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,317.39,79.70,9.53,10.80" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In the first run, uogki1c, we use only the content-only retrieval. The used weighting model is f hg `, as in the case of topic distillation, but with i 0 this time. As expected from last year's named page finding task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,474.51,219.62,9.62,10.80" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the content-based approach is not the most efficient approach (see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,345.30,230.66,7.07,10.80" target="#tab_7">10</ref>). In the second run, uogki2ca, where the document's content and the anchor text of the incoming links are used, the effectiveness increases significantly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Official run</head><p>For the third run, uogki3cah, we also employ the URL length, in the same way as in Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="6,459.82,252.50,3.18,10.80" target="#formula_7">5</ref>), in order to boost the home pages, which tend to have shorter URLs. Although this approach is not appropriate for all queries, it is expected to be effective at least for the home page finding queries.</p><p>Before proceeding with the fourth run, we will look at the effectiveness of content and anchor text retrieval, and content with anchor text and URL length, across the sets of named page and home page finding queries. For the named page queries, content and anchor text retrieval results in 0.613 average reciprocal rank, and for the home page queries the average reciprocal rank is 0.617. On the other hand, content with anchor text and URL length is not so stable across the two sets of queries. For the named page queries, the average reciprocal rank is 0.060, while for the home page finding task it is 0.487. These results show that content and anchor text retrieval is a very robust approach for the known item finding task, and indicate that there is no significant gain in trying to combine different methods.</p><p>However, if we manually select the best approach for each query, then we get 0.680 average reciprocal rank across the two sets of queries. For the named page finding queries, we would get 0.613 and for the home page finding queries we would get 0.747. These figures show that there is room for improvement if a successful combination is found.</p><p>Our last official run intends to simulate automatically the above manual selection. Therefore, we employ the query scope as defined in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,229.35,427.82,4.44,10.80" target="#tab_0">2</ref> for the known item task. We use two components of the query scope, the ¡ d£ ¥ ¢ § £ © £ ¦ ¤© and the ¥ ¢ h 4 ¡ , with threshold values set experimentally to © l B 0 and © G j k as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,132.70,449.78,7.44,10.80" target="#tab_8">11</ref>. For all queries, the content and the anchor text of the incoming links is used, and for the most generic ones, where © B 0 and © G j k , the URL's length is used as defined in Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,438.62,460.70,9.53,10.80" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,121.66,471.74,7.44,10.80" target="#tab_7">10</ref>, precision is close to that of run uogki2ca, where content and anchor text is used.</p><p>We find that the average reciprocal rank of named page queries is 0.554, while for the home page queries it is 0.636. More specifically, the URL length is employed for 56 queries, of which 19 were named page queries and 37 were home page queries. For those 19 named page queries where the URL length is employed, there is no additional improvement. However, for 11 out of the 37 home page queries where the URL length is used, there is an improvement over using only the anchor text. These results show that our decision mechanism succeeds in increasing the effectiveness for the home page queries, but on the other hand, it does not benefit named page queries. More work is needed in order to refine the decision mechanism and improve its effectiveness, compared to that of the manual selection of the most appropriate approaches per query.  We introduce a dynamic approach for combining content and hyperlink analysis, based on the query scope, a composite measure for quantifying three aspects of how appropriate a query is for hyperlink analysis.</p><p>For the topic distillation, we find that employing the anchor text of incoming links outperforms significantly a content-only retrieval. This result contrasts with our findings from TREC11, where the content-only retrieval was the most effective approach for topic distillation. In addition, URL information is very effective in identifying the relevant homepages. As for the dynamic combination of different retrieval approaches, it appears that the decision mechanism is a very effective method, leading to significant improvements in our official results. Moreover, when the most effective individual approaches are employed, we find that the ¥ £ 4 ¡ ¤V F© £ ¦© £ ¤© is more effective with respect to precision at 10, while ¢¡ ¤£ ¦¥ § £ ¦© £ ¦ ¤© achieves better results when R precision is used for the evaluation.</p><p>For the known item finding task, the content and anchor text retrieval is a robust approach, independently of the query type. However, the URL information is useful for the home page queries, and if it is applied appropriately, it results into significant improvement. Our decision mechanism performed nearly as well as the content and anchor text baseline. It resulted in increased effectiveness among the home page queries, while it didn't benefit the named page queries.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that by employing simple statistical mechanisms, it is possible to improve the retrieval effectiveness by combining dynamically evidence from content and hyperlink analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,244.40,579.00,21.94,8.80;6,267.80,583.00,5.60,8.80;6,271.90,579.00,16.40,8.80;6,298.10,589.10,11.10,8.80;6,387.20,579.00,11.10,8.80;6,410.60,583.00,5.60,8.80;6,414.70,579.00,16.40,8.80;6,440.90,589.10,11.10,8.80;6,119.20,590.40,55.60,8.80;6,189.20,600.50,6.30,8.80;6,191.30,592.70,289.73,10.80;6,119.20,601.80,55.60,8.80;6,189.20,611.90,6.30,8.80;6,191.30,604.10,147.02,10.80;6,373.84,604.10,83.82,10.80"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>¢ § £ ¦© £ ¦ W© Y j k content, anchor text and URL length content, anchor text and URL length ¡ ¤£ ¦¥ ¢ § £ ¦© £ ¦ W© Y j k content, anchor text and URL length content and anchor text</figDesc></figure>
