<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">-Mercure model</head><p>Mercure is an information retrieval system based on a connexionist approach and modeled by a multi-layer network. The network is composed of a query layer (set of query terms), of a term layer (representing the indexing terms) and of a document layer [Bougha 99]. Mercure includes the implementation of retrieval process based on spreading activation forward and backward through the weighted links. Queries and documents can be used either as inputs or outputs. The links between layers are symmetric and their weights are based on the tf-idf measure inspired by OKAPI [Robertson 00] and SMART term weighting.</p><p>The query-term links are weighted as follows :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="1,215.94,566.88,163.24,52.97">     &gt; - = otherwise ) (nq if * u ui ui ui u ui u ui qtf qtf qtf nq qtf nq q</formula><p>Where: -q ui : the weight of the term t i in the query u -qtf ui : the query term frequency of t i in the query u -nq u : the number of terms in the query u</p><p>The term-document link weights are expressed by :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="1,232.98,707.75,128.11,62.31">ij l j i ij ij tf h dl h h n N h h tf d * * )) log( * ( * 5 4 3 2 1 + ∆ + + =</formula><p>Where: -d ij : term-document weight of term t i and document d j -tf ij : term frequency of t i in the document d j -N: total number of documents -n i : number of documents containing term t i -h 1 ,h 2 ,h 3 ,h 4 and h 5 : constant parameters -∆ l : average document length</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Query evaluation</head><p>The query evaluation is based on spreading evaluation. Each node computes an input and spreads an output signal. A query is evaluated as follows:</p><p>1 -The query u is the input of the network.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Term proximity</head><p>The ranking function (activation) was modified to take into account term proximity in a document [Kean 91]. Thus, documents having query terms close to each others compute a new input value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,202.80,511.18,187.71,34.18">∑ ∑ - = i i i i ij i j prox d t Out d In 1 , * ) * ) ( ( ) (<label>α</label></formula><p>Where:</p><p>α is a constant parameter such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="2,282.42,559.24,51.18,26.91">1 prox 1 i , i ≥ - α</formula><p>. α is set to 4 for the TREC'2003 experiments.</p><p>-prox i,i-1 is the number of terms separating the query terms t i and t i-1 in a window of α terms in the document. The query terms are ranked according to their position in the query text. In other words, documents having close query terms (i.e. no more than α words separate query term t i and query term t i-1 in the document content) increase their input value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">-Topic distillation task Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Indexing methodology</head><p>The GOV collection was indexed with scripts allowing to take into account term positions in the documents. Terms are stemmed with Porter algorithm and a stop-word list is used in order to remove non-significant terms from the index.</p><p>The queries used for the runs were built from the title and the description fields of the topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Web methodology</head><p>4 runs were performed and submitted to NIST. All runs are ad-hoc retrieval, and have been performed with no relevance feedback and no query expansion. The first two runs are based on a simple search without term proximity. The queries are built using the title field only for the run named Merc1ti, and the title and description for the second run named Merc1td. The last two runs, named Merc2tp and Merc2tm, use term proximity, and only the title field of topics was taking into account. Merc2tm was performed as follows: if the title field of a topic contains phrases (about 25% of the total number of queries), term proximity is chosen to perform the query, otherwise, simple search without term proximity is used. This choice was made manually. Our best performing run for precision at 10 documents is Merc2tm, performed using simple search and term proximity, depending on the presence of phrases in the query. The Rprecision for runs Merc2tm and Merc1ti is comparable. The use of term proximity does not affect the results in a significant way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Analysis</head><p>Using title field only is more suitable than using both title and description fields (run Merc1td), as observed last year. However, it can be noticed that the results we obtained this year are much worse than those obtained in TREC'2002 for the topic distillation task. Indeed, in TREC'2002 our run Mercah, which was an ad-hoc run performed with the Mercure system, was ranked 6 th for the precision at 10 documents. The algorithm used for the run Mercah is the same as the one used for the run Merc1ti performed this year. Nevertheless, the analysis of precisions should not be the only criterion of judgement. In <ref type="bibr" coords="4,84.47,585.11,79.64,10.46">TREC'2002 and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,167.73,585.11,71.31,10.46">TREC'2003, 6</ref> topics obtain the best results and almost the same number of topics obtain the worst results (5 in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,255.67,598.91,79.05,10.46">TREC'2002 and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,337.73,598.91,81.09,10.46">6 in TREC'2003)</ref>. On the other hand, the distribution between "median" and "&gt;median" is different. Indeed, in TREC'2002 more topics were above the median (20) compared to this year (6). In TREC' 2003, much more topics are exactly on the median.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Discussion</head><p>The first explanation we could give to argue such results comes from this year definition of relevant judgements.  <ref type="bibr" coords="5,443.62,145.07,80.85,10.46">TREC'2002 and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,70.86,158.87,60.30,10.46">TREC'2003.</ref> In TREC'2003, the average number of documents per topic is 10.32 and has strongly fell down. For topics with less than 10 documents relevant, the maximum possible scores is less than 1.0. So, it is almost impossible to obtain highest precision this year and it explains our results in term of precision in 2003. So precision at 10 documents is not an appropriate measure. Let us consider another measure, the R-precision, which has became the main measure in TREC'2003. If we analyze each topic's scores for the best run performed with the original Mercure (Merc1ti), we note that for 20% of the topics, the R-precision is relatively high (i.e. higher than 0.2), but for about 60% of the topics, the R-precision is 0. In this last case, most of the topics were those for which the number of relevant documents is smaller than 5. In fact, if there are for example 2 relevant documents, and if they are retrieved at position 3 and 4 by the retrieval system, the R-Precision is 0, even if the relevant documents are in the top 5.</p><p>The second explanation of our results could come from the TREC'2003 topic distillation task definition. Indeed, in [Craswell 02], authors maintain that" for a few topics, the number of such resources is very much higher than expected. While hand-listed pages in Web directories tended to have short URL' S and high indegree, key resources from this year's track did not show such tendencies as strongly "and in conclusion" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,286.62,434.87,16.52,10.46">[…]</ref> the topic distillation task proved difficult to explain to both participants and assessors and there was considerable disparity between the interpretations of these two groups... the task is worth repeating in 2003 but more explanatory effort is needed". In TREC' 2002, ad hoc runs could obtain good results on the topic distillation task because the assessors judged more resources relevant than needed and these resources were not always home Page of site or short URL. In TREC'2003, the topic distillation task was better specified [Trec Guidelines 03]: "We are concentrating solely on websites as resources. The task is to find as many different websites (represented by to their entry pages) as possible within the first ten results. ". Thus, considering this definition of the task, ad-hoc runs are no more suitable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5-Conclusion</head><p>The goal of our participation was to test a ranking function based on term proximity on the Mercure model and to validate the results we obtained in TREC'2002 with ad-hoc strategies on the topic distillation task. The use of term proximity does not improve the results in a significant way. Moreover, for the 4 ad-hoc runs we submitted this year, performances are not as high as last year. In fact in TREC'2003, the topic distillation task has evolved. Indeed, the spirit of the topic distillation task is to take a large set of relevant results and distill it down to a few key home pages. An overview of the TREC 2003 web track for all participants lets appear that referring anchor text was important and that URL information and link structure was very useful in several cases. Thus, the top 5 groups at R-precision have used at least document structure, anchor text or link structure. Ad hoc runs show their performances regressed for this topic distillation task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,70.86,472.25,449.90,216.93"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Table1describes the results obtained at TREC'2003 Topic Distillation Task for official runs.
