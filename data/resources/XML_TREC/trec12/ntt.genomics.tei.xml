<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Genomics Track Primary Task</head><p>Our system consists of two steps. The first step retrieves documents using a keyword search, and the second step scores each document retrieved in the previous step and creates an output file for the TREC submission.</p><p>The database provided by TREC consists of more than 500,000 PubMed abstracts. However, less than 50 documents are relevant for most queries. Applying scoring methods to all 500,000 abstracts would create a lot of noise. In the first step, we refined the document set with a simple keyword search.</p><p>For the second step, we developed two methods. The first method (Method 1) uses a heuristic scoring system that simply counts the number of verbs and their derived words, which are important to specify the function of a query gene or its product. The second method (Method 2) uses a machine learning technique to score documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Document Retrieval using Keyword Search</head><p>TREC provides categories for each query. Namely, official/alias gene/product names, symbols and species. Although species are not necessarily described on documents, "names" or "symbols" should be written in rele-vant documents. We retrieved all documents that include at least one "name" or "symbol" for each query. They are scored in the next step.</p><p>Symbols are represented in various ways in various documents. For example:</p><p>• An alias symbol between parentheses follows an official name, such as "p21(Cip)".</p><p>• Some symbols are connected by slashes, such as "p21/Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1".</p><p>• A combination of the above two cases, such as "p21(WAF/CIP1)".</p><p>Additionally, symbols could be written by uppercase characters, lowercase characters or a mixture of both. In this step, we searched for symbols between spaces or marks, such as '-', '/', '(' or ')', without distinction between uppercase and lowercase characters.</p><p>8,538 documents for TREC training queries and 18,084 documents for TREC test queries were retrieved in this step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.2">Method 1 : Heuristic Scoring System</head><p>In the previous step, documents that could be relevant to each query gene were obtained. The problem is whether the documents refer to the function of the query gene or a product of it. In this step, all of the retrieved documents are scored for this purpose.</p><p>¿From the analysis of all relevant documents for the TREC training data, we found that common verbs or their derived words, such as "express", "bind" or "inhibition", are often used to describe functions of genes. These words are located adjacent to keywords (query names or symbols). We manually extracted 97 kinds of verbs or their derived words from the vicinity of keywords. We, then, generated a list of words that includes their inflected forms and derived words. Here, we call these words "function words". The list of function words consists of 595 words. The following are parts of this list. To score each document retrieved in the previous step, a set of words is made using five words before and after the keywords. Then, the score is simply calculated by counting the number of "function words" in the list, allowing for duplication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.3">Method 2 : Scoring System using SVM</head><p>In Method 1, important information for scoring might be lost because of its simplicity and heuristics. We adopted a machine learning techniques to automatically reflect such information to the scoring system.</p><p>Machine learning methods such as the Perceptron or Support Vector Machine (SVM) generate discriminant functions whose inputs are mainly vectors and whose outputs are real values. While these methods are usually used as classifiers that output the sign of the discriminant functions, many applications adopt the real value outputs of discriminant functions as confident scores. In this task, we use this value and the SVM as a machine learning method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making Vectors from Documents</head><p>Representing each document by vector is necessary to make inputs of an SVM<ref type="foot" coords="2,172.00,618.06,3.49,6.27" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . We used the classical "bag of words" model for vectors.</p><p>To make vectors, all five words before and after keyword query gene names or symbols are extracted, as well as Method 1. All words except stopwords are used as features of vectors. To decide the values for these vectors, we tried some weighting methods such as TFIDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) and TF in addition to simple binary vectors. However, these weighting methods did not improve the performance. We therefore used binary vectors for all experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature Selection</head><p>All features of high dimensional vectors are not always effective for discriminant functions. Some features appear in very few documents or have no information for discrimination. The features satisfying the following conditions are eliminated.</p><p>• The document frequency is less than Θ min .</p><p>• The ratio of positive (relevant) documents to negative (irrelevant) documents is less than Θ ratio .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Experiment for TREC Training Set</head><p>The 8,538 retrieved documents included 233 relevant documents that are 78.5 % of 297 documents provided by TREC<ref type="foot" coords="2,336.07,444.36,3.49,6.27" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . We evaluated Methods 1 and 2 using this data. We divided the data into two sets to create the training and test data for Method 2. The first set is made from queries 1 to 25 and the second is made from the rest. We call the former "Set1" and the latter "Set2". Documents corresponding to queries 21, 35 and 49 were eliminated because they do not include any relevant documents. Set1 consists of 4,675 documents, Set2 consists of 3,560 documents. Set1 and Set2 are used for training and testing, respectively, in Method 2. For Method 2, 12,494 features were extracted from the 4,675 training data.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,344.51,589.87,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the results of Method 1. The method was applied to Set1, Set2 and the whole TREC training set independently, because Method 1 does not need training. The evaluation was performed by mean average precision (MAP) using the "trec eval"program. In Method 2, two kernels, the first and second order polynomial kernels, were applied and various kinds of parameters were examined, namely, Θ min and Θ ratio for feature selection and the SVM soft margin parameter (C). The best parameters, Θ min = 2, Θ ratio = 4 and C = 0.01, were decided by comparing the mean average precision of Set2.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,106.96,427.26,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results of Method 2. The result for the whole TREC training set was calculated using the TREC training set for SVM training. Set1 and the whole TREC training set have a much higher mean average precision since they are also used for training. Therefore, only the result of Set2 may be an estimation of the TREC test. Methods 1 and 2 yield almost even performances, even though Method 1 utilizes only 595 words in contrast with more than 10,000 words by Method 2. This indicates that verbs and their derived words are crucially important to specify documents that describe the functions of genes or their products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Results for Test Set and Discussion</head><p>In the first step, 18,084 documents were extracted from the test queries provided by TREC. We applied both Methods 1 and 2 to this data and made two files for submission. Dummy PubMed IDs were filled for queries 7 and 26 because no documents were retrieved in the first step. TREC returned average precision scores for each query. The scores of the best, median and worst system were also provided for each query. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,435.24,278.18,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the mean average precisions of Method 1 and Method 2 compared with the best and median systems submitted to TREC. The results for Method 1 and Method 2 are almost even, which is consistent with the evaluation for the training set (Subsection 1.2). However, both methods have a little worse than mean average precision.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,350.43,382.48,4.98,8.97" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the distribution of the average precisions of Method 1 and Method 2 compared to the best and median systems submitted to TREC. The horizontal axis denotes the average precision and the vertical axis denotes the number of queries. The best scores are significantly high because they do not necessarily come from only one system. The score of the median systems could be a good indicator for average systems. Although the form of distributions are similar among Method 1, Method 2 and the median systems, Methods 1 and 2 have too many low scores less than 0.2. Actually, Method 1 has nine queries whose average precisions are zero and Method 2 has seven queries, of which eight queries are the same for both methods. This comes from the fact that very few documents were retrieved in the first step. For seven zero score queries, only less than ten documents were retrieved in the first step. Extending queries for the first step considering variations of the description of the gene names, or integrated scoring systems that consider whether a given document describes a query gene and its function simultaneously, will be necessary to improve the performance of our system. We extracted the sequence patterns of the characteristic words (more correctly, the characteristic stems) in the sentences described the gene functions in the training data, in order to generate automatically the phrase that describes the function of a gene. Next, we scored the test sentences using the information criteria of the sequence patterns.</p><p>Last, we output the sentence with the highest score as the phrase explaining the gene's function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Labeling Positive and Negative Labels to Training Set</head><p>First, as preparation for calculating the information criteria, we gave positive or negative labels to the training sentences according to whether their sentences are close to a correct answer or not. After we divided articles into sentences by our sentence boundary detector, we selected sentences with a small Edit Distance to the actual GeneRIF used as correct answers out of the training set. We gave these positive labels and gave the others negative labels.</p><p>More precisely, we labeled sentences whose Edit Distances were 30 % or less than the length of the GeneRIF and the sentence with the smallest Edit Distance as posi-tive. We labeled the other sentences as negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Specification of Gene Name</head><p>The information about whether a sentence includes gene names is important for judging whether the sentence includes descriptions about a target gene. We, therefore, replaced the query gene name to "&lt;QUERY GENE&gt;" tag, and the other gene names to "&lt;SUBSTANCE&gt;" tag.</p><p>Although various methods for extracting gene names have already been proposed, these methods need a lot of training data. Therefore, we used the following techniques.</p><p>We used gene names and abbreviated gene names registered in the LocusLink and GOA database <ref type="foot" coords="4,484.31,293.95,3.52,6.34" target="#foot_2">3</ref> for searching gene names.</p><p>Moreover, we applied the following experiential rules to determine gene names and abbreviated gene names.</p><p>• words that are constructed from 3 to 8 characters and are not DNA base pair sequences.</p><p>Next, we detected word sequences not satisfied with the following condition in the word sequences that begin with 'the' and end with '(consonant)+ase', '(consonant)+in', '-tor' or '-ssor' as gene names, except for the following case.</p><p>• containing Stopwords (Stopwords at PubMed<ref type="foot" coords="4,521.16,457.40,3.52,6.34" target="#foot_3">4</ref> and our original stopwords).</p><p>• containing '-ing', '-ed', '.', ';', etc.</p><p>• containing only one parenthesis, '(' or ')'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Stemming Process</head><p>Pattern extraction is possible also from the surface word sequence; however, in the case of, for example, "inhibition of A" and " inhibitor A", these phrases will be treated as different phrases.</p><p>In order to avoid this, we extracted stem patterns after stemming to the word using the Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,506.48,619.91,10.68,9.05" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>For example, the following sentence,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regulation of Fas-associated death domain interactions by the death effector domain identified by a modified reverse two-hybrid screen.</head><p>is stemmed to the following stem sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;regul&gt; &lt;fas-associ&gt; &lt;death&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;interact&gt; &lt;SUBSTANCE&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;identifi&gt; &lt;modifi&gt; &lt;revers&gt; &lt;two-hybrid&gt; &lt;screen&gt;</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Pattern Extraction with Tidal PrefixSpan</head><p>We utilized a hyper geometry distribution score (hgs) for extracting stem sequence patterns that appear exclusively to positive examples. Hisamitsu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,146.49,328.44,11.62,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have proposed a method of weighting words by which the given document set is characterized using an hgs. They showed that words selected by the hgs are effective for standing for the contents of artciles compared with TF-IDF, etc.</p><p>Here, a definition of the score using this supergeometry distribution (hgs) is the probability that more than y samples are positive, when x samples are taken without duplication out of the sample set of n containing positive samples of m. We used -log (hgs) as statistical criteria.</p><p>We extracted patterns using the Tidal PrefixSpan <ref type="bibr" coords="5,275.37,461.42,11.62,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for improvement of speed. PrefixSpan <ref type="bibr" coords="5,215.12,473.37,10.79,8.97" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,228.82,473.37,8.30,8.97" target="#b4">5]</ref> is a high-speed extraction method that can extract high-frequency appearance patterns allowed skips that was proposed by Pei et al.</p><p>For example, from the following sentences, 1. I should point out that we need ... 2. I must point out that it is important ..., PrefixSpan can extract the pattern "I"-"point"-"out"-"that" at a high speed. However, since the original PrefixSpan only takes out high frequency patterns, it is necessary for it to be devised to take out the pattern with high information criteria. Here, we can utilize Tidal SMP (Tidal Statistical Metric Pruning) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,377.12,128.14,10.58,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Tidal SMP is a technique to accelerate counting the number of patterns with an information criteria.</p><p>We used Tidal PrefixSpan, which is a technique of applied Tidal SMP to PrefixSpan, for finding significant patterns with statistically meaning. We used the value of -log(hgs) divided by the pattern length (= 1, 2, 3, ...) as statistical criteria and scoring points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Functional Phrase Output</head><p>We scored all the sentences that included test articles by summing up stem pattern scores. Next, we extracted the sentence with a high score for every part ( title, abstract, body and caption parts ) of the article. Then, we finally selected the output sentence from four sentences by rescoring with weight. Output sentences are basicaly one sentence. If the sentence was long, we outputed a head part of less than 256 characters of the sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Experimental Result</head><p>We scored patterns with a length of three or less and a frequency of two or more in the training data. We then extracted the top 800 patterns with high hgs values using the Tidal PrefixSpan.</p><p>Stem patterns that appear two or more times extracted by Tidal PrefixSpan are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,469.97,450.69,3.74,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>&lt;crystallin&gt; (crystallin), &lt;len&gt; (lens), etc., which seldom generally appear, were extracted from the training set. This is because patterns with low frequency may often get a high value of (-log(hgs) / pattern length).</p><p>We show the patterns extracted with a higher rank in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,336.47,522.54,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref> that appear 100 or more times. This indicates that our method can extract patterns that are likely to appear also in the test data and which are generalized. This shows that the generalized patterns can be extracted with the combination of the cut-off point by frequency and the value using the hyper geometry distribution.</p><p>We evaluated the output results by four improvement Dice coefficients. By average of a total of 139 questions, their scores are CD (Classical Dice) : 48.78%, MUD (Modified Unigram Dice) : 50.39%, BD (Bigram Dice) : 31.49% and BP (Bigram Phrase) : 33.79%.</p><p>Part of the concrete results is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,501.63,654.17,3.74,8.97" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. This is the result of the higher 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 ranked when sorting with the results of the Classic Dice coefficient in 139 questions.</p><p>Even if the output is apparently close to the correct answer, for example, the 50th problem, a low score can be obtained, because predicted phrases are evaluated only until bi-gram. These evaluation methods are also a future work.</p></div>
