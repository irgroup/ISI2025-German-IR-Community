<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many term-weighting models have been proposed for information retrieval. For a given collection and a given query, it is an interesting and challenging problem to automatically select the term-weighting model, which would provide the best retrieval performance. It is referred to as the model selection problem.</p><p>Previous works on the model selection problem, including <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.80,504.48,9.71,8.97" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,68.00,504.48,7.16,8.97" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,79.63,504.48,6.47,8.97">7]</ref>, are based on the analysis of the term-weighting models relevance scores. Therefore, using these approaches, the system cannot select the optimal model prior to the retrieval process.</p><p>On the contrary, our approach to the model selection is a pre-retrieval strategy. For a given query, it automatically selects a term-weighting model without the need to wait for the system's relevance scores.</p><p>Our work for the model selection problem is based on Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen's Divergence From Randomness (DFR) probabilistic framework <ref type="bibr" coords="1,152.20,609.09,9.20,8.97" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. Their framework deploys more .2607 than 50 models for term weighting. However, for a given retrieval task/query, the framework does not have a strategy to single out a model that would provide a reliable performance. Table <ref type="table" coords="1,374.16,532.75,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="1,424.60,532.75,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_1">2</ref> list the mean average precision (MAP) obtained by different models on the TREC-7 and TREC-8 ad-hoc tasks respectively. Here we just list the results given by the most stable and effective models in Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen's framework. As shown by the results, even on the same collection, the optimal model could be different for each task. Also, for each task, the best model could achieve up to 5.65% higher MAP than the poorest one.</p><p>The aim of this study is to test a query-based approach for the selection of the most appropriate term-weighting model. For a given query and a given collection, we propose to automatically select the best performing term-weighting model. For the Robust Track, our assumption is that the proposed pre-retrieval model selection mechanism would improve the poorly-performing queries, by applying a termweighting model that maximises the average precision of each query.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our query-based model selection approach. In Sections 3 and 4, we describe our experimental setup for the Robust Track, and provide the evaluation results and the related analysis. In the experiments, the performance of the proposed model selection approach is particularly assessed. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">QUERY-BASED MODEL SELECTION</head><p>Our query-based model selection mechanism assumes that the performance of a term-weighting model depends on the statistics of the query. Therefore, the statistical features of a query could constitute a good indication for the model selection mechanism.</p><p>Our mechanism involves a training process where the queries are clustered according to their statistical characteristics, and the best term-weighting model for each cluster of queries is obtained by taking previous relevance judgements into consideration. For a given new query, we assign a cluster to the query according to its statistical features, and then apply the term-weighting model associated to the cluster.</p><p>A possible approach to clustering the queries is to take the users' feedback into account, and cluster together the queries for which users have visited similar documents <ref type="bibr" coords="2,275.84,313.16,13.49,8.97" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. However, since the retrieved document are only known after the retrieval process, this approach is not appropriate for our pre-retrieval model selection mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Query Clustering</head><p>We propose a query clustering method that is independent of the retrieval procedure. For each query, we construct a feature vector, then cluster the queries according to the similarity of each vector pair. The underlying problem of this approach is the right choice of the features required to represent a query. In this paper, we propose the following three factors for the feature vector of a query:</p><p>• Query length According to Zhai &amp; Lafferty's work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.95,470.92,13.49,8.97" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, query length has a strong effect on the smoothing methods of language models. In our previous work, we also found that query length heavily affects the length normalisation methods of the probabilistic models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.78,512.76,9.20,8.97" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Therefore, it can be an important feature in the clustering process.</p><p>In this work, we use ρ • ql to represent this feature, where:</p><p>-ρ is a parameter. We experimentally set it to 0.2.</p><p>-ql is the query length, i.e. the number of unique terms in the query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• The difference of the informative amount in the query terms</head><p>To describe the informative amount that a term carries, we usually associate an inverse document frequency (idf ) to the term. The idf factor is a decreasing function of the number of documents containing the term.</p><p>Since the informative amount of a query term is correlated with the utility of a term in the retrieval process, the most informative term in a query, which has the highest idf , is supposed to be the most useful term in discriminating the relevant documents from the others in a collection. On the contrary, the least informative term in a query would add little weight to the relevant documents. Indeed, the least informative term in a query tends to be a "stop-word", which could have a detrimental effect on the retrieval. Hence, the difference of the informative amount among the query terms can be an important feature of a query.</p><p>In this work, this difference is defined as the quotient of the minimum idf divided by the maximum idf among the query terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,388.49,215.49,116.95,20.86">γ = idfmin idfmax = log(nt,max/N ) log(nt,min/N )</formula><p>where:</p><p>-γ is the factor representing the distribution of the informative amount in the query terms.</p><p>-idfmax and idfmax are the minimum and maximum idf among the query terms respectively.</p><p>-nt is the number of documents containing a particular query term t.</p><p>-nt,max and nt,min are the maximum and minimum nt among the query terms respectively.</p><p>-N is the number of documents in the whole collection.</p><p>• The clarity/ambiguity of a query In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,351.92,416.67,9.20,8.97" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, Cronen-Townsend et. al. proposed the clarity score of a query to measure the coherence of the language usage in documents, whose models are likely to generate the query. In their definition, the clarity of a query is the sum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability of generating each term in the vocabulary from the query and from the whole collection.</p><p>Another clue for the clarity of a query is the size of the document set containing (at least one of) the query terms. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,382.17,525.66,9.20,8.97" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, Plachouras et. al. suggested that it is an important property of a query.</p><p>In this work, we follow the idea in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.99,550.97,9.20,8.97" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, and use</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,411.21,579.52,71.50,20.86">ω = - log(n q/N ) log N</formula><p>to represent the clarity a query, where:</p><p>-N is again the number of documents in the whole collection.</p><p>-n q is the number of documents containing (at least one of) the query terms.</p><p>Thus, when n q is small, we will obtain a large ω value, which implies that the query is very specific, and therefore is of high clarity.</p><p>As a consequence, the feature vector qf for a query is given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,139.54,94.40,67.56,8.97">qf = (ρ • ql, γ, ω)</formula><p>Finally, the feature vectors have to be clustered. A specific similarity measure, and a clustering algorithm need to be specified. In this work, we use the cosine of the angle between two feature vectors in the above three-dimensional space and the agglomerating hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.90,163.14,14.31,8.97" target="#b11">[11]</ref> for the clustering process. In the AHC algorithm, initially, each vector is an independent cluster. The similarity between two clusters is measured by the cosine similarity of their centroids. If we have n vectors to be processed, we start with n clusters. Then, we merge the closest pair of clusters (according to the cosine similarity measure) as a single cluster. The merging process is repeated until it results in k clusters. Here the number k of clusters is the halting criterion of the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Model Selection Mechanism</head><p>Based on the query clustering method introduced in the previous section, our model selection mechanism can be summarised as follows:</p><p>• We cluster a set of training queries according to their intrinsic features, as proposed in the previous section.</p><p>• For each cluster, we select the best-performing model in terms of the precision/recall measures.</p><p>• Then for a new query, we assign its closest cluster and trigger the best-performing model associated to the assigned cluster.</p><p>The proposed mechanism aims to optimise the average precision for each query, which leads to a maximised overall performance for all the queries.</p><p>In Sections 3 and 4, we describe our experimental setting for the Robust Track, and provide the evaluation results and the related analysis. The experiments aim to evaluate the proposed model selection mechanism, especially its performance on the poorly-performing queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</head><p>The document collection used in the Robust Track is the disk4 and disk5 (no CR database) of the TREC collections.</p><p>The 100 topics given by TREC for the Robust Track have two parts. The first part consists of the 50 poorly-performing queries of the TREC-6, 7, 8 ad-hoc tasks, namely 50 old queries. The remaining part consists of 50 new queries introduced by the Robust Track.</p><p>Each query consists of 3 fields: title, description and narrative. As required, we use only the description field.</p><p>Two different query sets are used as the training set of the model selection mechanism, i.e. the 50 old queries and the 100 queries of the TREC-7, 8 ad-hoc tasks. The latter includes 35 queries of the former.</p><p>For the experiments, our model selection mechanism involves 11 term-weighting models developed within Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen's DFR probabilistic framework. These models are: I(n exp)C2, I(n)L2, I(n)B2, I(n)B2, I(n exp)B2, BL2 , I(F)B2, I(n exp)L2, BB2, PL2 and PB2. An effective and stable length normalisation method, i.e. the normalisation 2, is applied in these models. The details of these models and the normalisation 2 can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,513.14,77.96,9.20,8.97" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In our experiments for the Robust Track, the model selection mechanism was evaluated through 6 runs (5 official runs and 1 additional run). Also, its performance with or without the use of query expansion was tested. The runs are designed as follows (Table <ref type="table" coords="3,425.00,130.26,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_2">3</ref> lists the IDs of the runs, Sel78 was the additional run):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,330.14,160.45,42.85,8.97">• InexpC2</formula><p>This is the baseline. It applies a single model, i.e. the I(n exp)C2 model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,434.88,185.03,9.20,8.97" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, for all the queries. The I(n exp)C2 model is developed within Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen's DFR framework and is considered as an effective and robust model on the collection used in this Robust Track. Its formula is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,355.63,254.16,178.44,20.85">w(t, d) = F + 1 nt • (tf ne + 1) tf ne • log 2 N + 1 ne + 0.5</formula><p>where:</p><p>-w(t, d) is the weight of the term t in the document d.</p><p>-F is the term frequency of the term t in the whole collection.</p><p>-nt is the document frequency of the term t.</p><p>-N is the number of documents in the collection.</p><p>-ne is given by N</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,419.00,381.20,70.93,12.10">• 1 -(1 -n t N ) F .</formula><p>-tf ne is the normalised term frequency. It is given by the modified version of the normalisation 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,543.47,406.94,9.20,8.97" target="#b1">[1]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="3,400.10,432.42,151.87,20.85">tf n = tf • log e (1 + c • avg l l ) (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="3,551.97,438.23,3.92,8.97">)</formula><p>where c is a parameter; l and avg l are the document length of the document d and the average document length in the collection respectively; tf is the raw term frequency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Sel50 and Sel78</head><p>In order to compare our query-based model selection mechanism to the baseline, we proposed two runs. The two runs use different training queries sets. Sel50 uses the 50 poorly-performing queries (50 old queries), and Sel78 uses the 100 queries of the TREC-7, 8 ad-hoc tasks. Thus, the effect of the training set on the model selection mechanism performance could be tested. We experimentally set the halting criterion of our query clustering method to k = 4 for Sel50, and k = 3 for Sel78.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• InexpC2QE</head><p>We also tested the model selection mechanism with the use of a query expansion methodology. This run constitutes our baseline for the runs applying the query expansion methodology. The run InexpC2QE applies I(n exp)C2 and a query expansion methodology for all the queries. The query expansion methodology follows the idea of measuring divergence from randomness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,280.44,158.07,9.20,8.97" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The approach can be seen as a generalisation of the approach used by Carpineto and Romano in which they applied the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the un-expanded version of BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,200.31,199.91,9.20,8.97" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. For each query, we extract the 40 most informative terms from the top 10 retrieved documents as the expanded terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Sel50QE and Sel78QE</head><p>Both the runs Sel50QE and Sel78QE use the same setting as the runs Sel50 and Sel78 for model selection. However, they also apply the query expansion mechanism for each query. Moreover, we experimentally set the halting criterion of our query clustering method to k = 4 for Sel50QE, and k = 2 for Sel78QE.</p><p>The parameter c of the normalisation 2 (see Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,281.18,325.37,3.83,8.97" target="#formula_6">1</ref>)) was estimated by our new tuning approach, which measures the normalisation effect on the term frequency distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="4,53.80,356.75,9.20,8.97" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Using this tuning approach, we automatically set the parameter to c = 1.96.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>There are mainly three quantitatives measures that could be used to evaluate the experiments in the Robust Track: #Rel: The number of queries with no retrieved relevant documents in the top 10 ranks, computed over the complete set of queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAP(X):</head><p>The area under the curve when MAP (mean average precision) of the worst X queries is plotted against X.</p><p>MAP: The mean average precision over the complete set of queries.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,92.06,543.21,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,118.31,543.21,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref> list the results of our runs. Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,269.87,543.21,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_5">6</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,53.80,553.68,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_6">7</ref> list the involved models in the model selection process and the performance of each single model over all the 100 queries. From the tables, we can see that MAP(X) is quite low in all the cases. Therefore, we mainly compare the MAP and #Rel measures of the runs.</p><p>As shown by the results, for the poorly-performing queries, using the 50 old queries as the training query set, Sel50 and Sel50QE achieve better MAP and #Rel than InexpC2 and InexpC2QE respectively (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,201.69,637.36,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,227.27,637.36,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Using more training queries, for the poorly-performing queries, the performance of Sel78 is nearly the same as InexpC2 (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,138.18,668.74,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Moreover, with query expansion, Sel78QE outperforms InexpC2QE (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,237.07,679.20,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Compared to all the 6 runs, we can see that Sel78QE achieves the highest MAP over all the 100 queries (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,53.80,710.58,4.60,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,79.38,710.58,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). The run Sel78QE results into the constitution of two query clusters, to which the models PL2 and I(n exp)B2 are associated respectively (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,446.76,369.29,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). It is encouraging to see that although I(n exp)B2 has a better performance in terms of MAP than PL2 does (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,461.96,390.21,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_6">7</ref>), using PL2 for most of the queries (i.e. 86 out of 100), and I(n exp)B2 for the rest, our model selection mechanism achieves even higher MAP. This observation suggests that the performance of a term-weighting model is dependent on the statistics of the query. Indeed, with the use of query expansion, this run (i.e. Sel78QE) outperforms the use of each single model indifferently for all the 100 queries (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,502.69,463.44,3.58,8.97" target="#tab_6">7</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, it seems that the query expansion methodology significantly improves the MAP, but has detrimental effect on the poorly-performing queries in terms of #Rel.</p><p>The performance of the query expansion methodology could be explained by its underlying assumption. It assumes that the top 10 ranked documents are highly relevant, then extracts the 40 most informative terms from them as the expanded query terms. Therefore, for the poorly-performing queries, the top 10 returned documents are likely to give false relevance information. As a consequence, the poorlyperforming queries lead to the failure of the query expansion methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In the Robust Track, we mainly evaluated our query-based model selection mechanism based on query clustering. The performance of the model selection mechanism was tested with two different training query sets and, with or without query expansion.</p><p>According to the evaluation results, if a proper training query set is used, our query-based term-weighting model selection does improve the performance of the poorly-performing queries compared to the baseline, where a unique term- weighting model has been applied uniformly to all queries. Moreover, it seems that query expansion has detrimental effect on the poorly-performing queries, although it achieves a significantly higher average precision measure over all the 100 queries. This observation can be explained by the underlying mechanism of the query expansion methodology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="1,316.81,239.37,238.98,103.51"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The mean average precision (MAP) for the TREC-7 ad-hoc task on the disk4, 5 (No CR) of the TREC collections using 11 different DFR models.</figDesc><table coords="1,363.09,270.75,146.48,72.13"><row><cell>Model</cell><cell cols="3">MAP Model MAP</cell></row><row><cell>I(F)B2</cell><cell>.1985</cell><cell>PL2</cell><cell>.1894</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">I(n exp)L2 .1937</cell><cell>PB2</cell><cell>.1906</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">I(n exp)C2 .2001</cell><cell>BB2</cell><cell>.1985</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">I(n exp)B2 .1986 I(n)B2 .1987</cell></row><row><cell>I(n)L2</cell><cell>.1958</cell><cell>BL2</cell><cell>.1932</cell></row><row><cell>I(F)L2</cell><cell>.1933</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
