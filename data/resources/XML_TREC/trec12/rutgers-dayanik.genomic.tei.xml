<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the MEDLINE articles that describe functions of particular genes. We describe our experiments using the mg system and the partitioning of a graph of biological sequences, structures and abstracts. We participated in the primary task of the TREC 2003 Genomics Track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Computational biology deals with a wide range of entities, including DNA sequences, protein sequences, protein structures, gene functions and academic publications. Databases of these entities include explicit links between them. For example, MEDLINE abstracts often reference sequences and structures that are relevant to the publication. Sequences are related to the structures of the proteins that they encode. Sequences are also related to homologous sequences in other organisms. In this paper, we explore how these relationships can be used to enhance retrieval of relevant MEDLINE abstracts. Our intuition is this: two abstracts may not share a significant number of common terms, but if they are both connected to many common sequences and structures, then a researcher interested in one abstract should be alerted to the existence of the other.</p><p>An assumption of our work is that recall is more important than precision. In the context of a professional investigation, researchers are willing to spend more time evaluating possible relevant literature than, say, the average web searcher is willing to spend on evaluating pages returned from a casual search. In other words, the cost of a false negative is much higher than the cost of a false positive.</p><p>To test this idea, we create a graph of biological entities, where edges are defined by the explicit links between them. We then partition the graph to find clusters of topologically related entities, including abstracts. Finally, these clusters are used to adjust the ranking of abstracts returned by a simple text retrieval engine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Primary Task</head><p>The primary task of the genomics track was an ad hoc information retrieval problem: For a given gene X, find all MEDLINE articles that focus on the basic biology of the gene X or its protein products. Basic biology includes isolation, structure, genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states <ref type="bibr" coords="2,283.35,303.84,10.91,9.57" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The relevance judgements were obtained from the LocusLink database <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.83,321.45,16.00,9.57" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. A portion of a sample LocusLink entry is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,499.04,321.45,4.24,9.57" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A LocusLink entry contains references to MEDLINE database as well as brief descriptions of gene functions extracted from the MEDLINE articles. These references are called GeneRIF (Gene References Into Function). In the example shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,365.09,374.29,4.24,9.57" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the unique PubMed identifier 12482586 and the description attached to it define a GeneRIF in the LocusLink database for the gene EIF4E of the organism Homo sapiens. GeneRIFs were used as query relevants -qrels in the TREC terminology.  LocusLink entries, and consisted of 50 queries each. Each query was specific to a gene, and chosen from the LocusLink database with gene identifiers such as official gene name, official symbol, alias symbol, organism, etc. For an overview of the track, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.72,712.40,10.91,9.57" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data Sources</head><p>We used several genomics resources in addition to the provided MEDLINE collection. In this section, we will briefly describe the data sources we used to construct a graph. MEDLINE: MEDLINE is a digital collection of life science literature consisting of over twelve million abstracts together with some additional information associated with each abstract such as manually assigned MeSH terms and chemical names. Moreover, there are links from MEDLINE abstracts to the sequences and structures that the article discuss.</p><p>GenBank: GenBank is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences. Bibliographic references to MEDLINE articles are included for all published sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Swiss-Prot:</head><p>The Swiss Protein Database (Swiss-Prot) is a curated protein sequence database <ref type="bibr" coords="3,72.00,316.93,10.91,9.57" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The Swiss-Prot entries are cross-referenced to several other databases, including MEDLINE, PROSITE and the PDB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PDB and Ligands:</head><p>The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains 3-D structural data of biological macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,315.01,369.77,10.91,9.57" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The PDB entries also contain references to small molecules, known as ligands. We used PDB structures as well as ligands to connect PDB structures based on their binding patterns. The PDB entries are also cross-referenced to the primary citations in MEDLINE and other databases including ENZYME and Swiss-Prot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCOP:</head><p>The SCOP database provides a hierarchical classification of all proteins whose structure is known, including all entries in the PDB <ref type="bibr" coords="3,333.73,457.84,16.01,9.57" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We represented the leaves of the SCOP hierarchy in our graph to be able to connect to the PDB structures. PROSITE: PROSITE is a database of protein families and domains <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.90,493.07,10.91,9.57" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It consists of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles. PROSITE provides cross-references to Swiss-Prot, PDB and ENZYME databases. ENZYME: ENZYME is a repository of information relative to the nomenclature of enzymes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.49,563.52,10.91,9.57" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. ENZYME provides explicit links to Swiss-Prot and the PDB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Constructing the Graph</head><p>We construct a weighted undirected graph where nodes correspond to entries from the databases listed in Section 3, including MEDLINE abstracts, DNA and protein sequences from GenBank and SwissProt, structures from PDB, patterns from PROSITE, classifications from SCOP and ENZYME, and chemical names from MEDLINE abstracts. Edges correspond to explicit links between entries encoded in the databses, e.g. the sequence annotations in MEDLINE abstracts. Some nodes in the graph have high degree. Papers that describe genomic sequencing, for example, often reference all the sequences produced by the project. In these cases, the individual edges are not highly significant -the relationship between sequences from the same organism is not strong. So we assign these edges low weight. We assign weights to edges as follows. Let (u, v) be an edge in the graph. Then, the weight of the edge (u, v), w(u, v), is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,219.09,210.67,302.91,24.43">w(u, v) = min 1 n(u, v) , 1 n(v, u)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where n(u, v) is defined as the number of edges between u and all other vertices of same type as vertex v, and n(v, u) is defined as the number of edges between v and all other vertices of same type as vertex u.</p><p>As an example, consider a relation between the article A 1 and the sequence S 1 . Let us say A 1 is related to 10 sequences in total, and S 1 is one of them. Also, assume that S 1 is related to 4 articles in total. Therefore, we will have an edge (u, v) corresponding to the relation between the article A 1 and the sequence S 1 in our graph with weight 1/10 since min(1/10, 1/4) = 1/10.</p><p>Note that, for this particular example, when we compute the weight, we take into account only article-sequence relationships. In general, we consider the same type of relationships to compute edge-weights. We think that normalization is a fair method for assigning edge-weights because some objects are related to too many other objects of the same type and some only to a few.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Graph Partitioning</head><p>The objective of graph partitioning is to partition vertices of a graph in k equal subsets such that the total weight of edges connecting different subsets is minimized, thereby each subset is highly similar. The graph partitioning problem is NP-complete, but good heuristics exist.</p><p>We employed a partitioning approach based on multilevel recursive bisection <ref type="bibr" coords="4,453.01,557.46,10.91,9.57" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. First, the size of the graph is reduced by collapsing nodes and edges to a few thousand nodes. Then the smaller graph is partitioned into two parts. Partitioning is repeated by uncoarsening each part one level up until all k subsets are obtained. We used publicly available graph partitioning software, METIS <ref type="bibr" coords="4,156.78,627.92,10.91,9.57" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Run Descriptions</head><p>We employed the mg system as our retrieval engine <ref type="bibr" coords="4,322.03,695.80,11.52,9.57" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,337.56,695.80,12.73,9.57" target="#b11">12]</ref>. We submitted two official runs to the Genomics track. The first run was done using only the mg system while the second run was obtained by reordering the retrieved abstracts by mg using the clusters of abstracts defined by the graph partitions.</p><p>Run using mg: We indexed the following sections from the MEDLINE abstracts: title, abstract, MeSH terms and chemical names. We slightly modified mg to be able to tokenize biological terms properly. It currently forms words as a sequence of letters, digits and the following special characters: (, ), [, ], ', -, ',' and /. Note that these special characters cannot be the first or last character of the word. It is clear that these special characters appear in gene names and synonyms. For example, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin, dead/h and cyclin-dependent are now treated as single indexing terms.</p><p>mg performed case-folding but not stemming. Query parsing was done identically to document parsing. We formed queries from the gene names and synonyms. We eliminated duplicate words and stopwords from the queries. The mg system includes support for ranked queries, where similarity is evaluated using the cosine measure. We issued ranked queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run using mg but ordering results by clusters:</head><p>The graph is disconnected, with one large graph of about 500,000 nodes, and 224,440 smaller graphs, the largest of which has 1,500 nodes. The smaller graphs are considered single clusters. The large graph is partitioned to produce 5000 clusters of about 100 nodes each.</p><p>In this run, we first obtained the search results using mg, and then grouped them by clusters.</p><p>We assigned each group the highest mg score in that cluster. We ordered the groups first by group scores, and then in each group, by the mg scores. The intuitive idea of reranking mg search results is that if it can identify some qrels at the top ranked results, we can push more qrels to the top results by using the additional information about their relatedness, i.e., being in the same cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>This section reports our results obtained using the mg system and the clusters. The orginal mg achieved a mean average precision (MAP) of 0.2759 whereas the modified mg achieved a MAP of 0.3054 on the training data. Since the modified version increased the performance in terms of MAP, all the results reported for the test data were obtained by the modified version of mg.</p><p>While mg achieved a MAP of 0.3054 on the training data, ranking mg search results by clusters achieved a MAP of 0.3191. However, the mean average precisions for mg and using clusters are 0.1652 and 16.36, respectively, on the test data.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,124.11,691.35,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_2">1</ref> compares mg for the top 1000 retrieved articles to the best and median systems using the test data. In general, our performance is close to that of the median systems. We tried to understand the possible reasons for this low performance, and noticed that retrieval is quite sensitive to query formulations. For example, for test topic 7, the mg system identified only one qrel as relevant out of four known qrels for this topic. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,431.99,147.60,4.24,9.57" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, mg exhibits very low performance for topic 7 compared to the other participating systems. The reason is that the query for this topic includes "syndecan 4", however, three qrels contain only "syndecan-4", and only one qrel contains both "syndecan" and "syndecan-4". We indexed "syndecan-4" as a single word for those three qrels, and therefore mg cannot locate them when the query is "syndecan 4". In fact, when we change the query to include only "syndecan-4" (even omitting gene symbols), mg identified all four qrels as the 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th documents. Another example is that "1,25-dihydroxyvitamin" appears in MEDLINE abstracts, whereas test topic 12 expresses it with an additional space, i.e. as"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin", thereby breaking it up into two words. Therefore, different variations of gene names and symbols are an important issue to be considered when preparing queries.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,122.86,341.35,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_2">1</ref> also compares mg and ranking using clusters for the top 100 retrieved articles using the test data. As can be seen from the figure, ranking by clusters significantly improved the MAP for eight queries, but significantly decreased for the other eight queries. However, upon manual inspection, we find out that many qrels fall into same clusters. We believe that clusters can be useful for researchers by itself or in conjunction with a retrieval method to support browsing similar entities.  We analyzed one cluster to assess its quality. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,355.23,689.48,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_5">2</ref> shows the qrels and their corresponding clusters for test topic 3. Test topic 3 have thirteen qrels, and eleven of them fall into same cluster (the other two that fall into two other separate clusters are PMID 12167712 and PMID 12186496). We picked the cluster containing these eleven qrels. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,447.85,129.98,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_6">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="7,478.44,129.98,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_7">4</ref> present the Chemical names, PDB and GenBank entries in this cluster. These figures aslo show the descriptive words extracted automatically from the MEDLINE abstracts in the cluster based on the word frequencies in the cluster and in the entire corpus of MEDLINE articles.</p><p>Our scientific domain expert carefully analyzed this cluster and found it to be highly relevant to the gene of interest, eukaryotic initiation factor 4e (eif4e). The descriptive words are meaningful with respect to the eif4e gene and to the biological pathway within which the eif4e protein is involved. The chemical names are also relevant to the mechanism of eif4e and all of the associated PDB macromolecular structures contain the eif4e protein. In addition, approximately 60% of the Swiss-Prot and GenBank sequences in this cluster are relevant to one another in that they all play a role in the biological process of protein synthesis.</p><p>Let us summarize the expert's analysis of this cluster: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>Our primary goal was to demonstrate to the Information Retrieval and Bioinformatics communities experiments that involved the open-source mg system and graph partitioning for an information retrieval problem in genomics. Our results are close to the median performance of the participating systems in the Genomics track. Even though we observed some high-quality clusters, we did not obtain a significant improvement over mg alone using our clusters for retrieval purposes. In the future, we plan to carry out more experiments in order to better understand the quality of the clusters. Moreover, we want to try other retrieval methods together with our clusters in order to determine how the initial retrieval method affects the performance of the retrieval using clusters. We also want to investigate the effects of creating clusters during the retrieval process from the neighborhood graphs of retrieved abstracts.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,83.25,453.11,78.51,8.77;2,83.25,468.65,131.76,8.77;2,83.25,484.19,144.36,8.77;2,83.25,499.73,321.18,8.77;2,83.25,515.27,127.07,8.77;2,83.25,530.84,8.31,8.74;2,83.25,546.36,377.57,8.77;2,83.25,561.90,422.09,8.77;2,83.25,577.47,8.31,8.74"><head>LOCUSID: 1977 ORGANISM :</head><label>1977:</label><figDesc>Homo sapiens OFFICIAL SYMBOL: EIF4E OFFICIAL GENE NAME: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ALIAS SYMBOL: EIF-4E ...
