<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The TREC 2003 web track consisted of both a non-interactive stream and an interactive stream. Both streams worked with the .GOV test collection. The non-interactive stream continued an investigation into the importance of homepages in Web ranking, via both a Topic Distillation task and a Navigational task. In the topic distillation task, systems were expected to return a list of the homepages of sites relevant to each of a series of broad queries. This differs from previous homepage experiments in that queries may have multiple correct answers. The navigational task required systems to return a particular desired web page as early as possible in the ranking in response to queries. In half of the queries, the target answer was the homepage of a site and the query was derived from the name of the site (Homepage finding) while in the other half, the target answers were not homepages and the queries were derived from the name of the page (Named page finding). The two types of query were arbitrarily mixed and not identified.</p><p>The interactive stream focused on human participation in a topic distillation task over the .GOV collection. Studies conducted by the two participating groups compared a search engine using automatic topic distillation features with the same engine with those features disabled in order to determine whether the automatic topic distillation features assisted the users in the performance of their tasks and whether humans could achieve better results than the automatic system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part I</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-interactive Experiments 1 Introduction</head><p>The non-interactive stream of the TREC 2003 Web Track centred on two tasks: a topic distillation task and a navigational task. The tasks use the 18 gigabyte, 1.25 million document partial crawl of the .gov domain, distributed on CD-ROM as the .GOV collection<ref type="foot" coords="1,313.74,660.51,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . A full description of this year's track guidelines is available in a separate document in these proceedings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Tasks</head><p>This year's tasks represent two types of search where it is important for the system to be able to return homepages.</p><p>A homepage is designed to be the main page of a site. The homepage is important because it is often the first page users will see. It provides an introduction to the site, who created it and what it contains. It usually links to other pages in the site and provides access to other site functions such as search. The homepage URL is often given as the URL of the whole site, as in 'the TREC site is at http://trec.nist.gov/'.</p><p>In previous years Track participants have developed effective methods for homepage finding. Linkbased ranking methods including anchortext propagation are useful, because homepages tend to have higher inlink counts than non-homepages. URL-based ranking is also useful, since homepages tend to have short URLs. This year, such evidence might be expected to be useful in processing topic distillation queries and for some of the navigational queries. In this year's navigational task, the hompepage queries were mixed with an equal number of queries designed to find named pages which were not site homepages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Topic Distillation Task</head><p>The topic distillation task involves finding relevant homepages, given a broad query. The need underlying the query 'cotton industry' might be 'give me an overview of .gov sites about the cotton industry, by listing their homepages'. See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,231.99,347.49,3.88,8.74">1</ref>.</p><p>This differs from an adhoc-style interpretation 'give me all pages in .gov about the cotton industry'. Adhoc querying would facilitate direct access to a much larger number of pages, but topic distillation gives a better overview of which sites exist and therefore which government labs, groups and programs have sites.</p><p>It also differs from past Web track homepage finding tasks in that queries do not identify a specific site. To illustrate the difference, a homepage finding query in the 'cotton industry' area might be 'cotton pathology research unit'.</p><p>The topics were numbered 1-50. A good homepage will correspond to a site which:</p><p>• Is principally devoted to the topic,</p><p>• Provides credible information on the topic, and</p><p>• Is not part of a larger site also principally devoted to the topic This requires judges to understand the structure of the site in question and the quality of information offered, and identify its homepage. We have more emphasis on homepageness than in last year's topic distillation task, and also have used broader queries to ensure that at least some sites exist. Because many topics had less than 10 results, we abandoned the precision at 10 measure (P@10). The main measure was R-Precision (P@n where n is the number of relevant documents for the current topic).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Navigational Task</head><p>The navigational task is also known as the 'home/named page finding task'. Each query involves finding a particular page, which is a homepage in 50% of queries (participants did not know which queries were for homepages and which were for non-homepages). The query asks for the page by name. For example, when looking for the homepage http://www.tva.gov the user might type the query 'TVA-Tennessee Valley Authority'. When looking for the page http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/enforce.htm, they might type the query 'ADA Enforcement'. See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,259.29,688.66,3.88,8.74">2</ref>.</p><p>Within the framework of this task, a number of research questions can be addressed, including:</p><p>1. Do systems tuned for homepage finding also work well on the named page finding task? 3. Is it possible to identify homepage finding queries within a query stream?</p><p>Topics were numbered 151-450, with 150 homepage and 150 named page queries. For measures, we use the mean reciprocal rank of the first correct answer (MRR) and the proportion of queries where the correct answer appears in the top 10 (S@10). The number 10 was chosen for success rate calculation because search engines often provide 10 answers in the first page of search results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Topic Distillation Results</head><p>Across the 50 topics, 516 pages were judged relevant (average of 10.32 pages per query). Results for the best run submitted by each group are in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,278.92,532.84,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. A full listing of runs is in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,431.87,532.84,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref>.</p><p>Because there were only a few good answers for each query, system scores were low. This also seemed to reduce the stability of the results. The list of top 5 groups depends on how we sort Table <ref type="table" coords="4,493.89,556.75,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. The top groups by R-Precision are in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,244.27,568.70,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Top groups by MAP were: CSIRO, Hummingbird, Neuchatel, UAmsterdam and UGlasgow. Top groups by P@10 were: Hummingbird, CSIRO, IBM Haifa, MSR Asia and UGlasgow.</p><p>Here we briefly summarize the information available about the experiments conducted by the top five groups (based on R-Precision).</p><p>CSIRO Documents scored via a linear combination of link indegree, anchortext propagation, URL Length and BM25. Linear combination (and BM25 parameters) were tuned using a home page finding query set (same tuning as navigational csiro03ki02). Stemming improved R-Precision by a further 0.0198.</p><p>Hummingbird Documents were given additional weight if their URL looked like a homepage URL, and also based on query word/phrase occurences in HTML markup such as title. There was no use of link counts or anchor text. Stemming had little effect.</p><p>UAmsterdam Used different representations and retrieval models. Okapi worked well on documents, titles and anchors. Language modelling worked very well on anchors and less well on documents and titles. Anchor text was important. Snowball stemming was used in all runs.</p><p>Copernic URL information was important (length and presence of query terms). Representations were each treated differently and included documents, extracted summaries, text with formatting, URL and title. First results were from a boolean AND query, followed by OR results. Porter stemming was used in all runs.</p><p>USunderland Used a novel document representation based on automatically assigned word senses as opposed to terms. The ranking algorithm consisted of a variation of Kleinberg's model of hubs and authorities in association with a number of vector space techniques including TF*IDF, and Cosine Similarity.</p><p>Based on information from these and other participants:</p><p>• Referring anchor text was important.</p><p>• Stemming was often helpful. Query expansion (blind feedback) was usually not necessary.</p><p>• URL information and link structure were helpful in several cases.</p><p>• Topic distillation was noted to bear some relationship to homepage finding, in terms of "what works". The small number of good answers for each query caused the measures to be much less stable than they have been in previous years. For P@10, systems should differ by at least 0.035 in absolute score for a 95% confidence in the difference, using the method of Voorhees and Buckley <ref type="bibr" coords="6,407.30,112.02,52.70,8.74">(SIGIR 2002</ref>). An absolute increase of 0.035 represents a 27.3% relative improvement over the top score, which is quite large. For R-Precision, the minimum absolute difference is 0.09. These differences represent quite a large swath of the full range of scores achieved.</p><p>The reason for this instability is as follows. Since more than half of the topics have less than 10 relevant, P@10 is always less than 1.0 for those topics, and so there's this overall degradation in the average due to those topics. The scores are also somewhat quantized, you don't see a continuous range of P@10. On the other hand, R-Precision has even more severe quantization, even though it averages better. Moreover, when there are less than 10 relevant documents, P@10 is an easier measure for systems to do well on than R-Precision, because they have more chances to get those documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Navigational Results</head><p>Judging involved identifying answers which appear at more than one URL. For example, the page http: //bernie.house.gov/imf/imf.asp also appears at http://www.bernie.house.gov/imf/imf.asp so both were identified as correct answers for query 335. This process identified 19 queries with 2 URLs and 12 with more than 2.  effective. Incorporating HP tuning was always harmful (in the combined tuning and in combinations via interleaving and CombSUM).</p><p>Neuchatel Document surrogates were 1) title with anchors from the current document, 2) title with anchors from referring documents and 3) various other segments of referring documents (title, h1, big). Scoring was with Okapi plus a proximity scoring function. Tuning was of the relative weight of surrogates, Okapi b parameter and the degree of proximity upweighting.</p><p>IIT Document surrogates were full text, title and anchors. Fusion was by CombMNZ with exponential z-score normalisation. A query task classification system was also employed, based on 32 words indicative of home page search such as 'home' or 'homepage'.</p><p>MSR Asia Document surrogates such as anchors and titles were employed, whose combination was tuned based on TREC-2002. Proximity information was used.</p><p>Based on information from these and other participants:</p><p>• It seems useful to consider different representations/surrogates based on document structure and including referring anchor text.</p><p>• Link structure gave mixed results.</p><p>• Stemming was not necessary for most participants.</p><p>• Several participants reported improvements based on proximity information, spans, phrases and fuzzy phrases.</p><p>• Few or no big wins from query classification (HP vs NP), but some promising attempts.</p><p>The scores for the navigational task are very stable. For the MRR measure on the full topic set, an absolute difference of 0.04 is enough to give 95% confidence. A 0.1 difference is reliable with as few as 100 topics.</p><p>There is only a little bit of a difference between named pages and homepages. If one uses the named page set alone, one needs to see an absolute difference between 0.06 and 0.07 for 95% confidence. For home pages, it's 0.06. If you pick 150 topics randomly from the larger set, it's 0.07, so the topic type does matter for the evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>This year's topic distillation task was considered to be much more representative of real Web search than last year's. We also ran our first mixed query task, identifying approaches which work for home page and named page finding. Several groups attempted classification to differentiate between query types. More comprehensive mixed query tasks -possibly including topic distillation, topic relevance, service finding and navigational queries -seem to offer fertile ground for future evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part II</head><p>Interactive Experiments</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Introduction</head><p>For TREC 2003, the interactive track was a sub-track of the web track. The topic distillation, one of the web track tasks, has been selected as the interactive track task. The main motivation of the interactive sub-track was to investigate the role of human searchers in the topic distillation task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Tasks</head><p>Eight search topics were selected from the topic set as used by the web topic distillation task. For each of these topics, a search scenario was provided in order to provide the participants a context for their search activity -it was not intended to boost the content available for searching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Title: cotton industry</head><p>Search task: You are to construct a resource list for high school students who are interested in cotton industry, from growing, harvesting cotton and turning it into cloth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Title: folk art folk music</head><p>Search task: Assume that you are an art teacher of a high school. You are about to introduce your students to U.S. folk art and folk music. Please prepare a list of bookmarks for your students for study materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Title: children's literature</head><p>Search task: The teachers from your local primary school are spending a lot of their time on the web to search for materials on children's literature. Please help the teachers by setting up a children's literature web guide which points to useful websites for young readers/writers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Title: wireless communications</head><p>Search task: You are invited to give a presentation on wireless communication to university students. Please prepare a list of bookmarks as a handout to your audience. The bookmarks should cover information on existing and planned uses, research/technology, regulations and legislative interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Title: arctic exploration</head><p>Search task: Assume that you are a high school student and working on an arctic exploration project. You are asked to collect some resources from the web for your project team on what kinds of exploration of the arctic are underway, especially of glaciers and ice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Title: weather hazards and extremes</head><p>Search task: Assume that you are a high school student and working on a project regarding the study of natural/weather hazards and extremes. You are asked to collect some resources from the web for your project team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Title: electric automobiles</head><p>Search task: You are going to give a seminar on the progress in producing/developing electric automobiles, and you will mention some online resources on this topic. Please prepare a list of bookmarks as a handout to your audience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Title: Bilingual education</head><p>Search task: You are a volunteer of your local community. You are asked to help to create a guide to all online information on bilingual education that may be of interest to your local residents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Search Systems</head><p>NIST provided the access to its server with the two versions of "Panoptic search engine". One version of the engine is optimized for the topic distillation task by balancing relevance and homepageness. The other, content-oriented, version is Okapi-based and retruns page in descending order of likely relevance. However, participants were free to use any appropriate search engine. To keep consistent with the automatic topic distillation task, all searches and browses were restricted to the .GOV collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Experimental Protocol</head><p>Participants were free to use any experimental protocol that suits their experimental purpose. However, the guidelines suggested an experiment design proposed by Rutgers group. Similar to the experiment designs in past interactive tracks, this design allows the comparison of two systems or system variants. This year's design divides the eight topics into two blocks, with varying order of topics within each block. This design requires a minimum 16 searchers, each searcher needs to search a block of four topics on one system and another block on another system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Evaluation</head><p>The saved lists from each search session were gathered and sent to NIST for assessment. The assessment was based on four criteria: relevance, depth, coverage, and repetition. The assessors were asked to answer the following questions/statement on a five-point Likert scale.</p><p>Relevance: The page is relevant for the topic. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Overview of Results</head><p>Two groups, CSIRO and Rutgers, participated in this sub-track. Here is a brief description of their testing hypotheses and initial findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.1">CSIRO</head><p>CSIRO investigated the effectiveness of a task tailored delivery method to assist searchers evaluate and thus select key resource pages as described by the topic distillation task.</p><p>In their baseline interface, they used the delivery interface from the Panoptic topic distillation engine which provides searchers with a ranked list of potential relevant key resource pages. In their testing interface, they designed a site summary interface and a sitemap interface to explicitly support searchers to judge whether a site is relevant and whether a page is at the right scope.</p><p>From their initial analysis, they found that their searchers preferred the testing interface and perceived that they fulfilled their task better by using the testing interface than the baseline interface. However, they didn't find any significant difference between the two interfaces on searcher's performance in terms of relevance, depth, coverage and repetition. By further examining searchers' behavior, they found that the interface for grouping documents into sites changed search behavior: searchers tend to assess a number of pages from the same site by reading their summary information before they selected a page to read further. Also in the post-system questionnaire, the searchers strongly stated that the grouping interface was useful for them to select an entry point to search. However, confounded by many other factors, it is not clear whether this behavior would be beneficial to the overall task.</p><p>Comparing the searchers' performance of the baseline interface with that of the corresponding automatic system, they found a significant improvement in terms of relevance, depth and precision. That indicates that engagement of searcher's effort has a positive effect on the system performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.2">Rutgers</head><p>The Rutgers group investigated the role that the layout of search results plays in supporting human searchers executing topic distillation tasks. Success was measured in terms of accuracy and precision, operationalized as coverage and overlap, so the searcher was expected to find documents that provide information on as many distinct aspects of the assigned topic as possible, with as little overlap between them as possible. Their hypothesis was that using the structure of the domain and of the document corpus in order to organize the search output, would help identify aspects of the search topic in different sub-domains of the document collection, would reduce the searchers' cognitive load and would produce better results than the classic hit list. They tested this hypothesis by using two user interfaces for the Panoptic search engine, one with a simple list output, and the second with documents clustered based on common URL elements.</p><p>Their initial analysis shows that although it does not produce better coverage than the linear interface, the hierarchical interface seems to be conducive to less effort for the searcher: fewer iterations, shorter search sessions, fewer documents seen, selected and viewed. With regards to subjective measures, users perceived the hierarchical one as easier to use and better at supporting the topic distillation task. These results were not statistically significant. What was significant is that the subjects perceived the two systems equally easy to learn and that they preferred the hierarchical display.</p><p>One advantage of the structured output, as suggested by the objective measures and highlighted by the users' comments, is the support for investigating different sub-domains of a document collection and consequently different aspects of a topic. The searcher does not need to make a cognitive effort to separate the search results into sub-domain, so the layout makes the interaction easier and more pleasant and more accurately supports the searcher's judgment on task completion.</p><p>Appendix A: All non-interactive runs  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,158.24,692.37,281.06,8.74"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: Breakdown of home page vs named page performance.</figDesc></figure>
