<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As a part of the TREC-2003 evaluation campaign, the UniNE group is taking part in the genomics and Web tracks. The first section of this paper describes the IR models we used in the genomics information retrieval. Section 2 describes our various approaches to automatically extracting gene descriptions from a given scientific paper, using only its title and its abstract. Section 3 describes our procedures for indexing and retrieving Web pages, based on three document representations, and our distributed indexing framework based on the Okapi probabilistic model. Section 4 explains the IR approach we used to combine both Web page content and anchor information when searching for specific named pages and homepages. Finally, Section 5 describes how our IR scheme can be used within the context of topic distillation tasks.</p><p>In order to evaluate our hypothesis, we used the SMART system as a testbed, implementing various vector-space IR schemes and probabilistic models. This year our experiments were conducted on an Intel Pentium III/600 (memory: 1 GB, swap: 2 GB, disk: 6 x 35 GB) and all experiments were fully automated.</p><p>The indexing procedure we used in both genomic tracks is described in Section 1.1, while Section 1.2 provides an overall description of various IR models. Section 1.3 describes the pseudo-relevance feedback (or blind query expansion) used in our experiments. Section 1.4 shows how we combine the various result lists generated, using different indexing and searching schemes in order to process the same document collection (data fusion). The last section evaluates the retrieval effectiveness achieved by diverse IR models and also that of various combined approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Indexing Procedure</head><p>We chose the SMART system as effective means of searching the Medline collection subset. From the original documents and during the indexing process, we retained only the following logical sections: TI (title), TT (transliterated title from non-Roman alphabet language), AB (abstract), MH (MeSH terms based on the NLM's controlled vocabulary), GS (Gene symbol or abbreviated gene names), and RN (EC/RN numbers are assigned by the Enzyme Commission to designate a particular enzyme).</p><p>Only the available descriptions were used to formulate the queries. The "official symbol" field was repeated three times however in order to assign more importance to this particular field.</p><p>To form an indexing word, our system takes letter and digit sequences into account, or when preceded and followed by a letter, the following character is used: '.@!_ (the default SMART system list). Thus the strings "IBM360", "U.S", or "sym_name" are viewed as single indexing terms. To this set, we might add / and -characters (a set labeled as "Separator+") in order to view the sequence "DEAD/H" as one indexing term.</p><p>Moreover, a stemming procedure was often used in order to reduce to the same root (or stem) inflectional and derivational variants of words. For example, the words "thinking", "thinkers" or "thinks" would be reduced to the stem "think". To achieve this, we employed the Lovins' stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.90,700.09,59.86,11.07" target="#b11">(Lovins, 1968)</ref> based on a list of over 260 suffixes (the default stemming approach in SMART). On the other hand, we sometimes preferred using a light stemming approach, wherein only the plural form of English words were removed. To evaluate this stemming approach, we adopted the "S stemmer" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.00,118.09,64.39,11.07" target="#b7">(Harman, 1991)</ref> based on the following rules:</p><p>1. If a word ends in «-ies», but not «-eies» or «-aies» then replace «-ies» by «-y»; 2. If a word ends in «-es», but not «-aes», «-ees» or «-oes» then replace «-es» by «-e»; 3. If a word ends in «-s», but not «-us» or «-ss» then remove the «-s».</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Search Models</head><p>In order to define a retrieval model, we must specify how the documents and the requests are to be represented (indexing procedure) and how the similarity between document and query surrogates are to be computed. To achieve this and in order to obtain a broader view of the relative merit of various retrieval models, we evaluated the genomic corpus using 11 search models.</p><p>As a first approach, we adopted a binary indexing scheme within which each document (or request) was represented by a set of keywords, without any weight. To measure similarity between documents and requests, we counted the number of common terms, computed according to the inner product (retrieval model denoted "doc=bnn, query=bnn" or "bnn-bnn"). For document and query indexing however binary logical restrictions are often too limiting. In order to weight the presence of each indexing term in a document surrogate (or in a query), we sometimes took account of the term occurrence frequency, thus allowing for better term distinction and increasing indexing flexibility (model denoted "doc=nnn, query=nnn" or "nnn-nnn").</p><p>Those terms however that did occur very frequently in the collection were very helpful in distinguishing between relevant and non-relevant items. Thus we could count their frequency in the collection, or more precisely the inverse document frequency (denoted by idf j ), resulting in more weight for sparse words and less weight for more frequent ones. This idf value is usually computed as ln(n/df j ) where n indicates the number of documents in the collection. Moreover, a cosine normalization could prove beneficial and each indexing weight could vary within the range of 0 to 1 (retrieval model notation: "ntc-ntc"). Table <ref type="table" coords="2,212.00,644.50,4.95,10.00">A</ref>.1 in the Appendix depicts the exact weighting formulation.</p><p>Other variants were also created, especially when considering the occurrence of a given term in a document as a rare event. Thus, it could be good practice to assign more importance to the first occurrence of this word as compared to any successive or repeating occurrences. Therefore, the tf component could be computed as 0.5 + 0.5 • [tf / max tf in a document] (retrieval model denoted "doc=atn"). Moreover, we should consider that a term's presence in a shorter document provides stronger evidence than it does in a longer document. To account for this, we integrated document length within the weighting formula, leading to more complex IR models; for example, the IR model denoted by "doc=Lnu" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,514.21,167.50,36.80,10.00;2,325.00,179.50,46.77,10.00" target="#b3">(Buckley et al., 1996)</ref>, "doc=dtu" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.37,179.50,83.33,10.00" target="#b20">(Singhal et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to previous models based on the vectorspace approach, we also considered probabilistic models, an example being the Okapi probabilistic model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,325.00,231.50,103.21,10.00" target="#b14">(Robertson et al., 2000)</ref>. As a second probabilistic approach, we implemented the Prosit (PRObabilistic Sift of Information Terms) approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.66,254.09,61.34,11.07;2,325.00,266.09,75.70,11.07" target="#b0">(Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,405.32,266.09,80.55,11.07" target="#b1">Amati et al., 2003)</ref>, based on the following indexing formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,333.00,294.98,189.01,61.32">w ij = Inf 1 ij • Inf 2 ij = (1 -Prob 1 ij ) • Inf 2 ij with Prob 1 ij = tfn ij / (tfn ij + 1) tfn ij = tf ij • log 2 [1 + ((C • mean dl) / l j )] Inf 2 ij = -log 2 [1 / (1+l j )] -tfn ij • log 2 [l j / (1+l j )]</formula><p>with l j = tc j / n in which w ij reflects the importance of each single-term tj in a document Di, tfj the frequency of occurrence of term tj in a document Di, tc j indicates the number of occurrences of term tj in the collection, n the number of documents, and C and mean dl are constants. In this model, the query terms are weighted according to a term occurrence frequency (denoted "nnn").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Pseudo-Relevance Feedback</head><p>It was observed that pseudo-relevance feedback (or blind-query expansion) seemed to be a useful technique for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. In our evaluations, we adopted Rocchio's approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.00,528.50,70.67,10.00" target="#b15">(Rocchio, 1971)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,325.00,540.50,94.39,10.00" target="#b3">(Buckley et al., 1996)</ref> in which the newly expanded query Q' was composed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,333.00,569.75,115.95,75.24">Q' = a . Q + b . † 1 r ⋅ w ij j=1 r Â</formula><p>within which Q denoted the previous request, a= 0.75, b = 0.75 and the system was allowed to add s terms extracted from the original query's r best ranked documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Data Fusion</head><p>Until now, we used a single search model (or engine) when searching document collections. We might however suggest sending the request to various Of course we might also employ the round-robin merging strategy, taking the first retrieved item from the first result list, then the first retrieved document from the second list, etc., and finally the first item from the last result list and then back again to the first result list. Duplicates encountered in this process are simply ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Evaluation</head><p>To evaluate various IR models using the genomic collection, we used 50 queries and various statistics on relevance assessments. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,524.70,266.09,3.89,11.07" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the number of pertinent items per request is relatively small (mean = 11.32). The mean average precision for nine vector-space schemes together with the Okapi and Prosit probabilistic models are depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,543.49,314.09,3.76,11.07">3</ref> An examination of Table <ref type="table" coords="3,451.63,464.09,5.00,11.07">3</ref> shows that the best retrieval effectiveness was obtained when using the vector-space model "dtu-dtn," while second best results were usually obtained using the "atn-ntc" scheme. Ranking third was the "Lnu-ltc" model (using the S stemmer), or the "ltn-ntc" model (using <ref type="bibr" coords="3,520.00,524.09,31.02,11.07;3,325.00,536.09,36.96,11.07">Lovins' stemmer)</ref>. In these experiments, the simple "tf-idf" approach (denoted "ntc-ntc") did not appear to perform very well. To our surprise, we noted that the Okapi or Prosit probabilistic model did not perform very well in this task, contrarily to our previous experiments (for example those based on the Amaryllis corpus, also composed of bibliographic records <ref type="bibr" coords="3,466.62,608.09,54.16,11.07" target="#b19">(Savoy, 2003)</ref>).</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" coords="3,387.94,624.09,5.00,11.07">3</ref> we might also infer that the extended word delimiter (labeled "Separator+") usually enhanced performance only slightly. Moreover, the light S stemmer resulted in better retrieval effectiveness than did Lovins' algorithm. From the data depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,218.68,495.09,3.76,11.07" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, we can conclude that pseudo-relevance feedback usually increases mean average precision. When taking the r=10 best ranked documents into account, performance is usually enhanced compared to r=3 or r=5. This improvement is however rather small, particularly for the "dtu-dtn" vector-space model. On the other hand from previous experiments with the Prosit model, there is evidence that blind query expansion usually improves mean average precision significantly <ref type="bibr" coords="4,209.00,603.09,61.75,11.07" target="#b19">(Savoy, 2003)</ref>. Our current test-collection seems to confirm this. Finally, we evaluated various data fusion strategies that might be employed to improve retrieval effectiveness. In our case we submitted the same request to two search engines (Prosit and "dtu-dtn") with and without blind query expansion (using the best parameter setting). Based on the data shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,210.35,687.09,3.76,11.07" target="#tab_3">5</ref>, it appears that data fusion based on combRSVn or a simple round-robin scheme performs better. Moreover, various data fusion strategies <ref type="bibr" coords="4,373.50,503.09,177.50,11.07;4,325.00,515.09,42.88,11.07">(combMIN, combMAX, combANZ, and combNBZ)</ref>   <ref type="table" coords="4,364.39,685.09,5.00,11.07" target="#tab_4">6</ref> shows the results of combining the Prosit and "dtu-dtn" search models, using both stemmers (denoted "Lov" or "S") and separator characters lists (our separator list "Separator+" is denoted "+"). From this data, we can conclude that it seemed better to combine retrieval schemes based on a variety of indexing strategies (e.g., using the different separator lists shown in the second column, or different stemming algorithms as depicted in the third and forth columns). Finally, Table <ref type="table" coords="5,178.56,130.09,5.00,11.07" target="#tab_5">7</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Genomic Information Extraction</head><p>The main purpose of the genomic secondary task was to address the bioinformatic community's information extraction needs. More precisely, the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF (Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database), either from a Medline record or from the entire article. GeneRIF snippets sometimes contain direct quotations from article abstracts but they might also include or paraphrase certain texts extracted from article titles or abstracts.</p><p>The data used for this task consisted of 139 GeneRIFs, representing all articles appearing in five journals (Journal of Biological Chemistry, Journal of Cell Biology, Science, Nucleic Acids Research and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), during the latter half of 2002.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Models</head><p>From the beginning, we decided to use only the article titles and abstracts for this task. As the title was supposed to be a good candidate for the GeneRIF annotation, we tried selecting it systematically and using it as a baseline performance measure for our task.</p><p>Then for each GeneRIF we tried selecting each GeneRIF term also contained in the corresponding abstract. This method provided us with a theoretical maximum that could be reached, using only articles titles and abstracts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Dummy (UniNEie5)</head><p>First of all, we established the term frequencies for the words contained in the GeneRIFs. Then, we ranked 1 Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/ them and selected in descending order, those terms having frequencies greater or equal to 9. The words selected by using this simple strategy were:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>cell role protein expression gene receptor activation regulate human apoptosis alpha sp1 signaling domain regulation kinase suggest pathway</head><p>We then supplied this fixed sequence of words as the GeneRIF for each query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Random (UniNEie4)</head><p>For each query, we segmented the corresponding abstract into sentences. Then we considered all sentences, including the title. Each sentence having 10 to 14 words was repeated once into our set of candidates. Each sentence within this set thus had an equal probability of being selected. Finally we randomly chose a sentence that was returned as the GeneRIF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Logarithm of Term Frequency (UniNEie3)</head><p>As the GeneRIFs were provided, we computed the term frequencies for all words contained therein. Then, for each query, we segmented the corresponding abstract into sentences. For each sentence, including the title, we removed the stopwords and then stemmed the remaining words, using the SMART stopword list (571 entries) and the S stemmer (see Section 1.1). We then computed a sentence score as follows: † score = ln(tf j ) j=1 len Â len where j is the term index, tfj the term frequency in GeneRIFs and len the length of the sentence without stopwords. Finally, we returned the sentence having the highest score as the GeneRIF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Term Frequency and Logistic Regression</head><p>We again used the above process except that the score was computed as follows: † score = w(tf j ) j=1 len Â len where j is the term index, tfj the term frequency in GeneRIFs, and len is the length of the sentence without stopwords. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,397.17,632.09,5.00,11.07">8</ref> lists the resultant w(tfj) values.</p><p>We then selected the sentence having the highest score as a GeneRIF candidate and applied a logistic regression model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,398.58,672.09,121.82,11.07" target="#b8">(Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000)</ref>, using the statistical Fisher method to predict when the system should return the chosen sentence or the title.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Candidate</head><p>This action was not induced by oxidizing agents in either receptor. For each candidate, we could compute certain statistics, such as its length ("Len"), the number of acronyms ("Abrv"), the number of indexing terms ("Terms"), etc. as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,146.66,626.09,8.35,11.07" target="#tab_7">11</ref>. Since however we knew the title can usually be viewed as a suitable GeneRIF, we also computed certain statistics concerning the difference between a given candidate and the article title, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,107.06,674.09,8.36,11.07" target="#tab_8">12</ref>. These values were then used as predictors in our logistic regression model to compute the probability that the corresponding candidate would be a suitable GeneRIF. The last column in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,265.97,710.09,10.04,11.07" target="#tab_8">12</ref> lists the estimated value of these corresponding statistics. For example, the estimate for the variable "d.Len" is negative, indicating that when the candidate length is greater than the title length, this fact decreases the probability that this candidate would be a suitable GeneRIF. Using the result of the logistic regression, we returned the complete title 126 times and the candidate 13 times, 7 of them forming a part of the title.</p></div>

The second row forms our baseline, representing the article title, a scheme within which the title is always returned. On the other hand, the third row ("Generifs « abst.") represents the maximum value that could be achieved when selecting the most appropriate sentence, using only the article title and abstract. Using this data, we hoped to improve our extraction of the suitable GeneRIFs from the title scheme, through using one of our logistic regression models. In this case, it seemed that Model B (or UniNEie1) performed slightly better, even though both models returned the title many times. We attempted to improve our system's performance through incorporating additional data, such as full text articles or gene names, together with the selection of the explanatory variable set for the logistic regression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Our Okapi Search Model</head><p>Based on our previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="7,219.00,681.09,78.07,11.07;7,71.00,693.09,23.57,11.07" target="#b16">(Savoy &amp; Picard, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,99.42,693.09,114.19,11.07">(Savoy &amp; Rasolofo, 2003)</ref>, the Okapi search model provided significantly greater retrieval effectiveness. However, in order to manage the Web collection (1,247,753 documents that were extracted from the .GOV domain, or about 18.1 GB of data), we needed to modify this search model for two reasons. Firstly, we wanted to incorporate three document representatives for each Web page, and secondly we needed to distribute the inverted file in order to respect the 2 GB limit.</p><p>When processing three document representations, we estimated the degree of similarity between document Di and the current query would be a linear combination of the inner product of the three document representations, to be given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="7,301.73,222.00,247.29,106.99">† RSV(D i ) = a ⋅ w ij (1) ⋅ qw j j=1 m Â + b ⋅ w ij (2) ⋅ qw j j=1 m Â + g ⋅ w ij (3) ⋅ qw j j=1 m Â (1)</formula><p>where w</p><p>(1) ij indicates the weight attached to the term tj in the document Di in the first document representation (w</p><p>(2) ij and w</p><p>(3) ij for the second, respectively, the third document surrogate), and the parameters a, b, g are used to assign a comparative importance to each document representative.</p><p>Creating a single inverted file from a collection of approximately 18 GB might be impossible using a 32bit system (e.g., Linux). To overcome this limit, we will follow the approach described in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,500.00,403.09,50.78,11.07;7,325.00,415.09,54.59,11.07">Rasolofo &amp; Savoy (2003)</ref>, whereby each sub-collection would be indexed using the tf component. When merging the result lists obtained from searching into these different sub-collections, we computed the idf component and applied the normalization. Following this step, we could then merge the result lists according to the new document scores.</p><p>Knowing that both Web tasks required high precision searches, we decided to enhance our Okapi model by implementing the term proximity scoring function (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,388.43,539.09,117.45,11.07">Rasolofo &amp; Savoy (2003)</ref> for more details). The main premise was that if all search keywords appear in a document representative, our search model would increase the corresponding document score. On the other hand, if only a part of these search terms appeared in a given Web page, the final retrieval status value would remain unchanged (see Eq. 1). While the term proximity function would have a greater value if the search keywords appear close to each other, they may occur more than once within a given sentence or tag. In our system the constant d denoted the impact of these proximity scores. Of course, setting d = 0 means that the proximity score is not computed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Named and Home Pages Finding</head><p>The following considerations formed the basis of our first Web task. When submitting a request to a search engine, users will sometimes not want a ranked list of Web pages concerning a particular topic, but rather they would prefer the location of an underlying service or known-item (usually presented within a short list of the most probable locations). For example, the appropriate response to a query on "state department", "Secret Service jobs", "Navajo Nation", or "barbara mikulski bio" (and even with a spelling error such as "US Volcano Oservatories") would not be a ranked list of documents covering these subjects but rather those site(s) that contain the required form/information/list. To accomplish this we needed to implement an IR system that could retrieve a limited number of pages (one at the very least) in response to the user's request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Search Models</head><p>As a basis for our search model we used the Okapi model as described in Section 3. Our first document representative was based on information found in the Web page, including the corresponding &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;META&gt; tags ("keywords" and "description"). Of course Web pages might also contain links and their associated anchor texts (or anchor texts for outgoing links). Our second document surrogate was based on the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag and the anchor texts for those Web pages pointing to the current document. The third document representative was built by concatenating the &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;H1&gt;, and &lt;BIG&gt; tags from pages pointing to the current Web page. This third aspect was used to reinforce the importance of those Web pages pointing to the current page. Since we know that end tags (e.g., &lt;/H1&gt; or &lt;/BIG&gt;) are sometimes missing, we only considered the first 64 words following any given tag. This indexing strategy was based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="8,106.17,531.09,99.00,11.07" target="#b4">(Craswell et al., 2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,215.00,531.09,81.76,11.07;8,71.00,543.09,21.90,11.07" target="#b21">(Westerveld et al., 2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,100.81,543.09,81.30,11.07" target="#b10">(Kraaij et al., 2002)</ref>, showing that anchor texts from other Web pages pointing to the current page may provide compact and often accurate descriptions of the current page's content. For this reason, we extracted link anchor texts from all Web pages pointing to the current page and concatenated them to form our second document representative. Finally, we also considered URL content (or more precisely, the similarity between the URL text and the current request, or URL lengths). In our current search models, these additional sources of information had not taken into account.</p><p>When high precision results are required for indexing documents or requests, it is usually not a good idea to include a stemming procedure. We could however adopt a light stemming such as the "Sstemmer" (see Section 1.1 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,439.03,70.09,63.82,11.07" target="#b7">(Harman, 1991)</ref>). In this case, the words "house" and "houses" would be reduced to the same root while the term "housing" would be treated as a different indexing unit. Based on our experiments from last year <ref type="bibr" coords="8,439.14,118.09,107.51,11.07">(Savoy &amp; Rasolofo, 2003)</ref>, we decided to ignore the stemming approach for this task due to the fact that even light stemming was usually found to diminish the system's overall performance <ref type="bibr" coords="8,378.04,166.09,103.75,11.07">(Savoy &amp; Rasolofo, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Evaluation</head><p>In this IR search model, based on three document representatives and a proximity scoring function, we first needed to determine the relative importance assigned to each document representative (based on internal Web page content for the first surrogate), as compared to the weight attached to the second and third document representatives (based mainly on link anchor texts from those Web pages pointing to the current one). The relative importance for each surrogate was controlled through using the parameters a, b, g (see Section 3) while the proximity score was weighted using the constant d. Our evaluation was based mainly on the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the first correct answer found by the system. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,400.40,503.09,10.01,11.07" target="#tab_12">15</ref> depicts statistics on the relevance assessments of this test-collection, clearly showing that we usually obtain one correct answer per topic. For each of the 300 queries, we considered only the first 100 retrieved items. As seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,499.77,551.09,8.46,11.07" target="#tab_13">16</ref>, the best value for our parameters seems to be around a=0.6, b=0.4, g=0.05, and d=0.1, thus assigning a little more weight to internal representation (parameter a) than to the anchor texts of all Web pages pointing to the current document (parameter b ). The third representation does not seem to have a great impact on system's performance. The underlined parameters in this table represent the settings used for our official runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number</head><p>Finally, Table <ref type="table" coords="8,401.10,675.09,10.13,11.07" target="#tab_14">17</ref> provides a summary description of our four official runs. Usually, we did not attach much importance (g = 0 or very small) to the third document representative (&lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;H1&gt;, and &lt;BIG&gt; texts from pages pointing to the current Web page). The difference between UniNEnp1 and UniNEnp3 represented the inclusion of the term proximity scoring function within UniNEnp3, seemingly a useful technique for improving retrieval effectiveness. Taking account for this third surrogate enhanced the system's performance (see Table <ref type="table" coords="9,186.75,142.09,8.34,11.07" target="#tab_13">16</ref>).</p><p>The performance differences between UniNEnp2, UniNEnp5 were due to the various parameter settings used for the Okapi model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Topic Distillation</head><p>The basic purpose of the topic distillation task was to return a list of key resources on a given topic (e.g., "pest control safety", "computer viruses" or "children's literature"). Explicitly defining what does or does not constitute a suitable resource was however difficult, and each definition seemed to become more and more ambiguous. While Web pages with appropriate content might be considered as useful key resources and we could have retrieved them using a classic IR model, key resources may also be good hubs (or Web pages pointing to various pages containing pertinent content with respect to the submitted request). Moreover, if a Web page is linked to two, three or more children having a high degree of similarity with the request, it seems more appropriate to return this parent page rather than the two, three of more children. More generally however returning many pages extracted from the same Web site would not be viewed as a wise strategy. Thus to suggest a proper solution for this specific task, we decided to employ various strategies that would point to reliable browsing starting points rather than simply retrieving Web pages with suitable content. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Search Models</head><p>As for the named page and homepage search task, we built three document representatives for each Web page contained in the .GOV collection. The first representative accounted for Web page content along with its &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;META&gt; tags ("keywords" and "description") and the anchor texts contained in the page. The second document surrogate was built from the text delimited by the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag together with link anchor texts from all outgoing and all incoming links. The third document representative was composed of all &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;H1&gt; tags provided by all pointed pages (or pages accessible within a one-click distance from the current page).</p><p>Once the pages were retrieved, we followed hyperlinks coming into them in order to define proper starting points for browsing (in this case we followed existing hyperlinks in the reverse direction). To retrieve these starting points we used our spreading activation (SA) search scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="9,453.04,665.09,93.62,11.07" target="#b5">(Crestani &amp; Lee, 2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="9,325.00,677.09,95.34,11.07" target="#b16">(Savoy &amp; Picard, 2001)</ref>. Using this method, document scores initially computed by the IR system (denoted RSV(D i )) were propagated to the linked documents through a certain number of cycles, based on a propagation factor. We used a simplified version with only one cycle and a fixed propagation factor l for all links. As a result, the final retrieval status value for a document D i linked to k documents was computed using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="10,84.00,133.87,211.02,28.86">RSV'(D i ) = RSV(D i ) + l • RSV(D j ) j=1 k Â<label>(3)</label></formula><p>When in our experiments we tried to extract the proper starting sites for browsing, we only considered all incoming links for each of the k best-ranked documents.</p><p>As other possibilities, we might consider the Page-Rank algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="10,139.44,234.09,84.60,11.07" target="#b2">(Brin &amp; Page, 1998)</ref>, the HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="10,96.30,246.09,73.50,11.07" target="#b9">(Kleinberg, 1998)</ref> or probabilistic argumentation systems <ref type="bibr" coords="10,112.35,258.09,64.65,11.07" target="#b12">(Picard, 1998)</ref>. During the evaluation campaign of last year however, we did obtain poor performance when employing the HITS algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="10,269.00,282.09,28.02,11.07;10,71.00,294.09,74.66,11.07">(Savoy &amp; Rasolofo, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Evaluation</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of a topic distillation IR scheme, we could use the precision achieved after retrieving 5 or 10 documents (under the labels "Prec@5" or "Prec@10") together with the number of relevant items retrieved (out of a total of 516 for the 50 queries included in the .GOV collection). Each request would be composed of a short title and a descriptive part. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,363.62,62.09,10.02,11.07" target="#tab_15">18</ref> shows various statistics based on relevance assessments. The mean number of relevant items (or key resources) per request is 10.32. From considering the number of distinct roots (e.g., the first part of an URL, e.g., "trec.nist.gov"), we found that in mean, there were 8.38 different roots per query (for Query# 13, the unique relevant item is coming from the Web site "nimh.nih.gov"). On the other hand, for Query# 48, we found 9 relevant pages (over a total of 10) extracted from the root page "prime.jsc.nasa.gov".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number</head><p>In our first set of experiments, we evaluated our extended Okapi IR model (see Section 3). By varying the value attached to the parameters a , b , g , we assigned more or less weight to each document representation. For example, when we set a to 0, and b to 0, we accounted for text delimited by the &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;H1&gt; tags provided by all pointed pages. In other words, we viewed the page as a good starting point for browsing (limited however to a one-click distance). On the other hand, with a = 1, b = 0, and g = 0, our search model was based only on Web page content.</p></div>

From data depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,501.08,82.09,8.44,11.07">21</ref>, it seems that the propagation factor l must be around 0.02, and the SA must be limited to the first k = 300 or first k = 400 best-ranked items.</p><p>When using the best-run shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,522.77,134.09,8.46,11.07">19</ref>, we tried various parameter settings as depicted in top part of Table <ref type="table" coords="11,361.39,158.09,8.35,11.07">21</ref>. In this case, we may enhance the precision after 10 documents from 11.8% to 14.0% (leading to +20% improvement). On the other hand, when the starting point is based only on the Web page content (as depicted in the bottom part of Table <ref type="table" coords="11,488.67,206.09,8.37,11.07">21</ref>, with a= 1, b = 0, g = 0, d = 0), our SA may also improve the precision at 10 retrieved item from 6.2% to 10.2% (+64% improvement).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix 1. Weighting schemes</head><p>To assign an indexing weight w ij reflecting the importance of each single-term tj in a document Di, the formula shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,439.10,185.09,5.08,11.07">A</ref>.1 may be used, where document length (the number of indexing terms) for document Di is denoted by nt i , and n indicates the number of documents in the collection. For the Okapi weighting scheme, K represents the ratio between the length of document Di measured by l i (sum of tf ij ) and the collection's mean is noted by avdl or more precisely</p><p>For the Genomic corpus, the constant avdl was fixed at 300, b at 0.55, k 1 at 1.2, C at 3, mean dl at 73, pivot at 50 and slope at 0.05. For both Web searching tasks, we set avdl at 900, b at 0.75, k 1 at 1.2, pivot at 125 and the constant slope at 0.1. bnn w ij = 1 nnn w ij = tf ij ltn w ij = (ln(tf ij ) + 1) . idf j atn w ij = idf j .
