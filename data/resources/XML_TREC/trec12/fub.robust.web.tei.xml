<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our participation in TREC 2003 aims to adapt the use of the DFR (Divergence From Randomness) models with Query Expansion (QE) to the robust track and the topic distillation task of the Web track. We focus on the robust track, where the utilization of QE improves the global performance but hurts the performance on the worst topics. In particular, we study the problem of the selective application of the query expansion. We define two information theory based functions, Info DFR and InfoQ, predicting respectively the AP (Average Precision) of queries and the AP increment of queries after the application of QE. InfoQ is used to selectively apply QE. We show that the use of InfoQ achieves the same performance comparable of the unexpanded method on the set of the worst topics, but a better performance than full QE on the entire set of topics.</p></div>

Although this year the description-only queries are quite long, the automatic application of QE to all queries seemed to be the safest way to achieve a higher value of MAP. However, QE is detrimental to both MAP(X) and to NrTopicsNoRel measures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">How QE affects the Robust track</head><p>Consider as an example the performance of the run fub03InOLe3 in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,397.23,291.00,3.88,8.97" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; fub03InOLe3 uses the model I(n)OL2 (see Formula 1). With full QE, we achieved an increase of MAP equal to +7.5% with respect to the baseline run. If we had an oracle telling us when to apply QE query-by-query, the performance increase would nearly double passing from +7.5% to +13.3%. However, without the oracle a wrong decision of omitting the QE mechanism would seriously hurt the final MAP of the run. The average gain per query is ∼0.063 and the gain is much greater than the average loss (∼0.039). Moreover, the number of cases with a successful application of QE (57 out 100) is larger than the number of the failure cases. Both odds are thus in favour of the application of QE.</p><p>In the robust track, the success rate of the QE application was below our expectation. Comparing the figueres of Table <ref type="table" coords="4,240.68,422.50,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_1">2</ref> with those relative to all the 150 queries of the past TREC data, we have observed a detriment of the success rate. The success rate was around 65% with all the 150 old queries of past TREC data. A detriment in precision at 10 was observed for only 15% of all the 150 old queries (against 19% of the TREC 2003 queries).</p><p>In addition, the increase of MAP with QE using all the old 150 queries was larger (∼ +10%) than that obtained with the new queries (∼ +5%).</p><p>In the next section we propose the measure InfoQ to predict successful application of QE. InfoQ is indeed correlated to the increment of Average Precision after QE activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Predicting the successful application of QE with InfoQ</head><p>Let Q be a sample of queries q and let</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="4,169.54,572.14,218.62,26.51">InfoPriorQ(q) = term∈q -log 2 Freq(term|Collection) TotFreq(Collection)</formula><p>InfoPriorQ has a moderately weak negative correlation with QE, that is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="4,132.22,629.25,149.71,9.81">ρ(AP QE -AP, InfoPriorQ) = -0.27</formula><p>where AP QE is the average precision after the application of QE, and AP denotes the average precision of the system without QE. InfoPriorQ is also linearly related to the length of the query (ρ(QueryLength, InfoPriorQ) = 0.90. Query length is thus a different indicator of the successful application of the QE. A short query in general requires QE, but QE can be easily harmful for long queries, but using only the query length as an indicator QE varies its behaviour for moderately long queries.</p><p>We now introduce InfoQ to deal with the selective application of QE. InfoQ combines InfoPriorQ and the divergence-based function Info DFR which we have already encountered in Section 1.3. Info DFR query rankings may not agree using different DFR models. A way to compare different score functions over the same set Q of queries is to normalize using their standard normal scores.</p><p>Let</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="5,132.22,478.36,287.37,23.84">M q = max InfoPriorQ(q) -µ InfoPriorQ σ InfoPriorQ , max M ∈DFR arg Info M (q) -µ Info M σ Info M</formula><p>The function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="5,160.58,531.20,300.84,23.39">InfoQ = 1 QueryLength InfoPriorQ -µ InfoPriorQ σ InfoPriorQ + M q (5)</formula><p>where the µ X s and the σ X s stand for the mean and the standard deviation of the X values over the sample Q of queries q.</p><p>Because the correlation factor between AP increment and InfoQ is negative, we need to trigger the QE when InfoQ is below a given threshold:</p><p>Apply QE to query q ⇔ def InfoQ(q) &lt; threshold (</p><p>A cautious way to smooth different Info DFR values is to compare the threshold to the maximum value among all these DFR models, InfoPriorQ included. This explain why we first compute the maximum value among the normal standard scores of InfoPriorQ and all Info M (q) where M is a DRF model. The standard normal query-scores of Info DFR may not agree, even in sign, using different DFR models. Since the correlation factor is negative, and since we trigger the QE when InfoQ is below a given threshold, then a cautious way to smooth different Info DFR values is to compare the threshold to the maximum value of all these DFR standard normal scores, InfoPriorQ included.</p><p>InfoQ has a higher correlation than InfoPriorQ (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,357.82,372.28,4.15,8.97">3</ref>) with QE ρ(AP QE -AP, InfoQ) = -0.33 and a smaller correlation factor with the query length<ref type="foot" coords="6,316.78,414.54,3.49,6.28" target="#foot_2">2</ref> ρ(AP QE -AP, InfoQ) = 0.62</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.7">Predicting topic difficulty with Info DFR</head><p>It is a well known evidence that the QE effectiveness is strictly related to the number of documents which are relevant for a given query in the set of the topmost documents in the ranking. If the early precision of the first-pass retrieval is high, then we have a good chance to extract good additional topic terms together with their relative query-weights.</p><p>To start our investigation we have first computed the correlation factor beween -the number Rel of relevant documents in the whole collection and the AP value over the 100 queries, and -between Rel and the precision at 10( P@10).</p><p>The correlation value -1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 indicates the degree of the linear dependence between the two pair of measurements. When ρ = 0 the correlation coefficient indicates that the two variables are independent. When instead there is a linear correlation, the correlation coefficient is either -1 or 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,238.21,399.95,10.58,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A negative correlation factor indicates that the two variables are inversely related. Surprisingly, both these correlation factors come out to be negative (ρ(Rel, AP) = -0.36 and ρ(Rel, P@10) = -0.14).</p><p>Although in these two cases the absolute values of the correlation coefficient are not close to -1, even small values of the correlation factor are regarded very meaningful especially in large samples <ref type="bibr" coords="7,214.33,471.68,15.27,8.97" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, these values of the correlation factors seem to demonstrate that the greater the number Rel of relevant documents, the less the precision (MAP and P@10). An approximation line of the scatter line of the AP values for different numbers of relevant documents is produced in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,239.96,519.50,3.74,8.97" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The fact that the correlation factor with AP is larger than that with P@10 is due to the definition of AP. The AP measure combines recall and precision by using the number Rel of relevant documents.</p><p>This negative correlation might appear to be counter-intuitive, since among the easiest topics there are many which possess a small number of relevant documents, and, as opposite, many difficult topics have many relevant documents. On the other hand, a possible explanation of these negative correlation factors is that a small number of relevant documents for a topic witnesses the fact that the topic is "specific" or "non-general" with respect to the content of the collection. In such a situation, common-sense says that specific queries have few relevant documents, their query-terms have few occurrences in the collection, and they thus are the easiest ones. However, a definition of the specificity based on the number of relevant documents for the query would depend on the evaluation; we rather prefer to have a different but operational definition of the query-specificity or query-difficulty.</p><p>The notion of query-difficulty is given by the notion of the amount of information Info DFR gained after a first-pass ranking. If there is a significant divergence in the queryterm frequencies before and after the retrieval, then we make the hypothesis that this divergence is caused by a query which is easy-defined. difficulty score of q = def Info DFR (q) of Formula 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,449.80,495.85,11.62,8.97" target="#b6">(7)</ref> where DFR is a basic model (based on the Binomial, the Bose-Einstein statistics or the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure). We here use the probability of Bose-Einstein as defined in Formula (4). Note that the same weight was used by our expansion method in 3 runs out of the 4 expanded ones (fub03InB2e3, fub03InOLe3, fub03IneOLe3). The Kullback-Leibler divergence was adopted in the run fub03IeOLKe3 (see Table <ref type="table" coords="8,420.12,565.59,3.60,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>There are other information theoretic measures capturing the notion of term-specificity of the query. One possible choice, based on the language model, is the clarity score <ref type="bibr" coords="8,445.80,589.50,11.71,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, but it is more difficult to implement. There is an interesting study <ref type="bibr" coords="8,372.19,601.45,11.62,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which found using the Pearson coefficient that there is no correlation between the average precision with the original query and s average precision increment by QE. Billerbeck and Zobel explored a range of query metrics to predict the QE success, but, as they report, without clear success. They assert to have included into this family the similarity score of the documents fetched in the original ranking; a measure of how distinct these documents were from the rest of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,109.14,139.74,4.24,9.82">3</ref>: The information content InfoQ of the query based on the combination of the priors and Info DFR within the topmost retrieved documents is negatively correlated to the AP increase with the QE (ρ(AP increase rate with QE, InfoQ) = -0.33). The first and the third quadrants contain the errors when the threshold is set to 0.</p><p>the collection; specificity of the query terms; and an approximation to query clarity.</p><p>The goodness of Info DFR is tested with the linear correlation factor with AP of the unexpanded queries. The motivation is that easy queries usually yield high AP values. To compute the difficulty score of the query we first produced a first-pass ranking as it is done in QE. We took the set TopDocuments of the first 10 retrieved documents and we computed a score for each term occurring in the query. We considered the queryterms which appear at least twice in these pseudo-relevant documents. This score reflects the amount of information carried by the query-term within these pseudo-relevant documents. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,221.49,527.21,3.74,8.97" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Info DFR has a significant correlation with the AP of the unexpanded queries ρ(Info Bo2 , AP) = 0.52. Similarly to the negative correlation between the number of relevant documents and the AP of the unexpanded queries, which is ρ(Rel, AP) = -0.36, the correlation factor between the score InfoQ and Rel was negative ( ρ(Rel, Info Bo2 ) = -0.23). Again, this may be explained by the fact that specific queries possess fewer relevant documents.</p><p>We did not find a significant correlation between Info DFR and QE; that is, Info DFR is not able to predict a successful application of QE in a second-pass ranking. These results show that the performance of query expansion is not directly related to query difficulty, consistent with the observation <ref type="bibr" coords="9,231.94,634.80,11.62,8.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that although the retrieval effectiveness of QE in general increases as the query difficulty decreases, very easy queries hurt performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.8">Conclusions on the selective application of QE</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="10,142.55,152.62,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_3">4</ref> we summarize the results on the selective application of QE. The MAP(X) values are not reported since the new values are similar to those in the official runs; thus we focus on the other measures. We compare the performance of the 4 submitted runs with QE with the performance of the new runs under the same setting except for the selective application of QE.</p><p>The first remark is that the decision rule for QE activation is quite robust. The MAP of the new runs is greater than the MAP of the official runs for a large range of values of the threshold parameter (&gt;= 0). In fact, InfoQ provides with a high degree of confidence the cases in which QE should be absolutely activated, which are the cases when InfoQ assumes very small negative values, as it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,320.74,260.21,3.74,8.97">3</ref>. This explains why the new value of MAP keeps constantly larger than the MAP obtained with all queries expanded. This decision method is thus safe.The behavior of Precision at 10 is more variable, depending on the choice of the threshold.</p><p>The second observation is that selective QE positively affects the NrTopicsNoRel measure. The new runs have almost the same NrTopicsNoRel performance as the unexpanded runs, and this was one of the main objectives of our investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Web track: topic distillation task</head><p>FUB participation in the topic distillation task of the Web track focused on only-content analysis.</p><p>Last year FUB didn't participate in this task, although the same baseline Information Retrieval system was employed by the Glasgow University (GU) <ref type="bibr" coords="10,359.69,423.70,13.17,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, GU analysed both the Absorbing Model and PageRank based algorithms for link analysis on top of our baseline IR system by using different content-link score combination approaches. Using the WEB corpus .GOV some utility functions combining link and text analyses were shown to moderately improve the performance over the baseline.</p><p>However, no query expansion technique was employed by GU in these TREC 11 experiments. As we successfully used query expansion for the "topic relevance task" at TREC 10, we checked whether the same strategy was also effective for the "topic distillation task" of TREC 11. The only modification we performed was to the value of the parameter c (from c = 7 to c = 1). We found that the application of the query expansion "as it was" applied in TREC 10 was still effective to the topic distillation task of TREC 11. Indeed, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,235.30,567.16,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_4">5</ref> we achieved better results than those reported by the best system participating in TREC 11. For topic distillation of this year we have applied exactly the same strategy as for the experiments on the TREC 11 collection.</p><p>However, official results show that the content-only term-weighting was not effective this year. The difference in performance is probably due to a change in the type of the task, with a different assessment of the notion of relevance. Judging from our results, the "topic distillation task of TREC 2002" looks very different from the "topic distillation task of TREC 2003". </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,77.67,139.74,411.02,9.82;7,77.67,153.28,384.38,9.82;7,84.76,164.46,396.86,199.46"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The number of relevant documents is inversely related to AP of the unexpanded query (ρ(Rel, AP) = -0.36).
