<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Identification of genes and proteins that affect biological function in humans and other organisms is a critical step in the discovery of new medicinal therapies. Automatic recognition of MEDLINE abstracts that describe gene/protein function would be of tremendous benefit to researchers in industry, government, and academia.</p><p>For example, drug discovery projects often begin with the identification of one or more diseaseassociated protein targets. Pharmaceutical biologists spend a large portion of their time combing the literature for research articles discussing novel protein targets. Automating this element of their jobs has the potential to result in accelerating the discovery process and reducing costs.</p><p>The first Genomics Track of the 12 th Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-12) was designed to provide a forum for those interested in developing systems capable of addressing the challenges posed by automatic recognition of gene and protein function. Axontologic and twenty-four other organizations from academia, government and industry participated in the primary task of the Track during the summer and fall of 2003. The official results of all of the participants are available on the TREC website. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,362.27,343.67,14.35,10.41" target="#b0">[1]</ref> This paper begins with an overview of the primary task of the Genomics Tracks. It describes our natural language processing inspired approach and discusses the results of our system . Finally, our conclusions are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary Task</head><p>The primary task of the Fifty test topics were released in late June. Each topic contained the gene names from a LocusLink record that was not part of the training set. Participants had until August 4 th to submit up to two test runs comprised of a ranked list of at most 1000 MEDLINE abstract identifiers for each of the 50 topics. The results of these runs were judged by the TREC evaluators and returned to the participants two weeks later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Our goal was to explore the use of simple syntax and domain semantics for recognizing gene/protein function and to lay the foundation for competition in future TREC events. Our system i s automatic and combines domain independent processing elements with a domain-specific lexicon.</p><p>After review of the training set it became clear that there were three challenges to be addressed. First, the gene names provided in the training topics were not comprehensive, i.e., some of the abstracts in the answer set did not mention the given names. Second, using gene names resulted in many false positives, because many of the retrieved documents did not discuss gene function. Third, LocusLink records are organism-specific, therefore, the system had to filter out abstracts that discuss gene function in other organisms. A fourth issue dealing with false negatives could not be addressed directly within the context of the task. We used the MG (Managing Gigabytes) system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.25,162.17,12.17,10.41" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to index the MEDLINE corpus. A strategy for heuristic query expansion was developed using a generative grammar. Query terms were expanded using simple grammar rules to handle hyphenation, complex punctuation and common gene name variations, e.g., "alpha-1a adrenergic receptor" vs. "adrenergic receptor alpha-1a." The expanded set of gene names was then fed to MG to retrieve a list of candidate abstracts from the corpus. We limited the number of retrieved documents to the first 5000 in our test runs. The ranking produced by MG was saved for later use.</p><p>A proprietary lexicon of terms indicative of gene or protein function was developed by analyzing the training data and other public-domain sources of functional information for genes including the Gene Ontology.</p><p>The lexicon includes verbs (cleave, inhibit, etc.), nominalizations (activation, regulation, etc.) and adverbs.</p><p>The ranked abstracts were parsed into sentences and the sentences were examined to l ocate query terms and function terms. The abstracts were scored using a function of the frequency of query term/function term pairs found in an abstract's sentences and their proximity to each other, i.e., a gene term adjacent to a function term ("caspase-3 cleavesâ€¦") is scored higher than a gene term/function term pair separated by many intervening words. The system differentiates between cases where the gene term is in the subject or object position of the function term and it handles passive constructions.</p><p>An additional check was made to verify that the organism of the query was contained in the MeSH terms of each returned abstract. Abstracts were ranked by their functional scores. If no query term/functional term pairs were found in an abstract, then the abstract was ranked using the o riginal MG ranking, after all those abstracts containing query/function pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Axontologic submitted two runs labeled axon1 and axon2 -the second run had a slightly more liberal query expansion grammar. The official results are shown in Tables <ref type="table" coords="3,141.30,293.42,6.26,10.41" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="3,175.48,293.42,4.64,10.41" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The results for the two runs were very close with axon2 doing slightly better in average precision (0.3173 compared to axon1's 0.3118). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>While these results were competitive, there is much more to be done. There were seven queries that axon2 did not meet the median average precision. Six of the seven queries involved problems with the names of the genes given in the topic. For example, in topic 4, the official gene name is given as "guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), alpha activating activity polypeptide, olfactory type".</p><p>There were two MEDLINE abstracts in the answer set for this query, 11901355 and 12037684. The gene names used in these two abstracts are synonyms for the official gene name that were not included in the topic: G-protein alpha(olf), AGalpha(olf), G-protein Golf, and Golf.</p><p>Topic 38 held a similar problem for our system. The topic used name "MIP-1alpha", but we missed answer abstracts that used lexical variations MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1alpha, and (MIP)-1alpha.</p><p>Our query expansion grammar did not correctly handle cases with multiple dashes.</p><p>Clearly the problem of gene name variability is a fundamental issue, much as word choice is in traditional information retrieval. If the MG system did not retrieve an answer abstract, then there was no way for later processing components to compensate for that. We plan to improve our query expansion grammar and to add additional gene synonyms from public domain sources.</p><p>On the positive side, there were five topics that one or both of axon1 and axon2 returned the best average precision score. Of these five, axon1 returned an average precision score that was several times greater than the median in topics 10, 14 and 42. To understand what happened with these query topics, we have compared the original MG ranking to the final axon1</p><p>ranking for the answer abstracts (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,129.15,86.42,21.71,10.41" target="#tab_4">3, 4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,181.77,86.42,4.26,10.41" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). In nearly every case, the rankings of target abstracts were improved by the use of function terms and in many cases the improvements were dramatic.  The strength of our method is in its ability to promote abstracts that discuss the function of the gene over those abstracts that simply mention the gene. In those cases where there are a large number of abstracts containing the topic gene names, our method has the potential to make significant improvements. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The Genomics track of TREC-12 provided an environment for developing, testing and evaluating computational methods for ranking abstracts by how well those abstracts describe t he function of genes.</p><p>Participating in TREC has increased our understanding of the problems researchers face and our solutions to those problems will be incorporated in Axontologic's future products.</p><p>We intend to bolster the query expansion component of the system to address the problem of not recognizing gene name synonyms in answer abstracts.</p><p>We are currently investigating more sophisticated methods of scoring that utilize finite state transducers and shallow syntactic parsing models. It is our belief that even simple methods, however, can be of value to the biomedical community given the large numbers of false negatives found by our system and that of the other competitors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="3,126.75,355.67,123.88,10.41"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Axon1 Results.</figDesc><table /></figure>
