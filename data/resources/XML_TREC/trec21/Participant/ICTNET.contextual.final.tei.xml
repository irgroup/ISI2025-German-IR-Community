Finally we use several methods to filter and generate descriptions for every web site that is returned in the results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Data Preparation</head><p>As there's no data set provided, we need a straightforward method to limit the candidate websites for this task. Geographical position is what we used to filter out the millions possible places. Yelp and Google Maps are both tried and we decide to use Yelp. We use Yelp API to query a place S and get a list of places that are nearest to S. There's a limitation of number of results returned by one yelp query, so we plot many places around S to get enough results from one single place. The keys returned by yelp API are as follows: latitude and longitude, name, category description, snippet text, homepage URL, reviews and business information of a place. The homepage URL is used by our spider to get the web pages on each place's homepage.7265 websites are downloaded as our dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Classification</head><p>In order to distinguish profiles from each other and keep diversity of the final results, a classification is needed.We separate the places into 6 classes represented by ABCDEF. The examples are classified manually. The places returned by Yelp API are classified according to their category description. A simple selected dictionary works well enough for this part, which saves our time on labeling training data. The classified examples are used to calculate the preference of each profile to each class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Description</head><p>We put much emphasis on this part as we consider that the description is most important part for a person to judge whether this is an appropriate suggestion except the class of the place.The following 4 steps are used to filter and generate description for each place/website: 1. Description in html meta data(Identify); 2. Business information from Yelp API; 3. Dynamic generation using Background Model(Generation); 4. Snippet text from Yelp API. These 4 steps are ordered by their qualifications of texts, not the difficulty of their implementations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Identification</head><p>It is obvious that the first one html meta data description is good enough if the editor of the html is experienced and write it seriously. The problem is how can we distinguish the good written</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" coords="3,91.50,74.85,316.85,189.89"><head></head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><graphic coords="3,91.50,74.85,316.85,189.89" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Use GENIA Tagger to carry out a POS tagging on the description.</p><p>3. Classify the description into 'Good' and 'Bad' by SVM classifier. Features we used include if there exists a verb, the length and the value of number of words divided by number of punctuations.</p><p>We identified 2283 good descriptions among 7265 websites. We randomly evaluated 100 from the 2283 description and believe that they are written by good editors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Result</head><p>We submitted two runs: ICTCONTEXTRUN1 and ICTCONTEXTRUN2. The results are as follows.</p><p>The ICTCONTEXTRUN1 is under both baselineA and baselineB in both tables. We take ICTCONTEXTRUN1 as our baseline that contains all the raw results we fetched.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Acknowledgements</head><p>The context suggestion track is the first year and no one in this group really know what results can we get and how can we get them. We spent a lot of time grabbing the data, not to speak of using a lot of proxies to bypass the strong regulations of Yelp's firewall. Not all we planned are implemented finally subject to the limited time. But these written in this report are indeed accomplished and worked not badly. We hope a dataset can be provided in the next year. Thanks a lot to the hard working members of our group and to the TREC committees. This work is sponsored by NSF of China Grants No. 60933005, and by 863 Program of China Grants No. 2012AA011003.</p></div>			</div>
