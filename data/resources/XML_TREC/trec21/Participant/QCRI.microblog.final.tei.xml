<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents the experiments and results for the QCRI participation in the TREC Microblog track 2012. In this year, we apply a query expansion approach for improving the retrieval results in microblog search. Our approach performs web-search with the original query to get web results appeared at the same period of the query; then it extracts the webpage title of the first web result and uses it as an expansion to the original query before applying microblog search. Our results show a significant improvement to the baseline and significantly better results than the median result achieved in the track. We also report one run in the filtering task that applies straightforward technique for retrieval score threshold selection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This is the second year for running the Microblog track in TREC including the ad-hoc search task, which is concerned with searching tweets for relevant topics. In addition, a new filtering task was introduced this year. Our contribution was mainly directed to the ad-hoc search task, while we applied a straightforward approach for the filtering task.</p><p>Topical ad-hoc search is not the most popular search task on Twitter, since users mainly perform search to get updates about some entities or celebrities, find friends, get insight about certain hashtags â€¦ etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,290.59,583.34,10.73,8.96" target="#b4">[ 5]</ref>. Applying search for getting information on a given topic as in web search is not the most common task on Twitter because of the social nature of the domain, and the short length of the tweets that are focused and into the point. This makes searching for topics in Microblogs challenging but exciting at the same time.</p><p>Several approaches were introduced by participants of the track last year for performing an effective ad-hoc search on Twitter <ref type="bibr" coords="1,337.15,652.34,10.74,8.96" target="#b3">[ 4]</ref>. These approaches included: applying machine learning techniques for reranking results based on some tweetsspecific features <ref type="bibr" coords="1,198.17,675.26,11.01,8.96" target="#b1">[ 2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,214.49,675.26,7.25,8.96" target="#b2">3]</ref>, text normalization to Twitter language to convert slang English words into proper language <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.02,149.58,10.99,8.96" target="#b5">[ 6]</ref>, applying query expansion using hashtags <ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.46,149.58,10.73,8.96" target="#b0">[ 1]</ref>, and many other approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.27,161.10,10.80,8.96" target="#b3">[ 4]</ref>. Based on the results of last year, we noticed that the most effective approaches are those that seek enriching the queries/tweets with additional terms for better matching, and those that use large number of features for reranking the top retrieval results to increase the precision <ref type="bibr" coords="2,365.89,195.66,11.07,8.96" target="#b1">[ 2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.14,195.66,7.25,8.96" target="#b2">3]</ref>. We explored some of these techniques on the TREC 2011 data collection to investigate the effectiveness of each. Our preliminary results on the training set from 2011 showed that reranking approached did not achieve a significant improvement to the retrieval effectiveness, which does not align with the results achieved in the track last year. We did not further investigate this approach, since it requires much processing for extracting useful features, especially when the features requires additional crawling of information from Twitter and the web as those used in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.43,276.09,10.66,8.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In contrast, we noticed from our experiments on the training set that pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) and query expansion in general always helps and usually leads to significantly better results. Therefore, we decided to focus our participation this year on query expansion techniques for the Microblog ad-hoc search task.</p><p>Regarding the newly introduced filtering task, we applied a straightforward approach for threshold selection based on maximizing the F-score.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the collection of tweets and how it was preprocessed for indexing; Section 3 presents our main query expansion approach for the ad-hoc task; Section 4 shows our experimental setup and the submitted runs to the track; Section 5 reports the results; and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preparing Collection for Indexing</head><p>According to the track guidelines, only English tweets are considered relevant. Thus, we extracted the English from the approximately 16 million crawled tweets of the collection. We used the language-detection open source Java library<ref type="foot" coords="2,419.50,488.72,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . A set of roughly 4.8 million English tweets were identified. We performed basic text tokenization where words were split on delimiters, except for "#" and "@" as they signify hashtags and user mentions respectively. All tweets starting with "RT", which indicates a retweet, were filtered out, since they are not considered relevant according to the track guidelines. This step reduced the number of English tweets to be indexed to almost 4.6 million tweets. Additionally, we removed all the URLs from the tweets text, since we assume that the URL text typically does not contain significant information in its own, and can cause some harm to the retrieval effectiveness.</p><p>The Indri search toolkit was used for indexing the collection of the 4.6 million tweets that were identified as English and non-retweets. Porter stemmer was applied during the indexing and search processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Web-based Pseudo Relevance Feedback</head><p>The main challenge in finding relevant tweets to a given topic is the absence of sufficient word matching between the search query and the short tweet text. We applied some experiments on the TREC 2011 data and noticed the PRF always helps in improving the retrieval effectiveness of search, since it expands the query with additional terms that leads to better matching of more relevant tweets. In the approach we used this year, we attempt to apply query expansion to the query terms, but from external resources instead of the tweets collection itself.</p><p>Since the provided topics are all time-stamped, we believe that this time stamp of the topic is relevant to an event that occurred at that time, and the main objective is to find tweets discussing this event. Hence, our approach is to use the query provided for each topic to search the web at that time for relevant webpages (expecting to be news or articles discussing the topic), and use it to extract additional terms to enrich the query before searching the tweets collection.</p><p>A block diagram to our web-based query expansion technique is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,462.97,326.97,3.76,8.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It works as follows:</p><p>1. The query of each of the topics is used to search Google at the time of the topic. In our experiments, the time was specified between the 25 th of January 2011 (the earliest date of tweets in the collection) and the date of the topic itself. This assures that the returned results will be relevant to that topic at the time of issuing on Twitter. 2. The first web result in Google search is taken, which can be a news article, a forum, an online video â€¦ etc. The title of the result is then extracted. 3. The extracted title is then automatically processed by taking the first part of the title and dropping the second part that appears after any of the delimiters {"-", "|"}. These delimiters usually contain the web domain name of the webpage; e.g. "CNN.com", "YouTube", "Wikipedia". 4. The extracted titles of the pages are then appended to the original query for the search process in the tweets collection. Since some of the extracted titles are much longer than the original query, and to not dominate the weight of the original query, the weights of the original and the expanded parts of the query are set equal, and the final retrieval score is computed as the geometrical mean between the scores of the two parts. 5. An additional PRF step could be added to further apply query expansion from the collection of tweets itself. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,171.71,579.98,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows an example of the topics and the corresponding extracted webpages titles that were used for the expansion. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,411.09,591.50,3.76,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, some of the extracted titles do not have any common words with original query. However, they are still relevant to the topic and leads to valuable enrichment to the query.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head><p>Here we describe our submitted runs to the TREC 2012 microblog track. We submitted four runs to the ad-hoc task, and one run to the filtering task</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Ad-Hoc Task</head><p>The four runs submitted to the track are as follows:</p><p>1. BL: The baseline run, where the queries of topics were taken without any modifications and used to search the collection. Indri was used for search. 2. BLFB: The same as baseline, but PRF was applied. The number of documents used for the feedback process was 50 tweets, and the number of expansion terms was set to 10. 3. QEWeb: Query expansion using the web was applied as discussed in pervious section. 4. QEWebFB: Similar to QEWeb, but PRF was applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Filtering Task</head><p>The submitted run for the filtering task applied a straightforward algorithm for detecting a threshold of the retrieval score to be used for filtering. The retrieval algorithm we used for this task used the same setup of the ad-hoc run QFWEBFB, since it showed the best results on our training data.</p><p>For detecting the retrieval score threshold (S 0 ) for the filtering process, we modelled the probability of relevant document given the retrieval score and the probability of the non-relevant document given the retrieval score as two normal distributions. We then inferred the parameters values using 80% of the training topics (8 topics in our case) of the training set and we use the remaining topics (2 topics) for tuning other optimization parameters. Initially, we maximized the precision by maximizing the expected number of the relevant document by setting it to its minimum value, where</p><p>. Later, we optimized the threshold by selecting the one that leads to the highest F-score.</p><p>Algorithm:</p><p>1-Set . 2-Find âˆ« âˆ«</p><p>3-4-If F-Score increased go to 2 else return</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>For the evaluation, we report the P@30, MAR, R-Prec, and ROC curves for our four submitted runs. These score are computed when considering only the highly relevant tweets (relevance&gt;2). In addition, we computed the scores when considering all the relevant tweets (relevance &gt; 0). For the filtering run, scores are reported as received from the track, which include four scores: precision, recall, F_0.5, and t11su.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,148.93,496.72,3.41,8.10">2</ref>. P@30, MAP, and R-Prec for the four submitted runs when considering only the highly relevant tweets (rel. = 2) vs. when considering all relevant tweets (rel. &gt; 0) for the ad-hoc search task  Table <ref type="table" coords="7,150.36,418.67,4.98,8.96">2</ref> shows the retrieval results of our runs for the ad-hoc task. It is very clear how query expansion leads to improvement to the retrieval effectiveness. The additional information added to the query from search the web led to a significant improvement compared to the baseline. Also, PRF leads to further improvement to the retrieval effectiveness. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,210.43,464.63,4.98,8.96" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents the ROC curves of the four runs. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,171.12,476.15,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_1">3</ref> reports our result for the filtering task. We are not sure how our technique performs compared to other algorithms, but we know that our scores is significantly higher than median achieved scores in the track.</p></div>
