<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The TREC 2012 Medical Records track fosters research in the retrieval of electronic health records using free text fields. These free text fields outline a set of inclusion criteria that specify a patient cohort, and must be satisfied in order for a record to be relevant. These criteria include demographic information (for example a patient's age, gender and eth-nicity) as well as their medical conditions or treatments.</p><p>The comprehensive nature of medical records pose numerous problems in accurately identifying patients who fit a very specific set of criteria. Firstly, there is the issue of vocabulary mismatch. For example "hypertension" may be noted as "high blood pressure", "HNT" or "HBT". To address this we use several knowledge sources and tools to identify and expand key medical concepts provided in queries. Medical records often describe a patient's medical history including that of relatives. Such issues are resolved with the use of a Condition Attribution and Temporal Grounding system that determines if a patient experienced a condition and if it is relevant to their current state. In order to identify highly specific information in verbose documents we aim to add structure to documents using machine learning and rule-based methods that is then leveraged using Indri's structured query language. This paper is structured as follows. Section 3 provides an overview of the task as well as the Indri retrieval model. Section 3 details the background technologies and motivation behind the systems developed at IIRG. Section 4 describes the submitted runs and the results of their evaluation. Discussion and conclusions are put forward in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Search Task</head><p>The goal of the Medical Records track is to foster research on providing content-based access to the free-text fields of electronic medical records<ref type="foot" coords="2,268.83,73.81,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The 2012 task builds on the previous year with the aim of identifying cohorts of patients who fit a set of criteria that describe their medical status as well as key demographic information, known as inclusion criteria. The queries for this task take the form of natural language text specifying a set of inclusion criteria, e.g. Children with dental caries. The test corpus comprises 101,700 de-identified medical records obtained from the University of Pittsburgh NLP repository<ref type="foot" coords="2,92.61,209.30,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . The unit of retrieval for this task is a visit, which is composed of multiple records that relate to the same medical episode. A mapping report is provided for the task in order to create these 17,265 visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Indri Structured Query Language</head><p>The systems described in this paper all use the Indri<ref type="foot" coords="2,294.32,304.57,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_2">3</ref> IR engine, that combines inference model and language model approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.25,333.72,113.86,9.46" target="#b3">(Metzler and Croft, 2004)</ref>. This model was chosen as the basis for the systems described in this paper because of its ability to handle phrases as well as its robust structured query language, one aspect of this query language is the ability for field restriction. Field restriction limits the matching of an expression to a particular field found within indexed documents. For example, the query "shakespeare.author" would ensure that documents matching shakespeare in the author field are returned. On the corpus side, field extents are identified using XMLlike markup, e.g. &lt;author&gt;shakespeare&lt;/author&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Background &amp; Motivation</head><p>This section outlines the technologies and motivation behind UCD IIRG's submissions to the TREC 2012 Medical Track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Demographic Information</head><p>A key aspect in identifying patient cohorts is the resolution of demographic information. Demographic information includes attributes such as age and gender as well as ethnicity. Age group information is identified in the Pittsburgh dataset through their own de-identification process. Gender and ethnicity is extracted using a set of regular expression rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Condition Identification, Condition</head><p>Attribution &amp; Temporal Grounding</p><p>In order to identify medical conditions in text, an implementation of the IndexFinder algorithm was used <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.75,183.41,73.58,9.46" target="#b5">(Zou et al., 2003)</ref>. However as medical records must give a complete description of a patient's healthcare profile, they are necessarily word-heavy. This includes a description of familial medical conditions (e.g. father's diabetes) as well as past medical history (e.g. past admission with wrist fracture).</p><p>A Condition Attribution and Temporal Grounding system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,346.58,278.25,90.95,9.46" target="#b0">(Cogley et al., 2012)</ref> is used to resolve such occurrences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Indexing</head><p>The systems described in Sections 3.2 and 3.1 were used to mark field extents describing age, gender, ethnic origin as well as information regarding past, present and familial medical conditions. The markup tags used in the system are outlined in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,522.61,385.81,4.09,9.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Following the identification of required information, visit documents were created. The visit documents are created using a simple shell script to concatenate a visits constituent reports. The script reads the mapping file provided by TREC, which mapped reports to visits using unique identifiers. Indexes were then built from these visit documents. The index was left unstemmed in order to avoid problem instances such as 'AIDS' stemmed to 'AID'. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Structured Retrieval</head><p>Following the identification of fields in documents using the systems described in previous sections, this information may be manipulated using Indri's structured retrieval and field restrictions. As a result highly specific queries (1) may be translated to structured queries (2).</p><p>1. Elderly adults with a past admission for fractures 2. elderly.AGEGRP adults with a past admission for fractures.PASTCOND</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Query Expansion</head><p>Medical literature is a rich source of synonymy and in an IR context vocabulary mismatch is an often encountered issue <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.94,269.11,121.16,9.46" target="#b2">(Limsopatham et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To combat these problems, query expansion is employed. Both manual and automatic methods are used, as detailed below. Concept Re-Ranking <ref type="bibr" coords="3,112.60,323.31,88.41,9.46" target="#b4">(Stokes et al., 2007)</ref>, a method developed to address the issues arising when a document contains multiple references to the same concept term, is also enforced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Manual</head><p>The query is submitted to PubMed<ref type="foot" coords="3,233.05,402.97,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . Pubmed creates chunks from this query which represent entries in MeSH <ref type="bibr" coords="3,117.94,432.11,100.99,9.46" target="#b1">(Johnston et al., 2002)</ref>. A manual systematic lookup is then performed on these entries at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh i.e. All synonyms are then taken from these results and added to the original query. No manual filtering of appropriate terms was conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Automatic</head><p>Concepts are identified using the MetaMap tool. Expansions are then generated using one or more of the following: the MetaMap tool; queries to PubMed; the knowledge graph FreeBase<ref type="foot" coords="3,262.46,579.52,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . The queries are then automatically generated using these expansions and a rule based system translates the queries to Indri's structured query language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Submitted Systems</head><p>Four systems were submitted by UCD IIRG to this year's Medical Track. They are as follows.</p><p>• UCDCSI1 A manual run using MeSH based expansions, Indri's structured query language to specify demographic information and Concept Re-Ranking.</p><p>• UCDCSI2 A manual run using MeSH based expansions, Indri's structured query language to specify demographic information such as ages and Concept Re-Ranking. Furthermore it uses field-based retrieval in order to utilise more specific information regarding medical conditions namely determining the experiencer and whether or not it occurred in the past.</p><p>• UCDCSI3 An automatic run using MeSH based expansions, Indri's structured query language to specify demographic information such as ages and Concept Re-Ranking.</p><p>• UCDCSI4 An automatic run using MeSH based expansions and Indri's structured query language to specify demographic information such as ages without Concept Re-Ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Results</head><p>This section describes the performance of the four runs submitted to the TREC 2012 Medical Track by UCD IIRG. The submissions consisted of two manual runs UCDCSI1, UCDCSI2 and two automatic runs UCDCSI3 and UCDCSI4. Four metrics, infAP, infNCDG, R-prec and Precision @ 10 (P @ 10) are used to evaluate all submissions. 88 runs were submitted in total to the track. Of the 88 submitted,6 were manual with the remaining 82 automatic. Tables 2 and 3 display the results of UCD IIRG's submissions and the hypothetical Max and Median runs, respectively. Although the automated submission UCDCSI4 performs moderately well, it does so using very basic rules in order to translate natural language queries into Indri's complex query language that requires the knowledge of domain experts. The ramifications of this are discussed in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>In this section, we present a discussion of the results of UCD IIRG's submissions to TREC Medical Track 2012, both in respect to one another and the hypothetical max and median runs.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,114.37,536.76,5.45,9.46" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays the per topic infAP score of the maximum and median participant results along with the authors' top performing submission, UCDCSI1.</p><p>UCDCSI1 matches the best performing runs on six occasions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,135.41,590.96,22.72,9.46">(136,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,162.63,590.96,19.09,9.46">138,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,186.22,590.96,19.09,9.46">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,209.79,590.96,19.09,9.46">158,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,233.38,590.96,19.09,9.46">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,256.95,590.96,18.18,9.46">184)</ref>. Of these six queries, the median also matched on performace <ref type="bibr" coords="4,111.01,618.05,22.72,9.46">(143,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,137.15,618.05,18.18,9.46">178)</ref>. Both of these queries are relatively simple e.g. Patients who have had a carotid endarterectomy, which explains their high performance. UCDCSI1 outperforms the median runs on queries with age group information, Children with dental caries and secondary information, Patients with esophageal cancer who develop pericardial effusion.</p><p>In total, UCDCSI1 equals the score of the median run on 16 topics <ref type="bibr" coords="4,419.02,89.41,22.72,9.46">(137,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,447.22,89.41,19.09,9.46">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,471.79,89.41,19.09,9.46">145,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,496.34,89.41,19.09,9.46">147,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,520.91,89.41,19.09,9.46">148,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,313.20,102.96,19.09,9.46">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,336.28,102.96,19.09,9.46">152,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,359.36,102.96,19.09,9.46">155,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,382.44,102.96,19.09,9.46">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,405.51,102.96,19.09,9.46">165,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,428.60,102.96,19.09,9.46">168,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,451.67,102.96,19.09,9.46">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,474.75,102.96,19.09,9.46">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,497.83,102.96,19.09,9.46">179,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,520.91,102.96,19.09,9.46">182,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,313.20,116.50,18.18,9.46">185)</ref>. These queries ranged from quite simple criteria such as Patients with Ischemic Vascular Disease that achieved high scores to very complex queries such as topic 141, Adult inpatients with Alzheimer's disease admitted from nursing homes with pressure ulcers or queries that had limited expansions such as Patients with inflammatory disorders receiving TNFinhibitor treatments that produced very low scores.</p><p>There is a significant difference in the performances of UCDCSI1 and UCDCSI2 with UCDCSI1 achieving consistently higher scores as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,387.07,266.77,4.09,9.46" target="#tab_1">4</ref>. These results indicate that the introduction of further information relating to conditions in the query may be too strict.</p><p>The automatic submissions UCDCSI3 and UCDCSI4 are significantly outperformed by the max and median runs. An important point of note is the increase in performance of UCDCSI4 over UCDCSI3 on the removal of concept Re-Ranking. There are two causes for this. First, as they are automatic runs they are susceptible to the inaccuracies of the concept identification tool. Secondly, only medical conditions were identified in the queries, giving them a much higher weighting than equally important concepts such as treatments, medications and demographic information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>As part of TREC Medical track 2012, we investigated several problem areas in the retrieval of medical documents. These submissions investigated the areas of query expansion, automated query translation from natural language to Indri's structured query language and the use of specific demographic information about patients including their age, gender and information relating to their medical status. Four submissions were made in investigation of these problem areas. Two runs were manually created with the others using automatically generated queries. The manual query UCDCSI1 matched, on average the median run. However, this approach encountered difficulty with queries that had few expansions as well as verbose queries. The use of more specific information such as the attribution and temporal grounding of medical conditions saw a decrease in performance. The automatic runs were outperformed by the max and median runs, highlighting difficulties in concept identification as well as the automated translation of natural language queries to a structured format.</p><p>This leads to future work in performing more accurate concept identification as well as further refining the translation of natural language queries. Furthermore the expansion resources used for this task proved to be limited, thus failing to resolve fully the effects of vocabulary mismatch.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,164.48,361.09,283.05,9.46"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: infAP Max, Median and UCDCSIrun1 scores per topic</figDesc></figure>
