<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In our TREC participation, we used an ensemble approach in query expansion. Query expansion, such as synonym expansion, had shown promising results in medical literature search. On the other hand, some of the 2011 papers reported worse results from expansion. Since there are multiple knowledge sources available and each resource has clear strengths and weaknesses, we tested the combination of three expansion methods versus each individual method.</p><p>We found that the ensemble approach performed better (in terms of average infAP, infNDCG, R-prec, and P10) than the individual methods and better than the Lucene baseline. The individual expansion methods, however, did not improve the baseline Lucene performance. We also performed an unofficial run using a concept index to boost the query performance, which led to small improvements in infAP, infNDCG, and R-prec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>In our own previous studies we have found query expansion to have varying impact depending on the specific queries and the corpus being searched. In one study synonym and predication expansion improved F-measure and recall but reduced precision <ref type="bibr" coords="1,271.61,401.37,10.69,8.96" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In a subsequent study they improved MAP scores, but only topic model improved P10. Importantly, precision was not significantly reduced <ref type="bibr" coords="1,447.43,412.91,10.71,8.96" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. An ensemble method was used in the second study that is different from the one used in this study. That ensemble method used semantic distance to combine the scores of the other methods, but overall it underperformed the individual methods. In this study we used a different ensemble method that uses a simpler summing of weights rather than semantic distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>In this TREC experiment, our method involved a number of steps with query expansion being the key step (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,121.78,518.75,3.62,8.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept extraction</head><p>For each query, we first used V3NLP (3), a concept extraction tool, to identify segments of text that can be mapped to medical concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query reformulation</head><p>Our system then preprocesses and modifies the original query through stop word removal, query expansion, and word level boosting.</p><p>Stop word removal: We removed words in our stop word list from the queries. Our stop word list is a merged list of common English stop words and high frequency words in document collection (Table <ref type="table" coords="2,493.90,205.14,3.66,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Query expansion: In this study we experimented with three expansion methods plus an ensemble method that incorporated the results of the other three. The three methods were synonym expansion, relation expansion, and predication expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Synonyms:</head><p>In this study, we define synonymous terms as the set of concept names belonging to the same unique concept according to a controlled vocabulary. Synonym expansion has been used in previous studies with varying success. Positive results have been obtained using UMLS synonyms when restricting results to the MeSH vocabulary (4). We have implemented a similar approach by using UMLS synonyms with a restricted set of source vocabularies.</p><p>We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS. We first attempted to map query terms to UMLS concepts using MetaMap, restricting mapping to those scoring -1000 and coming from one of the data sources SNM, NOMEDCT, MSH, or ICD. If this was unsuccessful then we used a term-toconcept lookup table (derived from the MRCONSO table in UMLS, with non-informative terms removed) to find matching concepts. We then used our MRCONSO derived term-to-concept table to identify all terms for the concepts and used those terms as synonyms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relations:</head><p>In this study, we define related terms as the set of concept names belonging to the same concept where that concept has a relation to the query term's concept according to a controlled vocabulary. Relations used for query expansion have also shown promise <ref type="bibr" coords="3,270.53,120.06,10.69,8.96" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Some relations are more informative than others, so in addition to restricting the set of source vocabularies we assigned weights to the different categories of relations.</p><p>For related terms, query terms were first mapped to UMLS concepts using MetaMap and the term-toconcept table in the same manner as for synonyms. We then queried related concepts from the metathesaurus MRREL table. We ranked related concepts by summing their weights, with weights assigned by relation category. We assigned weights of: 2 to child relationships; 0 to not related, no mapping, allowed qualifier, and can be qualified by relationships; and 1 to all remaining relationship categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predications:</head><p>Aside from vocabulary-defined relations, related terms can be identified from other sources such as predication in published medical literature. In this study, we used SemRep which is an NLP system which identifies predications in biomedical documents <ref type="bibr" coords="3,287.81,281.13,10.69,8.96" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. It builds on the MetaMap application, SPECIALIST lexicon, and Xerox part-of-speech tagger to assign semantic types to noun phrases and identify lexical variants. Evaluation studies have shown its precision to be approximately 75%. We identified predications from a sample corpus where the object was one of the query terms and used the subject of those predications for expansion terms.</p><p>To derive expansion terms from predications, we used a database of predications that was generated by running the SemRep program on 10 years of MEDLINE citations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,363.31,361.65,22.17,8.96">(1999)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.48,361.65,4.43,8.96">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.91,361.65,22.17,8.96">(2009)</ref>. We used the subjects of predications where the object of the predication was a query term. We ranked the subjects by frequency to obtain a ranked list of expansion terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ensemble:</head><p>We used an ensemble method to incorporate synonym, relation, and predication expansion into a single result set. Our technique was to normalize the scores from the other methods to values between 0 and 1 using the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,108.02,478.38,246.58,35.11">if ( ) &gt; 0 : ( ) ( ( )) ( ( ( ))) if ( ) = 0 : ( )</formula><p>where is the query term is a related term is any related term s is the source of the expansion The final rank for each expansion term was obtained by summing the scores from the 3 methods. Examples of the expansion results can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,271.05,610.70,3.76,8.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Boosting weight for rare words: Testing on the 2011 TREC queries, we observed from the previous year (2011) TREC queries containing content words (e.g. medication name) tend to lead to higher precision while those with functional words (in the medical context) such as "developed" or "receiving" lead to many false positives. We also observed that content words tend to have lower frequency, though this is not always true. By assigning each word the inverse document frequency (IDF) as their boosting weight, we gave infrequent words more weight than frequent words. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lucene Search</head><p>We used Lucene version 3.6.1 as the base search engine to test our query expansion methods. We created a Lucene index from the one hundred thousand TREC documents. Query results by Lucene include document IDs and scores in range [0 1] resulting from cosine similarity calculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negation Filtering</head><p>We dedicated a separate run to measure the impact of negation terms (e.g No, not) on the TREC corpus.</p><p>The idea is to conduct two parallel queries: the original query and the negated query. The negated query is the expansion of the original query with negation terms preceding each word. For example, the negated version of "miscarriage^3.35" includes "no miscarriage"^3.35 and "not miscarriage"^3.35. If a document is the result of both original query and negated query, its score is recalculated by subtracting the original score to negated score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Boosting</head><p>Our last experiment (ConceptBoost) used a concept-based indexing method to modify the ranking list of ensemble method. An UMIA-based NLP pipeline Sophia to map medical terms into UMLS CUIs which are then indexed the cuis using Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="5,259.25,435.23,10.89,8.96" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,274.13,435.23,7.34,8.96" target="#b7">8)</ref>. For example, the term "Hepatitis C" is mapped to CUI C0019196. Traditional word based method adds 2 word "Hepatitis" and "C" to the index dictionary while concept method only requires indexing CUI "C0019196" as one entry in concept index. We removed from index the negated concepts detected by Sophia. All queries are translated to CUIs using the sample pipeline, and those CUIs were searched against concept index.</p><p>We used concept queries to boost the results of ensemble method. Similar to "Negation Filtering" method, we construct two parallel queries, and the intersected documents of two lists are added score by 1 to push them up to the top of ranked list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aggregation</head><p>We tried three ways of aggregating (MAX, SUM, AVERAGE) document scores into visit scores. When testing on TREC 2011 data, we observed that using the MAX function yielded higher performance. Hence, we used MAX aggregation in our submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation</head><p>We submitted 4 automatic runs to the TREC 2012 Medical Records Track. The BMIUOUsyn used a synonym expansion method. The BMIUOUbase is the baseline evaluation using the default Lucene engine using our own stop word list. The BMIUOUens run uses the ensemble expansion methods. Lastly, BMIUOUensneg uses the ensemble method with very simple negation filtering.</p><p>The results we received used 4 evaluation metrics: inferred average precision (infAP), inferred normalized discounted cumulated gain (infNDCG), Precision at 10(P@10), and R-precision (R-prec). infAP measures average precision while taking into account the incompleteness of relevance judgments.. Using the relevance judgment set provided by TREC, We extended the evaluation to compare individual expansion method (Predication, Synonym, Relation). We also performed a run without reformulation (LuceneBase) as control. The * indicates the experiment results are submitted to TREC for the official evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Overall, our ensemble and negation methods did better than the median and Lucene baseline (Table <ref type="table" coords="6,511.18,366.21,3.63,8.96" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>Original query with stop word removal (BMIUOUbase) didn't perform as good as the median. We also report original query without stop word removal in the evaluation extension section. Our best submission is the ensemble with negation filtering method although there is little difference from the ensemble without negation. We also counted the number of queries for each method that did better, equal or worse than the median. In table 6, for instance, the ensemble method performed better in 25 queries than the median (infAP), but worse in 19 queries. The individual expansion methods performed worse than our Lucene baseline while the ensemble method performed better than the baseline. We also note that removing stop words improved the Lucene default performance.</p><p>Using parallel query for reordering ranked list contributes to overall performance. While the "Negation Filtering" impact is insignificant, the use of concept indexing to boost traditional word based query is showing significant improvement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Although Lucene is a powerful search engine, our ensemble method did perform better than our baseline Lucene runs. Particularly worth noting is that each individual expansion method did not perform very well. However, combining the methods did show improvements. When we tested our methods on the 2011 TREC, we observed somewhat different results: the ensemble as well as individual expansion methods performed better on bpref but worse on P10 than the baseline Lucene.</p><p>Our methods often didn't perform well in queries involving age-specific references. For example, some queries (136, 141,164, 169,170,173,174, and 175) contain keywords: Children, Adults, Elderly. Our expansion term methods are not very helpful when applied to these keywords. Since age is typically available as structured data, we did not develop special functions to handle these keywords.</p><p>The concept boosting method has demonstrated beneficial effect on retrieval performance. Concept-based search alone do not outperformed word-based search. This can be attributed to the fact that concept extraction tools are imperfect and do miss some concepts. Despite this, a document retrieved by both concept and word-indexing methods has a higher chance of being the relevant document.
