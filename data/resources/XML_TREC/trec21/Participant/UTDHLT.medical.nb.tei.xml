<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the updated system created by the University of Texas at Dallas for content-based medical record retrieval submitted to the TREC 2012 Medical Records Track. Our system updates our work from the previous year by building a structured query for each cohort that captures the patient's age, gender, hospital status, and medical assertion information. Further, all keywords that encode any medical phenomena from the query are recursively decomposed before being expanded using knowledge from UMLS, SNOMED, Wikipedia, and PubMed co-occurrences. An initial ranking of hospital visits is then obtained using BM25 relevance on an interpolation of these decomposed keywords. Finally, hospital visits are re-ranked according to the constraints extracted in the structured query. Four runs were submitted, comparing pair-wise combinations of complete vs. shallow keyword decomposition and full vs. negation-only assertion processing. Our highest scoring submission achieved an infNDCG score of 0.426.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As electronic medical records (EMRs) become more ubiquitous throughout the healthcare industry, the necessity of robust, domain-aware information retrieval techniques emerges. In particular, the need to quickly and accurately retrieve medical records correspond-ing to specific medical constraints -the ability to retrieve patient cohorts cohorts -will be of critical importance as the industry continues to embrace new technologies.</p><p>This type of content-based, domain-specific retrieval is precisely what the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2012 medical records track intends to advance. A continuation of the track which began in TREC 2011, participants were provided with a corpus of free-text electronic medical records (EMRs)<ref type="foot" coords="1,507.91,412.10,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and a mapping from each EMR to its corresponding hospital visit<ref type="foot" coords="1,328.70,436.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Additionally, the thirty-five evaluation queries from TREC 2011 were provided for training or tuning usage. These queries (referred to as topics by the task organizers) each target a specific hospital patient cohort, characterized by various medical phenomena, as evidenced in table <ref type="table" coords="1,405.03,497.36,3.87,8.74">1</ref>.</p><p>The task requires that participants return a ranked list of hospital visits, such that the rank of each hospital visit indicates the degree by which its associated EMRs are relevant<ref type="foot" coords="1,392.08,544.19,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> to the given query.</p><p>The remainder of this text is outlined as follows.

This is followed by an in-depth discussion of how we retrieve of hospital visits within the Retrieval module as explained in section 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Architecture</head><p>What follows is a brief outline of the architecture of our system (illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,219.40,593.82,3.95,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), followed by an in-depth look at each component.</p><p>The queries presented in this task convey a variety of complex semantic constraints on the targeted patient cohort. As such, our system begins by first detecting these cohort constraints and representing them in a structured form that the computer understands. We accomplish this through the Query Analysis module which consists of several submodules for distilling patient age (e.g. elderly, children), patient gender(e.g. women, male patients), hospital status (e.g. presenting to the emergency room, discharged from the hospital, admitted with), or medical assertion 4 status which captures the existence, absence or uncertainty of medical phenomena (e.g. without a diagnosis of x, family history of x, recommended for possible x). Next, the actual medical phenomena itself is detected by the Keyword Extraction module. In this phase keywords are recognized from the query and recursively decomposed into sub-keywords. Additionally, because of the incredible diversity within the diction used throughout the electronic medical records, each keyword is expanded using the following knowledge sources:</p><p>1. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus 2. The English Wikipedia redirect database 3. The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) 2011</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">PubMed Central co-occurrence information</head><p>After the queries have been thoroughly dissected, an initial ranked list of hospital visits is acquired using Apache Lucene 4.0's BM25 retrieval implementation. Then, this initial ranked list of hospital visits is reranked using the knowledge gleaned from the Query Analysis module to yield the final ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Query Analysis</head><p>Our Query Analysis module is motived by the thirty-five queries from TREC 2011 as well as the practice queries provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) 5 . These queries presented an extraordinary variety of complex constraints on their desired 4 A useful description of medical assertions is provided in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,72.00,619.94,110.12,6.99" target="#b4">Roberts and Harabagiu [2011]</ref>.</p><p>5 NIST endorsed sixty practice topics generated by the NLM based on a priorities published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). These queries are available currently for TREC participants only at http://trec.nist.gov/act_part/tracks/ medical/NLM_sample_topics.txt.</p><p>patient cohort that require more semantic reasoning than basic keyword matching. As such, based on our analysis of the 2011 and NLM queries, we created four sub-modules to detect any patient age, medical assertion, hospital status, and patient gender constraints imposed by the query, which are described in the following sub-sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Assertion Detection</head><p>The cohorts queried in this task are characterized by medical problems, medical treatments, and medical tests. However, as indicated in table 2, the existence, absence or uncertainty of these medical problems treatments or tests may vary. This information -the belief state of a concept -is known as an assertion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query Excerpt</head><p>Assertion Value without a diagnosis of x ABSENT with a history of x HISTORICAL recommended for possible x POSSIBLE <ref type="table" coords="3,310.25,400.45,34.41,8.74">Table 2:</ref> Examples of detected assertions from TREC queries.</p><p>In order to detect this information, we manually annotated the assertion status of 2,349 medical concepts (1,183 problems, 614 tests, 552 treatments) and used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to trained on these annotations to the classify the status of each concept identified in a given query. Our assertion detection technique follows that described in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,505.57,508.93,33.68,8.74;3,310.61,520.88,93.44,8.74" target="#b4">Roberts and Harabagiu [2011]</ref>. We use six-way classification of belief status at the concept level, as well as similar features (both for concept detection and assertion classification). Finally, we also utilize the same methods for feature selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Age Detection</head><p>Although somewhat rare, some queries targeted patients characterized by a specific age, or age range (such as query 119 in table 1 which targets adult patients only). Patient age information is detected according to manually created grammar extrapolated from the sixty practice topics provided by the National Library of Medicine. Our grammar is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,122.78,151.87,93.30,8.74" target="#b2">Goodwin et al. [2011]</ref> captures queries of the form patients younger than x, patients at most x years old, as well as ranges such as patients in their thirties to sixties. We also detect common age ranges based on a lexicon of known phrases, such as children, elderly, adult have been manually mapped to their numerical ranges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discovering Hospital Status</head><p>Queries such as those in table 3 reveal another trend among the cohorts targeted by the TREC medical records task -hospital status. We observed three such criteria, that occurred frequently throughout the 2011 and NLM practice queries: Admission, Discharge, and Emergency Room. The desired hospital status was detected by comparing the lemmatized query against a small set of simple patterns, given in table <ref type="table" coords="4,294.98,353.49,3.80,8.74" target="#tab_0">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Gender Detection</head><p>Our inspection of the 2011 and NLM practice queries revealed that some cohorts target specific patient genders. For example, the query 112 from table 1 requires only visits pertaining to female patients. In order to detect this information, we created a high-precision lexicon of words that denote male subjects, and another that denotes female subjects. These lexicons are available in tables <ref type="table" coords="4,408.65,151.87,4.98,8.74">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,436.33,151.87,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">5</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Keyword Extraction</head><p>The queries presented in the TREC 2011 and 2012 medical record track target specific patient cohorts: groups of people constrained by specific medical problems, treatments, or tests. As such, we must detect these constraints -which we cast as keywords -and represent them in a machine-readable format. We accomplish this through the Keyword Extraction module.</p><p>Because medical phenomena are often represented through multi-token, complex nominal phrases, typical keyword extraction loses the semantics encoded by the syntactic structure of the query. Consider, for example, the major phenomena -keywords -extracted from the queries given in table 1: query 104 contains localized prostate cancer and treated with robotic surgery; query 106 contains positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, staging, monitoring, and cancer ; query 112 contains breast cancer, mastectomies; and query 119 contains anion gap acidosis and insulin dependent diabetes. But how do we know which token sequences constitute a keyword, and when to decompose a token sequence into separate keywords?</p><p>We recursively consider all sub-sequences of tokens from each query and check if that sequence corresponds to an article title in Wikipedia. This allows us to capture virtually any medical concept as well as common abbreviations, misspellings, short-hand, phrasal verbs, noun collocations and synonyms. However, many common phrases and stopwords exist as Wikipedia articles. To combat this, we ensure that any matched sequence occurs less than a threshold, λ<ref type="foot" coords="5,77.81,233.98,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">6</ref> , within the PubMed Central open access subset of biomedical text<ref type="foot" coords="5,139.25,245.94,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">7</ref> .</p><p>Finally, each keyword extracted is decomposed so that it contains, as sub-keywords, any phrases within it which would themselves satisfy the keyword criteria. For example, the keyword lower extremity chronic wound in figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,146.40,313.49,5.08,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref> contains the sub-keywords lower extremity and chronic wound ; sub-keyword lower extremity thus, contains the sub-sub-keywords lower and extremity, while sub-keyword chronic wound contains sub-sub-keywords chronic and wound. The purpose of collecting a hierarchy of sub-keywords in this way is so that the relationship between them may be retained when retrieval is performed. Within natural language, particularly within medical records, the morphology of words varies extraordinarily both within and between medical texts. To mitigate this diversity of diction, we expand each keyword so as that it may match a variety of lexical forms encompassing synonymy, metonymy, and hyponymy as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,382.11,222.21,96.39,8.74" target="#b2">Goodwin et al. [2011]</ref>. In order to ease slight variation in syntax, the following simple keyword expansions are performed:</p><p>• a WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="5,381.75,269.54,68.77,8.74" target="#b1">Fellbaum [1998]</ref> lemmatized form</p><p>• an unabbreviated form based on an internal list of common medical abbreviations</p><p>• a form in which all hyphens are padded by spaces</p><p>• a form in which all hyphens are replaced by spaces</p><p>• a form in which all punctuation is removed Simple surface form variations are not enough to capture the range of terms doctors use to describe their patients conditions. For example, consider the term stroke. This phrase may be referred to as apoplexy, brain attack, or cerebrovascular accident. In order to capture this degree of synonymy, we utilize the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus <ref type="bibr" coords="5,380.56,474.29,95.26,8.74" target="#b6">Schuyler et al. [1993]</ref>. The UMLS Metathesaurus is a medical ontology which aggregates knowledge from RxNorm, MeSH, SNOMED and other sources. We utilize this knowledge by expanding a given keyword so that it also matches all lexical forms which map to the same concept ID within the UMLS Metathesaurus database.</p><p>Despite the high precision achieved by incorporating knowledge from UMLS Metathesaurus, the recall was not sufficient for our needs. The terms used in the electronic medical records contained spelling variations and a wide variety of slang or less precise synonymy than UMLS encodes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged the English version of Wikipedia. We used a list of all redirect articles -pages that send the reader to a new article rather rather than containing information on their own. These redirect articles suite our needs because they typically correspond to alternate names, spellings, lexical forms, related words, or hyponyms. We use this information by expanding a given keyword such that it corresponds to any lexical forms used as article titles that redirect to the given keyword. For example, using Wikipedia redirects expansions allows us to expand the keyword hearing loss to auditory impairment, deaf, deafness, hard of hearing, hearing damage.</p><p>While synonymy and alternations are sufficient for many keyword matches, some questions are constrained by information that requires greater reasoning. Consider, for example, the keyword, atypical antipsychotics. Doctors will not use this phrase as-is in their records, but rather, will use hypernyms or metonyms -specific types of atypical antipsychotics in its place. In order to match this kind of variation, we incorporation the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). SNOMED CT is an ontology of clinical terms maintained by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation which documents both clinical terms and, more importantly, the relationships between them. We incorporate this knowledge by expanding a given keyword so as to match any lexical form encoded in SNOMED CT that partakes in the child side of an is a, part of, or component relationship. By doing so, the keyword atypical antipsychotics may be expanded to include abilify, aripiprazole, asenapine, clozapine, clozaril.</p><p>While the previous keyword expansion techniques are sufficient for most scenarios, the text of electronic medical records is often terse, disjoint, and ungrammatical. Additionally, some keywords may require more domain knowledge than what we are able to simulate with mere keyword expansion. As a fall-back, to help mitigate this domain knowledge rift, we expand keywords so that they correspond to related terms. We calculate these related terms using co-occurrence information gleaned from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMC), a collection of freely available biomedical texts. Related was determined by considering the normalized Google distance <ref type="bibr" coords="6,243.06,665.94,57.58,8.74;6,310.23,127.96,59.89,8.74" target="#b0">Cilibrasi and Vitanyi [2007]</ref>. The NGD(x, y) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,346.88,148.29,156.09,22.31">max{log f (x), log f (y)} -log f (x, y) log M -min{log f (x), log f (y)}</formula><p>where M is the total number of documents in PMC; f (x) and f (y) are the number of documents containing terms x and y, respectively; and f (x, y) is the number of documents in which x and y co-occur.</p><p>We selected the top twenty expansions of sufficient similarity<ref type="foot" coords="6,352.47,239.83,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">8</ref> as the expansions for each keyword. For example, atypical antipsychotics acquired olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine, and antipsychotic drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Hospital Visit Retrieval</head><p>After extracting and expanding the keywords that characterize a patient cohort, we must retrieve all relevant hospital visits that match the extracted keywords. This task is accomplished through the use of Apache Lucene 4.0 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,395.60,379.76,138.92,8.74" target="#b3">Hatcher and Gospodnetic [2005]</ref>.</p><p>Prior to retrieval, we created an index over all hospital visits by merging all the electronic medical records associated with each hospital visit into a single document. The various fields encoded in each EMR were retained when indexed (admit diagnosis, chief complaint, etc) so that per-field weights could be adjusted.</p><p>For retrieval, each query is represented as an interpolation of its decomposed keywords and their weighted expansions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,322.01,519.98,205.83,83.39">query(k, λ) = λ[k+α UMLS(k) +β Wikipedia(k) +γ SNOMED(k) +δ Co-Occurrence(k)] + s∈sub-keywords(k) query(s, µλ)</formula><p>where λ is the initial keyword score; α, β, γ and δ, are the weights associated with the respective keyword expansion method; and µ is the discounting factor 0 &lt; µ &lt; 1 (we used λ = 16, α = 12, β = 10, γ = 8, δ = 1, and µ = 0.5). The queries were represented in Lucene using nested SpanNear and SpanOr queries, and relevance was judged using the Okapi BM25 ranking function <ref type="bibr" coords="7,112.27,175.78,129.38,8.74" target="#b5">Robertson and Walker [1994]</ref>. This yields a ranked list of hospital visits, ordered by BM25's interpretation of our query representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Re-ranking</head><p>Although our initial Lucene retrieval performs reasonably well for the purpose of ranking documents strictly within respect to keyword relevancy, the queries presented in TREC are characterized by more complex constraints. We address these additional cohort constrains by an iterative re-ranking process: for each constraint identified by the Query Analysis module (patient age, patient gender, hospital status, medical assertion value), we heuristically re-rank all hospital visits for a given question. After each constraint has been considered, the final ranking of patient hospital visits is returned as the solution of our system. What follows is a description of each heuristic re-ranking sub-module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Re-Ranking by the Patient's Age</head><p>The current ranked list of hospital visits are re-ranked with respect to patient age by comparing the frequencies of de-identified patient age information within all the reports associated with each hospital visit. Any hospital visit wherein the number of de-identified age mentions falling outside the numerical range identified by the Query Analysis module (described in section 3.2) has its score lowered by 100 where a hospital visit's score is based on the BM25 score described in section 6; any hospital visit lacking any age information has its score lowered by 50 (so that hospital visits that match the desired criteria are elevated to the top).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Re-Ranking by the Patient's Gender</head><p>When considering the patient's gender, we utilize the same lexicons described in section 3.4 and compare the frequency of Male to Female words in all EMRs associated with a given hospital visit. Hospital visits for which there are more mentions of the opposite gender across all associated EMRs have their current score lowered by 100 (where score is the BM25 score detailed in section 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Re-Ranking according to Assertion Information</head><p>As described in section 3.1, each keyword in a given query is associated with a given medical assertion. For the purposes of re-ranking, we attempted to ascertain the degree to which mentions of a given keyword correctly indicate an actually present medical condition, treatment, or test as opposed to an absent or unsure mention. To accomplish this, we assigned the following negativity value to each possible assertion value: Absent = 1.0, Associated with Someone Else = 1.0, Conditional = 0.333, Conducted = 0, Historical = 0.5, Hypothetical = 0.333, Ongoing = 0, Ordered = 0, Possible = 0.333, Prescribed = 0, Present = 0, and Suggested = 0.333. For each keyword mention in all EMRs associated with a given hospital visit, we calculate the sum of the heuristic value. If this sum is more than one-third of the frequency of keyword mentions for a given keyword, we subtract 400 from the current score (where score is the BM25 score illustrated in section 6) such that if multiple keywords satisfy this criteria the score may be lowered multiple times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Re-Ranking based on the Patient's Hospital Status</head><p>The goal of the hospital status re-ranker is to promote hospital visits wherein at least one EMR that matches a keyword also satisfies the requirements of the patients hospital status detected in section 3.3. In order to achieve this, we consider the meta-data associated with each EMR (the type and subtype fields which indicate the type of each electronic medical report), as well as context for each keyword match: the previous section header, based on a simple section detection algorithm that looks for the last fully capitalized sentence ending with a colon (e.g. DISCHARGE SUM-MARY:), and the lemmatized sentence containing the given keyword. For example, when detecting hospital visits that satisfy patient admission criteria, we look for EMRs that have the subtype of admission, or keywords that fall within a section whose header contains ADMISSION or ADMITTING or whose lemmatized sentence contains admit for, admit to the hospital for, or present to the hospital. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Performance Evaluation</head><p>We provided four submissions to NIST for TREC 2012. UTDHLTA represents our system as described with no modifications, UTDHLTNA represents our system wherein only strict negations are considered when re-ranking for assertions (that is, only Absent or Associated with Someone Else). UTDHLTASK denotes a modification to our system wherein during keyword extraction, keywords may only be decomposed once (shallow decomposition). UTDHLT-NASK denotes a version of our system wherein both strict negations and shallow keyword decomposition are enforced.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Discussion</head><p>It is clear from this table that UTDHLTNA was our best performing submission according to the primary metric of this task, inferred average precision. UT-DHLTA closely follows it in performance, and the performance difference is small enough that, presumably, the naïve heuristic is at fault. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,489.91,498.13,4.88,8.74" target="#tab_4">7</ref> shows the impact of adding each re-ranking method of our reranking module to the overall score. It is to be noted that the results obtained when all re-ranking methods have been applied are different than the results of the UTDHLTA system submitted, which is due to small bug fixes. However, it is clear that incorporating assertion information yielded significant improvement in ranking.</p><p>Assertions encode an incredible amount of semantics from the underlying text, and properly utilizing this information could be of great value to any retrieval system capable of utilizing this knowledge. Future work would benefit from learning weights and using a principled approach to incorporating assertion information into their information retrieval systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusion</head><p>The 2012 Text REtrieval conference marks the second year of the Medical Records Track which begun in 2011. This track sponsors the task of retrieving ranked electronic medical records, grouped by patients' hospital visit, and ranked according to the visit's relevance to a given query. The queries in this task targeted patient cohorts, typically characterized by specific medical treatments, conditions, or tests, as well as specific patient constraints.</p><p>We approached this task by extracting the constraints encoded by a given cohort (patient's age, patient's gender, patient's hospitalization status, and keyword assertion status) and the keywords that encode any medical phenomena found in the query. These keywords were recursively decomposed and then expanded using knowledge from UMLS, SNOMED, and Wikipedia, as well as PubMed Central cooccurrence information. We then perform retrieval to achieve an initial ranking of hospital visits (based on a BM25 relevance model of an interpolation of all decomposed keywords and their associated expansions). Finally, using the constraints extracted earlier, we iteratively re-rank the set of hospital visits for each constraint until we achieve our final ranking.</p><p>The incorporation of assertion status (existence, absence or uncertainty) of a medical condition represents an important step towards truly understanding the semantics behind what is actually being said in a given electronic medical record and could play an integral role in future retrieval systems working in the medical domain. Utilizing this knowledge, however, leaves much room for future work as the complexity involved is nontrivial.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,321.29,594.07,207.28,8.74;2,310.61,194.74,228.64,384.22"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Architecture of Cohort Shepherd</figDesc><graphic coords="2,310.61,194.74,228.64,384.22" type="bitmap" /></figure>
