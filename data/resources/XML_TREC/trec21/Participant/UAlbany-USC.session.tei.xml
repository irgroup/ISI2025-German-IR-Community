<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Research in Information Retrieval has noticed that it is often the case that in a search process, users begin an interaction with a sufficiently under-specified query and they will need to reformulate their query multiple times before they find desired information. In terms of this, researchers hypothesized that a search engine may be able to better serve a user "by ranking results that help "point the way" to what the user is really looking for, or by complementing results from previous queries in the sequence with new results, or in other currentlyunanticipated ways." <ref type="bibr" coords="1,170.86,333.55,280.03,10.50" target="#b1">(Kanoulas, Carterettey, Hallz, Cloughx, &amp; Sanderson, 2011)</ref>. In 2012, the goal of session track is: (G1) to test whether system performance can be improved for a given query by using previous queries and user interactions with the system (including clicks on ranked results, dwell times, etc.), and (G2) to evaluate system performance over an entire query session instead of a single query. Our UAlbany and USC group joined the Session Track task by taking into account searcher behaviors during the course of their information seeking process. In the following, we give an overview of our approach, details of our submission runs, our results, and our conclusions about the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method: the prediction models, queries, and runs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">RL1-Baseline</head><p>For the baseline, we used pseudo relevance feedback built on the current query, i.e., the last query in a session. We used the default parameters in Indri. This method was used by TREC 2011 session track participants such as Rutgers University <ref type="bibr" coords="1,344.97,541.87,76.61,10.50" target="#b3">(Liu et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The following describes the specific parameters:</p><p>&lt;fbDocs&gt;10&lt;/fbDocs&gt; &lt;fbTerms&gt;10&lt;/fbTerms&gt; &lt;fbOrigWeight&gt;0.5&lt;/fbOrigWeight&gt; &lt;fbMu&gt;0&lt;/fbMu&gt; After generating the queries, the symbols like "." in an URL and "'" in "Newton's law" were manually converted to 64 based string because the search engine did not recognize them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">RL2-queries</head><p>Our RL2 considered all queries in the current session. We used the findings in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.92,108.55,75.85,10.50" target="#b2">Liu et al. (2010)</ref> about the performance of query reformulation type to determine if a reformulated query was good or not. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,129.67,139.39,75.91,10.50" target="#b2">Liu et al. (2010)</ref> had different query formulation types, as described in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,491.11,139.39,4.39,10.50" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. It was found that Generalization did not lead to useful pages, therefore, in our current approach, those reformulation type being Generalization was treated as "bad" queries, and all others being "good" queries. In our approach, the adjacent two queries were compared and good queries were picked. The first query was always taken as good. All the good queries were used to expand the current query. Again, some symbols were converted to 64 based format manually and pseudo relevant feedback was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">RL3</head><p>The RL3 run considered all queries issued and webpages viewed in the current session. Determining if a query is "good" or not followed the same way as was done in the RL2 run. For the viewed webpages, our approach was to treat those whose titles match the query non-stop terms as "good" pages; otherwise, bad pages. We also treated Wikipedia pages as good ones.</p><p>In the run, firstly good queries were picked based on the same criteria used in RL2. Then the results of the good queries were examined. If the title of the result page matched the query nonstop terms, the page was taken as good page. Wikipedia pages were taken as good pages. The titles of the good pages and the queries of the good queries were used to expand the current query. Some symbols were converted to 64 based format manually and pseudo relevant feedback was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">RL4</head><p>The RL4 run considered queries issued, webpages viewed, as well the users' interaction behaviors. The query and webpage approaches were the same as described above in the RL3 run.</p><p>For other variables and criteria used, we referred to <ref type="bibr" coords="3,312.31,257.17,78.20,10.50" target="#b0">Agichtein (2006)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, good queries were picked. Then clicked results of the good queries were examined.</p><p>If the title, URL and snippet of the clicked result all matched the query non-stop terms, the result page was considered as a good page candidate. The time spent on the adjacent three good page candidates was compared and the page with the longest dwell time was picked as a good page. If a good query did not have clicked result, the method in RL2 was used to pick good pages. The current query was expanded accordingly. Some symbols were manually converted to 64 based and pseudo relevant feedback was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mean of our results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,99.50,447.01,5.84,10.50" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,161.47,447.01,5.84,10.50">1</ref> show the means of various evaluation measures of the 96 tasks for all our 4 runs. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,125.66,462.43,5.84,10.50">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,187.91,462.43,5.84,10.50">2</ref> show the means of various measures of the 48 topics for all our 4 runs.</p><p>In general, as can be seen, across various measures, RL2 was roughly the same as RL1, RL3 was the best out of all our 4 runs, and RL4 was slightly better than RL1 and RL2, but not as well as RL3.</p><p>We found that the measures for 98 tasks had very similar patterns with the 48 topics. So in the following analysis, we used the 98 tasks only.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Changes over baseline run RL1</head><p>We further examined the changes (improvement/decrease) of our models over our baseline RL1.</p><p>We used ERR (Expected Reciprocal Rank), ndcg@10, and precision@10 for evaluation of our results. ERR was selected because it was based on the "cascade" user model, ndcg@10 because it is the "basic" evaluation measure for the track, and precision@10 was used because it was a frequently used measure with direct evaluation of how the system does in its 1 st SERP. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,507.33,195.43,5.84,10.50" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results.</p><p>As can be seen, RL3 and RL4 outperformed our baseline in all measures. RL2 improved in Err and precision@10 but not nDCG@10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Comparison between RL2, RL3, and RL4</head><p>We also compared the performance of all our models, RL2, RL3, and RL4. Again, we used err, ndcg@10, and precision@10 in this comparison. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,330.36,444.25,5.84,10.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the results.</p><p>As can be seen, RL3 improved much than RL2, with 25.1% in Err measure, 36.2% in nDCG@10, and 44.2% in precision@10. RL4 also improved over RL2, and the ratio was 6.5% in Err, 8.9 in nDCG@10, and 3.0% in precision@10. A direct comparison of RL4 over RL3 received unsurprising decrease in all 3 measures, dropping 14.9% in Err, 20.1% in nDCG@10, and 28.6% in precision@10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion/Conclusions</head><p>In our baseline, based on standard Indri techniques, we used pseudo relevance feedback built on the current query, i.e., the last query in a session. For the experimental runs, we used the findings in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,82.08,189.73,75.74,10.50" target="#b2">Liu et al. (2010)</ref> about the performance of query reformulation type to determine good queries in RL2, and then used the comparison between titles of viewed webpages and their queries to determine the good webpages in RL3. In RL4, we adopted the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,455.55,220.57,46.07,10.50;6,70.02,236.05,31.09,10.50" target="#b0">Agichtein (2006)</ref> to fully take into account issued queries, viewed webpages and the users' interaction behaviors. We discovered that, in general, and evaluated by ERR, ndcg@10, and precision@10, RL3 run performed best than the other three runs. Our RL4 run was better than RL2 run in terms of err, and precision@10, but not for the rest of the measures. The results may be attributed to the various task features and types since the RL3 run identified a good webpage if there was a match between the title and the query.</p><p>In the future, we plan to further explore the relationship between the task types, task difficulties, domain types, and users' search behavior, as well as the appropriate or better ways of computing the usefulness scores for each webpage.</p></div>
