<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper we present the combined submission of the teams NICTA and UBC, which focuses on query expansion techniques. For this edition we build upon the NICTA-2011 systems <ref type="bibr" coords="1,121.80,437.48,10.91,10.91" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, and we incorporate the Personalised PageRank algorithm in order to select the most similar concepts to the query terms, and then use them for query expansion.</p><p>The NICTA system was ranked 6th on the 2011 Medical Track (with regards to the Bpref measure). We did minimal changes to this knowledge-based query expansion method, and centered our efforts in combining this technique with a graph-based expansion approach from the UBC team, namely Personalised PageRank.</p><p>Personalized PageRank <ref type="bibr" coords="1,215.28,518.72,11.54,10.91" target="#b6">[6]</ref> has been successfully used in Natural Language Processing tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,284.16,532.28,11.42,10.91" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,299.16,532.28,8.54,10.91" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,311.28,532.28,8.42,10.91" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,323.28,532.28,13.94,10.91" target="#b11">11]</ref> and word similarity <ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.40,532.28,11.42,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,452.40,532.28,7.69,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>. It has been applied both to a general purpose lexical knowledge-base such as WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.88,545.84,11.54,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,465.84,545.84,8.42,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,478.68,545.84,8.42,10.91" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,491.52,545.84,8.54,10.91" target="#b4">4]</ref> and also to UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="1,151.08,559.40,11.54,10.91" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,166.32,559.40,12.71,10.91" target="#b11">11]</ref>. In addition, recent results show that it is useful to improve ad-hoc IR with WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="1,153.72,572.96,10.91,10.91" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. In this work, we apply it on UMLS in order to improve results over the TREC task.</p><p>Our final scores show that query expansion is beneficial over the baseline methods; specially over the TREC-2011 queries, where it reaches the performance of the best 2011 systems. For the TREC-2012 query-set the results were far from the best performing system, but above the median of the submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Method</head><p>We present here the steps of our approach: we start by describing how we processed the TREC document collection; then we explain our query processing method, including the expansion techniques; finally we detail our indexing and searching approaches. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Processing the Document Collection</head><p>We apply the same pipeline as in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.72,307.04,11.42,10.91" target="#b8">[8]</ref> for processing the document collection. We start by expanding the mentions of ICD9 codes<ref type="foot" coords="2,262.56,319.01,4.23,7.68" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of admission and discharge diagnoses in the metadata with their text descriptions. Both the original code and expanded forms were included for indexing.</p><p>The documents contain different sections, with their corresponding headings. We rely on hand-crafted pattern-matching rules to identify the main headings, in order to build different indices and allow for field-based search. The list of the fields we cover is given in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,480.84,388.28,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Apart from these fields, we built rules to identify and normalise some demographic information, such as gender, age, and other specific conditions (such as weight) mentioned in the text.</p><p>We also ran NegEx<ref type="foot" coords="2,188.52,427.49,4.23,7.68" target="#foot_1">2</ref> over the entire collection in order to detect negated phrases. We rely on the in-built NegEx parser of MetaMap-2010, which specifies which of the identified phrases appear to be negated. We use this information to build an index that converts negated terms that are majority in a given document, into a new representation, where the negated phrase is transformed into a single word, with no space, and with a "no" prefix: e.g., if negation is implied for "chronic back pain", all instances of "chronic back pain" are replaced with the word "nochronicbackpain". Our aim with this index is to avoid matching cases where the term appears negated in the document more often than as positive. Due to the lack of negated queries in the collections, the result of transforming words is the same as removing them.</p><p>Finally, we indexed the collection with and without the Porter stemmer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Processing Queries</head><p>We describe first our methods to identify fields in the query, and then our different expansion approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Identifying Fields in the Query</head><p>We developed a set of manually constructed patterns to map query terms into the available fields (   Abbreviation seen in the er|presented to the er REPORT:("emergency room" OR ER)</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,110.88,453.32,4.21,10.91">2</ref>: Rules (patterns in the queries and their translations) used in the query transformation step. Words that are all in capital letters are field names.</p><p>weight (using body mass index), diagnostics, treatments, medications, history, allergies, and abbreviations. For example, if a query contained "elderly patients", we expanded "elderly" with an equivalent age field that covered people in their 60s to 90+. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,433.56,536.24,5.45,10.91">2</ref> shows the details of the selected transformation rules. For example the query:</p><p>Elderly patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia is translated to:</p><p>PRESTHIS:(ventilator associated pneumonia) OR DISCHDIAG:(ventilator associated pneumonia) OR AGE:(age60 age70 age80 age90) OR REPORT:(elderly with ventilator associated pneumonia).</p><p>A small number of abbreviations, such as ER (emergency room), were also expanded in the queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Query Expansion using Semantic Types (ST)</head><p>We leveraged external resources to add new terms to our queries, by identifying terms that are strongly related to the query terms. Specifically, we focused on query terms that represent medical categorical concepts (e.g. disease categories). For example, for the query below, we added terms falling under the category of "atypical antipsychotics":</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients taking atypical antipsychotics</head><p>Our approach to expansion used two main knowledge sources: the UMLS Metathesaurus (version 2010aa) and DBpedia. In order to select expansion candidates we used MetaMap-2010 from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). We defined manual expansion rules from these resources based on the sample queries of TREC-2011 and 50 queries from the priority list from the US Institute of Medicine of the National Academies <ref type="foot" coords="4,391.32,222.53,4.23,7.68" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>Using these queries, we defined a small set of stop-categories that would have otherwise produced undesirable expansions. The following terms were excluded from expansion: "administration", "AMA", "diagnosis", "drug", "functional concept", "medication", and "surgery". We also removed terms with the following strings from the DBpedia output: "code", "history", "mechanism", "poisoning", "toxicity", and "withdrawal".</p><p>During the development process, we explored expansion using hierarchical relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus, by selecting all the terms in the hyponym concepts; however, we observed that DBpedia offered a higher coverage of some domains, such as newly developed drugs, and it also showed less risk of over-expansion. For instance, one sample query contained the term "atypical antipshychotic", which UMLS expanded with 8 more specific drugs (e.g. "Clozapine"). DBpedia, however, identified the same set of drugs, as well as a further 22 new drug and brand names, which seemed correct after manual analysis, and had a stronger presence in the collection.</p><p>For our final expansion system, we first applied MetaMap to identify phrases linked to terms in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The matched concepts were then used as candidate terms to be expanded; in some cases terms consisted of a primary term followed by a parenthesized description -such as "Intervention (Surgical and medical procedures)" -and in such cases we treated them as separate candidate terms.</p><p>Each candidate term had a Semantic Type (ST) associated with it in the MetaMap output. We used STs to define two expansion groups: safe expansion (for terms which STs include the string "Pharmacologic Substance") and filtered expansion (for terms whose ST is "Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure"). Candidate terms that did not belong to these groups were discarded; for the rest, if they were listed as "category" in DBpedia <ref type="foot" coords="4,424.08,534.17,4.23,7.68" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , we extracted all of the terms listed under the category as our expansion terms. Then, for "safe expansion" the output was the full list of expansion terms; for "filtered expansion", we removed terms which are not UMLS concepts by applying MetaMap to each term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Query Expansion using Personalised PageRank</head><p>For this approach, we use a graph algorithm based on random walks over the graph representation of a knowledge-base of concepts and relations, to obtain concepts related to the queries. The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base, and we represent UMLS as a graph.</p><p>Apart from concepts, UMLS Metathesaurus also contains a wide range of information about the relations between concepts in the form of database tables. The MRREL table lists relations between concepts like "parent", "can be qualified by" or "related and possibly synonymous" among others. The MRCOC table contains co-occurrence relations between concepts, that is, relations between similar concepts or different concepts that share an important connection. In order to obtain the graph structure of UMLS, we simply treat the concepts in UMLS as vertices, and the relations listed in the MRREL and MRCOC tables as edges. No weights are used for the relations that are extracted from the MRREL table.</p><p>Given a query and the graph-based representation of UMLS, we obtain a ranked list of related concepts as follows:</p><p>1. We first run MetaMap and identify the UMLS concepts in the query, we explore two variants: with and without the in-built Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) module.</p><p>We also rely on the NegEx module to remove negated concepts. Note that in cases where we rely on field search, we treat each field as a separate query for this kind of expansion.</p><p>2. We then assign a uniform probability distribution to the concepts found in the query.</p><p>The rest of nodes are initialized to zero.</p><p>3. We compute personalized PageRank <ref type="bibr" coords="5,284.88,341.84,11.54,10.91" target="#b6">[6]</ref> over the graph, using the previous distribution as the initial distribution, and we produce a probability distribution over UMLS concepts. The higher the probability for a concept, the more related it is to the given text.</p><p>Basically, personalized PageRank is computed by modifying the random jump distribution vector in the traditional PageRank equation. In our case, we concentrate all probability mass in the concepts identified in the query.</p><p>Let G be a graph with N vertices v 1 , . . . , v N and d i be the outdegree of node i; let M be a N × N transition probability matrix, where M ji = 1 d i if a link from i to j exists, and zero otherwise. Then, the calculation of the PageRank vector Pr over G is equivalent to resolving Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,128.16,486.32,12.62,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,245.88,499.88,276.03,10.91">Pr = cM Pr + (1 -c)v<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In the equation, v is a N × 1 vector and c is the so-called damping factor, a scalar value between 0 and 1. The first term of the sum on the equation models the voting scheme described in the beginning of the section. The second term represents, loosely speaking, the probability of a surfer randomly jumping to any node, e.g. without following any paths on the graph. The damping factor, usually set in the [0.85..0.95] range, models the way in which these two terms are combined at each step.</p><p>The second term on Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,220.13,601.16,4.61,10.91" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) can also be seen as a smoothing factor that makes any graph fulfill the property of being aperiodic and irreducible, and thus guarantees that the PageRank calculation converges to a unique stationary distribution.</p><p>In the traditional PageRank formulation the vector v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all 1  N , thus assigning equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in case of random jumps. In the case of personalized PageRank as used here, v is initialized with uniform probabilities for the concepts in the query, and 0 for the rest of terms.</p><p>PageRank is actually calculated by applying an iterative algorithm which computes Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,512.69,696.08,4.61,10.91" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) successively until a fixed number of iterations are executed. In our case, we used a publicly available implementation <ref type="foot" coords="6,200.16,110.33,4.23,7.68" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , with the default values provided by the software, i.e. a damping value of 0.95, and 30 iterations.</p><p>In order to select the expansion terms from the ranking of concepts, we use a threshold value to retrieve the top concepts, and then we obtain all the terms that appear under each concept in the UMLS Metathesaurus. We explored two approaches to determine the cut-off value: (i) select the top k concepts, or (ii) select all the concepts with weights above a given t threshold. Our preliminary experiments over the TREC-2011 dataset suggested that the former approach was able to provide better performances for different settings, and we decided to use the top k concepts for our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Combined Query Expansion</head><p>In order to combine our two different expansion techniques, we can simply merge the terms from each expansion source into a joint query. Another approach that we explored is to rely on the expanded terms from the ST-expansion to initialise the PageRank method. We report the results of the two methods in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Indexing and Searching</head><p>We first distinguish between two types of indexing in our runs: visit-based and report-based. In the former approach, all related reports for a visit were concatenated (removing duplicate diagnostics codes) to create a single "multi-document" item for indexing. We refer to the former approach as VISIT, and as REPORT to the latter.</p><p>As explained in Section 2.1, we also generate different indexes depending on the use of separate fields or not (FIELDS/COMBINED), or the application of stemming (STEM/NOSTEM). When we rely on field search, a Boolean search over the fields is followed by ranking.</p><p>We used stop-word removal both in query processing and indexing; however, we augmented the typical list of stop-words with patient, and removed single characters, and, or, not, and no from the list.</p><p>Regarding negation, as explained in Section 2.1, we pre-processed the document collection with NegEx, in order to to handle negated terms, and built separate indices. Since we only observed minor differences, we settled on a single index for each of the collections. Thus, we report here the results using the NegEx-processed index for TREC-2011, and the full index for TREC-2012.</p><p>The search engine used for indexing and searching in our runs was Apache Lucene (v3.2); we used both the BM25 and tf-idf ranking algorithms for Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="6,394.32,576.80,15.95,10.91" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results over the TREC-2011 query set</head><p>We first tested different combinations of our main approaches over the TREC-2011 query set and collection, in order to select the most promising configurations for TREC-2012. We relied on the same evaluation metric that was used in TREC-2011: Bpref.</p><p>We performed three main experiments: • Combine ST expansion and PageRank, without field indexing</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,97.32,704.54,5.45,8.08">•</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Combine ST expansion and PageRank, with field indexing</head><p>As mentioned above, when we combine PageRank and ST, we have to choose if we want to apply PageRank over the query concepts, or over the ST-expanded concept set. We present the results for the two different settings in most of our experiments. There are other two alternatives when applying PageRank: to perform WSD prior to choosing the initial concepts, or not to use WSD. We report here the results of the two variants. Finally, we also need to set a threshold to decide the number of top concepts to use. As mentioned above, we performed preliminary experiments using two types of thresholds: weight-based (i.e. choose all the concepts above the cut-off PageRank weight) and ranking-based (i.e. select all the concepts in the top k positions), and settled on the latter setting. We report the results for the best and worst cut-offs in the range 3-20 over the TREC-2011 dataset.</p><p>We start our analysis by evaluating the performance of PageRank without ST expansions. In this case we also need to decide whether we parse the query before applying PageRank or not. For our first experiment we chose the index VISIT+STEM+COMBINED and TF-IDF ranking as basic system, since it achieved the highest performance in previous experiments when no ST expansions were used.</p><p>The results over the TREC-2011 query set are given in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,398.04,680.84,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, together with the basic system without PageRank. We can see that the system achieves its best performances when applying PageRank first, and that we are able to improve over the baseline. WSD does not seem to be helpful, and starting with all the concepts from MetaMap (not only the disambiguated ones) is the best strategy for this experiment. Next we performed a similar experiment by using report indexing (instead of visits), and no stemming; we chose this indexing because it was also competitive, and we observed clear differences over the outputs of these settings in previous experiments. We present the results of this experiment in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,248.88,497.72,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. We can see that the results are similar to the previous experiment, and we also observe an increase in the best Bpref value.</p><p>For our next experiment we combine the ST expansion with PageRank. As base configuration, we rely on the same index and ranking used in the previous test (VISIT+STEM+COMBINED and TF-IDF). The results of this experiment are given in Table 5. There is a larger improvement over the baseline in this case, and even the worst thresholds improve the baseline when PageRank is applied first. Note that the best results are similar to the best official submission for the TREC 2011 challenge. Again, the best performance is achieved without WSD.</p><p>We also apply the alternative baseline system of report indexing and no stemming for the combined system. We present the results of this experiment in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,416.16,633.32,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. These results reach the highest Bpref score so far, and are more robust regarding the lower bounds. Again, the best strategy is to apply PageRank first, and not to use WSD in the process.</p><p>We then explore the use of fields in the indexing. This approach obtained worse performance that combining fields in our previous experiments, and we only perform two runs, always applying PageRank first. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,387.24,701.00,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_8">7</ref>. We can see that the gains are smaller than in previous configurations, and there is a big drop in the case of the worst threshold.  We summarise the best results of our systems over the TREC-2011 dataset in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,513.48,412.52,4.21,10.91" target="#tab_9">8</ref>. We observe that PageRank expansion helps to improve the baseline, and that the best performance is obtained when combining it with ST, even if ST alone does not perform well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System</head><p>4 Official results over the TREC-2012 query set At the time of submitting the runs, we did not have all the information regarding the optimal values of combinations and parameters, so we chose four configurations that had achieved good performance over the TREC-2011 dataset at the time. For all our runs, we relied on the COMBINED index (since FIELDS did not perform well over TREC-2011), and we did not process negations for the documents (only for the queries), we also use TF-IDF in all the submitted runs:  Table <ref type="table" coords="10,112.32,336.92,9.21,10.91" target="#tab_0">10</ref>: Results over TREC-2012 using the best parametrization for each technique, as attested in TREC-2011.</p><p>system, scoring well above the median for all metrics. This means that we obtained the best performance when we relying on ST expansion alone, and unlike our TREC-2011 experiments, combining ST and PageRank did not help.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Additional experiments</head><p>After the qrels were released, we already had obtained the complete set of results on TREC 2011, and we performed additional experiments. We first checked the performance of the best 2011 configurations (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,454.68,506.24,4.82,10.91" target="#tab_9">8</ref>) on the 2012 data. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,139.80,519.80,10.85,10.91" target="#tab_0">10</ref> shows those results, with both PageRank and ST improving over the baseline system, confirming that they are successful strategies for expansion. For TREC-2012, ST seems to be the best strategy, and surprisingly, the combination of ST and PageRank does not perform so well.</p><p>Alternatively, we also wanted to check the results of the algorithms when the parameters and combinations are optimized using TREC-2012 as development, and TREC-2011 as the test dataset. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,174.12,601.04,10.85,10.91" target="#tab_0">11</ref> shows the the optimal configurations and performances for each of the types of expansions that we tested over the TREC-2012 dataset. We observe that PageRank is able to match ST's performance, given the optimal setting, and the best results are obtained combining both, except for infNCDG, which reports the best results for ST.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="10,128.40,655.28,10.85,10.91" target="#tab_13">12</ref> reports the results on the TREC-2011 dataset, when the parameters are those obtained in the optimisation over TREC-2012. Note that Bpref is the only measure available on the 2011 data. The results confirm that both expansion strategies (PageRank and ST) are useful, with the best results obtained with PageRank, and the combination yielding the best results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This year We have tested two different methods for query expansion based on DbPedia and UMLS. The first method is heuristic query expansion, and the second is based on random walks over UMLS. Our development experiments on TREC-2011 showed that our heuristic and random-walk expansion algorithms (ST and PageRank, respectively) where very successful, with PageRank providing better results and the combination beating the best reported results.</p><p>When submitting the runs to TREC-2012 our development experiments where not completely finished. Our best run was based on ST expansion alone, and ranked 11th out of the 82 automatic runs. When development finished we were able to improve the PageRank results, and show that both PageRank and ST were improving performance over our baseline system. The best results were those of ST expansion, as submitted to the official task.</p><p>In addition, we also report the results when optimizing parameters on the 2012 dataset and evaluating on 2011. The results confirm that both expansion strategies overcome the baseline, with PageRank performing better than ST, and the combination providing the best results. In the future, we plan to perform a thorough analysis of the different queries, in order to learn the reasons for the discrepancy between 2011 and 2012 dataset, and to explore better ways to develop expansion techniques that benefit from the combined expansion approach over medical data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,97.32,590.12,369.23,10.91;9,108.24,603.68,86.43,10.91;9,97.32,625.88,385.67,10.91;9,108.24,639.32,103.11,10.91;9,97.32,661.52,253.71,10.91;9,97.32,683.60,385.67,10.91;9,108.24,697.16,86.79,10.91;9,97.92,721.40,231.89,10.91"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>NICTAUBC1: Combined expansion, PageRank first (threshold = 3), index REPORT+STEM • NICTAUBC2: Combined expansion, ST expansion first (threshold = 4), index REPORT+NOSTEM • NICTAUBC4: ST expansion, index VISIT+STEM • NICTAUBC6: Combined expansion, ST expansion first (threshold = 6), index VISIT+NOSTEM The results of the different systems are given in</figDesc></figure>
