<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC) is a multi-disciplinary research facility applying information and communication technology to improve health services and clinical treatment. The Health Data Semantic group aims to improve access for health data by combining statistical approaches in information retrieval and natural language processing with the formal semantics of the SNOMED CT medical ontology.</p><p>Our system used for the TREC Medical Records Track uses concept-based information retrieval models and medical domain knowledge provided by the SNOMED CT ontology; the system builds up from our experience at the 2011 Medical Records Track <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.30,166.57,10.91,9.57" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In conceptbased IR both documents and queries are represented using semantic concepts rather than keywords, retrieval is performed within this concept space. Using high-level concepts makes the retrieval model less dependent on the specific terms being used; this is done to address the problem of vocabulary mismatch. Queries and documents are transformed from their original terms to SNOMED CT concepts, retrieval is then performed by matching concepts. Concept-based approaches have previously demonstrated excellent results -Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,505.03,247.86,16.97,9.57" target="#b9">[10]</ref> concept-based system (using concept from UMLS ontology and MeSH headings) was the top performing at the TREC Geonomics Track.</p><p>We further investigate the use of relationship between concepts explicitly defined in the SNOMED CT ontology. Firstly, we utilise the parent-child ('is-a') relationship to weight concepts in a document that are children or subsumed by the query concepts. This is done to address the problem of granularity mismatch -where the concepts found in the documents are very detailed and specific, while those in the query are more general and high-level. The incorporation of subsumed concepts into the retrieval model had previously shown improvement in retrieval performance, as shown by Zuccon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,384.76,369.80,16.00,9.57" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Finally, besides the is-a relationship, we consider all types of relationships in SNOMED CT to weight concepts that are related to the query concept.</p><p>Results show that the concept-based system alone performed well above the median (+26% infAP). The inclusion of subsumed concepts via SNOMED CT is-a relationships demonstrated some additional improvements in performance. The inclusion of other SNOMED CT relationships demonstrated mixed results and require further investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Concept-based Information Retrieval</head><p>In our system all queries and documents are converted from the original term-based representation into medical concepts. For this purpose we used MetaMap, which has been widely adopted in medical NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.40,557.92,11.52,9.57" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.51,557.92,8.49,9.57" target="#b6">7]</ref> and medical IR <ref type="bibr" coords="2,314.24,557.92,11.52,9.57" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.34,557.92,8.49,9.57" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.42,557.92,7.68,9.57" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The advantage of using concepts (rather than just terms) is that different terms with the same meaning are mapped to the same concept -for example the input text 'Myocardial Infarction' and 'Heart Attack' will both map to the same UMLS concept. Conversion to concepts aims to overcome some of the vocabulary mismatch that exists in medical text.</p><p>We represented both documents and queries not as bag-of-words but as bag-of-concepts. The overall process to translate from terms to concepts is as follows:</p><p>1. Original queries and documents are fed to the MetaMap. MetaMap identifies medical concepts using the UMLS ontology and returns their corresponding UMLS concept ids. Each document and query is now represented as a list of UMLS concept ids (e.g. C0027051) rather than the original terms (e.g. heart attack). Documents now only contain medical concepts.</p><p>2. The UMLS concepts are then mapped to their SNOMED CT equivalents. This mapping is provided as part of the UMLS Metathesaurus. Queries and documents are now represented as a list of SNOMED CT concept ids.</p><p>3. Documents are indexed using the Indri Lemur search engine. The system treats the documents as a bag-of-concepts.</p><p>4. The queries (represented as SNOMED CT concept ids) are issued to the retrieval engine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>A ranked list of document results is returned. The concept-based representations are considerably longer than the original term-based documents. This is a result of including all the candidate concepts suggested by the MetaMap program, not just those top-ranked concepts. Without candidate concepts the SNOMED CT average document length was 1391 concepts / document, considerably smaller than the termbased 2338 terms per document. Later experimental results show that retrieval performance is improved by including all candidate concepts rather than just choosing the top-ranked concepts suggested by MetaMap. Including candidates could be considered a type of basic query expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Incorporation of SNOMED CT relationships</head><p>In this section we describe our methods for extending the concept-based approach with the inclusion of SNOMED CT relationships. This approach includes in the weighting function not just the query concepts appearing in the document, but also the concept related to the query concepts that appear in the document. Documents are scored according to (1) the weight of query concepts in a document, and (2) the weight of concepts in a document that are related to a query concept. For each query concept c i we obtain the list of related concepts c j c i from the SNOMED CT ontology. These subsumed concepts are included in the retrieval function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,191.48,725.51,330.52,22.06">RSV (d|q) = c i ∈q w(c i , d) + c j c i ;c i ∈q δ(w(c j , d))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where w(c i , d) is the weight of concept c i in document d, and δ(w(c j , d)) adjusts the weight of a related concept c j . That is, the score of a document for a query q is the sum of the weights associated with the query concepts and the adjusted weights of the concepts that are related to the query concepts. Equation 1 is a general method to integrate subsumed concepts into the retrieval function. A number of instantiations of both w(c i , d) and δ(w(c j , d)) are possible. In this instance we used the enhanced tf-idf described by Zhai <ref type="bibr" coords="4,282.04,193.67,11.52,9.57" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in which the Okapi formula is used for weighting term frequencies and where concepts are used instead of terms, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,175.76,228.88,346.24,29.07">w(c i , d) = k 1 count(c i , d) count(c i , d) + k 1 (1 -b + b l d lavg ) • log |D| |d(c i )| (2)</formula><p>where l avg is the average document length, and k 1 , b are the Okapi parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Weighting Subsumed Concepts using IS-A Relationships</head><p>If a concept is subsumed by another concept in the SNOMED CT ontology it indicates it is a child or specialisation of the parent concept. We include subsumed concept weighting into the retrieval function in order to tackle the problem of granularity mismatch -a problem previously identified in medical IR.</p><p>From Equation 1 the related concepts, denoted by c j c i is restricted to only is-a relationship. Thus, we consider how the weight of a concept should be adjusted if it was subsumed by the query. A straightforward approach would be to treat subsumed concepts in the same way as query concepts, i.e. δ(w(c j , d)) = w(c j , d). However, the presence of a subsumed concept in a document may offer a different indication of relevance than an actual query concept. A subsumed concept indicates a specialisation of the parent concept, and thus treated differently to an actual query concept. Intuitively a subsumed concept would be a weaker indication of relevance than a query concept. Thus, the weight for the subsumed concept c j in the document is dampended according to the square root of the weight w(c j , d), i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,246.16,509.37,275.84,10.63">δ(w(c j , d)) = w(c j , d)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In this case a subsumed concept contributes less evidence towards the score of a document than a query concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Inclusion of all SNOMED CT relationships</head><p>The previous section considered weighting of concepts related to the query concept via a is-a relationship, i.e., subsumed concepts. In this section we widen the scope to all types of SNOMED CT relationships. Thus, c j c i from Equation 1 includes all relationships. For the implantation of the weighting adjustment function δ(w(c j , d)) = w(c j , d) we implement a similarity function sim that estimates the similarity between the two concepts c i and c j .</p><p>Instead of dampening using the uniform w(c j , d) applied to subsumed concepts we consider similarities between concepts to modulate weights. A number of different similarity measures are possible. Previous research by Pedersen et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,324.69,694.99,11.52,9.57" target="#b7">[8]</ref> found corpus-driven measures of similarity to be effective in the medical domain. Following the findings of Koopman et al. which evaluated a number of corpus-driven measures <ref type="bibr" coords="4,302.27,722.08,11.50,9.57" target="#b3">[4]</ref> we implement as our similarity measure the cosine angle between the two concepts c i and c j document vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Documents as visits</head><p>The guidelines for the Medical Records Track stated that the unit of retrieval should be a single patient visit. A visit is a single admission for a single patient -if the same patient is admitted on two different occasions these will be viewed as two separate visits. Our approach was to treat individual reports as sub-documents and compile them together with all the other reports pertaining to a single patient admission into a single larger document. The unit of retrieval is then a 'patient visit' rather than individual medical reports. As all reports for a single visit are concatenated together we make no distinction as to the different reports type -radiology, discharge summary, etc. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Concept-based IR contribution</head><p>Results are heavily dependent on the quality of concept extraction provided by the MetaMap system. MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts, which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts. Mapping between terminologies may result in a loss in meaning from the original query or document. Certain UMLS concepts have no equivalent in SNOMED CT, such cases were found in the worst performing queries, e.g. query 178 "Patients with metastatic breast cancer". Nevertheless, our concept-based baseline (AEHRC0) provides consistent improvements over the median of TREC systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Effect of Weighting Concept Relationships</head><p>We now consider the contribution of combining weights of query concepts and related concepts for scoring a document. Empirical results show that considering related concepts along with the original query concepts can improve retrieval effectiveness; which concept relationships to consider and how to weight these is however a challenging issue. Our AEHRC1 and AEHRC2 submission have proved that not all concept relationships lead to improvements of retrieval  effectiveness; while our AEHRCsub submission has shown that subsumption relationships do indeed provide relevant information that ultimately can lead to improvements. In addition, this submission demonstrate that improvements can be obtained by adjusting weights of subsumed concepts via an ad-hoc simple function. However, results obtained using this approach are not consistent throughout the whole query set; the approach itself provides small flexibility and interpretational power. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented approaches to searching electronic medical records based on concept matching rather than keyword matching. Queries and documents are transformed from their termbased originals into medical concepts as defined by the SNOMED CT ontology. Relationships between concepts are also accounted for in our document scoring approaches. Results show our approaches perform reasonably well, above the median value from all TREC systems. Our concept-based approaches that combine concept relationships in the retrieval function provide a platform for further development into inferencing based search systems for dealing with medical data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,218.83,603.51,165.34,9.57"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: InfAP for sub vs median</figDesc></figure>
