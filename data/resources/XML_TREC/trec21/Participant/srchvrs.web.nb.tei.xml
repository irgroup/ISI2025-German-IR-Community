<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Associating anchor text with pages, to which links are pointing, is a well-known approach to improve retrieval quality. It was used in the first version of Google <ref type="bibr" coords="1,126.00,322.72,89.25,8.74" target="#b4">[Brin and Page 1998</ref>]. On one hand, using the anchor text alone allows one to obtain a system with decent performance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,316.75,334.68,102.48,8.74" target="#b0">[Anh and Moffat 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.39,334.68,60.26,8.74;1,126.00,346.63,48.73,8.74" target="#b6">Hiemstra and Hauff 2010]</ref>. We also know that the anchor text is a strong relevance signal from our own experiments in TREC 2011 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,295.11,358.59,117.54,8.74" target="#b3">[Boytsov and Belova 2011]</ref>. On the other hand, the size of the anchor text is much smaller than size of the text for a full collection. Thus, enriching the Category B index (built over 50M documents) with the Category A anchor text index (built over 370M short documents), seemed to be an appealing method of improving performance at little cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Setup</head><p>We used two retrieval engines. One was a system developed for TREC 2011, which included an index for the Category B subset (50M documents). It explicitly indexed posting lists of close word pairs (where at least one word was frequent) and had a large index of 513 Gb. The detailed description of this type of index is given in our 2010 and 2011 reports <ref type="bibr" coords="1,227.81,512.55,116.25,8.74" target="#b2">[Boytsov and Belova 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,348.05,512.55,21.22,8.74">2011]</ref>. There are more than 20 relevance features combined in a semi-linear formula. In TREC 2011, we showed that this system was a strong benchmark: See the run srchvrs11b (Table <ref type="table" coords="1,446.98,536.46,4.43,8.74">2</ref>) in the overview paper by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,208.80,548.42,81.24,8.74" target="#b5">Clarke et al. [2011]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, we built a similar index over the Category A anchor text (Category A anchor text was compiled by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,267.41,572.44,114.75,8.74" target="#b6">Hiemstra and Hauff [2010]</ref>). Unlike the Category B index, it employed only one text field: anchor text. The anchor text index relied on the SpamRank, but not on the PageRank. The number of documents was about 370M. However, each document was small and the size of the index was only 212 Gb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Results</head><p>We tried several approaches to combine scores from two retrieval systems: a linear combination of scores with different dictionaries, a linear combination of scores with the shared dictionary, and a round-robin method. In the approach with the shared • dictionary, we used IDF values only from the Category B dictionary. None of the approaches allowed us to achieve higher performance scores on training data in the ad hoc task. However, we obtained slightly higher values of the diversity metric α-nDCG@20.</p><p>Overall, we submitted three runs srchvrs12c10, srchvrs12c09, and srchvrs12c00, where anchor text scores were summed up with with Category B scores. Prior to aggregating, anchor text scores were multiplied by the scaling coefficients 1, 0.9, and 0 respectively. The last run (srchvrs12c00) represents a "pure" Category B run. It turned out that all three runs had almost identical diversity scores ERR-IA@20, which were approximately equal to 0.38. The ad hoc scores were very similar as well: for example, ERR@20 was approximately equal to 0.305. We see that both srchvrs12c09 and srchvrs12c10 improved in MAP over the pure Category B run srchvrs12c00 (this was a statistically significant improvement that "survived" the Holm-Bonferroni correction). Yet, these improvements were small: 2.3% and 5%, respectively.</p><p>We also compared performance of runs that relied solely on Category A anchor text with performance of Category B runs (same algorithm as for srchvrs12c00). According to Table <ref type="table" coords="2,216.54,420.54,3.18,8.74" target="#tab_0">I</ref>, in 2010-2011 the values of ERR@20 for anchor text runs were only slightly higher than 1/2 of ERR@20 scores for the respective Category B runs. In 2012, however, the anchor text run had almost 4x weaker performance compared to the Category B run. This may partially explain the fact that combining anchor text runs and Category B runs did not lead to noticeable improvement in performance.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated an effect of not using SpamRank in 2010, 2011, and 2012. To do this, we set the SpamRank factor to 1 (it is included multiplicatively). We found that 2010 was the only year in which the SpamRank improved ERR@20 scores of our method. This is in contrast with our 2010 observation that SpamRanks can improve performance scores by a large margin <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.67,540.30,111.90,8.74" target="#b2">[Boytsov and Belova 2010]</ref>. Perhaps, a more advanced system, which, among other factors, includes anchor text, is more robust to spam. It may also indicate that embedding a good relevance feature into an already strong baseline does not necessarily lead to a performance boost <ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.00,588.12,95.40,8.74" target="#b1">[Armstrong et al. 2009</ref>].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We merged results obtained from the Category B index with results obtained from the index built over complete (Category A) anchor text. Yet, this approach did not lead to a significant improvement in performance. We hypothesize that simple merging approaches (such as linear combinations or round-robin) do not work well</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,126.00,243.38,197.27,108.76"><head>Table I :</head><label>I</label><figDesc>Comparing performance of runs based on Category A anchor text against performance of Category B runs (for different years).</figDesc><table coords="2,131.98,301.53,173.41,50.61"><row><cell>year</cell><cell>2010</cell><cell>2011</cell><cell>2012</cell></row><row><cell>anchor text</cell><cell cols="3">0.056 0.084 0.079</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Category B run 0.106 0.137 0.307</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Scores are computed using ERR@20</cell></row></table></figure>
