<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Any evaluation campaign has a set of criteria that generally fall in one of two categories: effectiveness (does the system do what it was designed to be doing?) and efficiency (how fast/reliable/cheap is it?). While in principle these two categories do not conflict, in practice, because human experts have to be involved in the effectiveness category, it is hard to run one experiment that goes both sufficiently deep in the analysis to assess actual effectiveness in real user context and sufficiently large scale to give a clear image of the scalability of the different systems. This is why we divided our track into two sub-tasks.</p><p>Technical Survey Task : 18 topics have been kindly provided by chemical patent experts based on their information needs. Participants' systems retrieve a ranked list of documents in response to each topic. In order to alleviate the evaluation work for the experts, and compare ordinary users and experts' views on relevant judgements, we carried out a two step evaluation procedure, where each topic is judged by two graduate students majored in chemistry in the first step, then presented to a patent expert for judgements by taking into account the students' judgements in the second step. This task enables us to understand the pros and cons of the participating systems in finding relevant chemical documents and how effectiveness can be improved.</p><p>Prior Art Search Task : The second task asked participating systems to find relevant patents with respect to a set of 1,000 existing patents. The results returned by the systems were not to be manually evaluated, but based on existing citations of the 1,000 patents and their family members. This task also contained a mini-task, where the participants were invited to submit the results to only the first 100 patents in the list. This task was intended to helps us investigate how to design both effective and efficient systems that can retrieve high quality relevant documents for a rather large number of topics.</p><p>The track organizers received registrations from 14 research groups from both academia and industry, who were allowed to download the data and topics. Eventually, 8 groups submitted at least one run to at least one of the two tasks. The methods applied vary substantially, from basic Ir methods (e.g. vector space models without any pre-processing of the text) to advanced chemistry-specific methods using named entity recognition software and synonyms of chemical substances.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the test collection in Section 2, present Prior Art and Technical Survey task design and results in Section 3 and 4, respectively, and introduce participants' systems in Section 5. In 2009, the Information Retrieval Facility (IRF) disposed of 2,648,160 patent files (approximately 112GB in size) from the chemical domain (classified under IPC codes C and A61K) that, after pre-processing, were available to the participants. This collection covers patents in the field until 2007, registered at three major patent offices, i.e., EPO, USPTO and WIPO. The format of the patent files is in XML.</p><p>Among these 2.6 million patent files, we distributed 1,185,012 files that contain (claims and (description or abstract)), i.e., that have enough textual information for making them useful in text retrieval. They sum up to 98.22GB of uncompressed data. Among these files, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,144.36,510.64,4.60,8.66">1</ref> shows their distribution per IPC class. There are two observations to be made: 1. Class C is "Chemistry" 2. Many patent files are classified under more than one class, hence the apparently larger number of files in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,305.40,532.60,4.60,8.66">1</ref> than the 1,185 million just mentioned. This year's track has also benefited from chemical scientific articles, kindly provided by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in the UK. This data set consists of about 59,000 scientific articles, for a total of size of around 3GB, from 31 journals published by the RSC. The format is also in XML, but different schemas have been used for the RSC and patent documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Prior Art (PA) Task</head><p>The PA Task consisted of 1,000 topics which were full-text patent documents (i.e. consisting of at least claims and abstract or description) taken from both the European Patent Office (EPO) and the US Patent Office (USPTO). However, because the number of patents in the collection that came from the USPTO was much larger than the number of patents that came from the EPO, this difference was reflected in the set of topics: only 77 were from the EPO and the rest were from USPTO.</p><p>In choosing them, we basically sampled randomly from the collection, trying to optimize two objectives: minimize the number of applicant citations (the US patent applications are notorious for citing large sets of marginally relevant patents) and maximizing the total number of citations.</p><p>Participants were also allowed to submit the results for only the first 100 topics, where time and computational resources did not allow for submitting results for all the 1,000 topics. We took these 100 topics to be the first 100 of the 1,000 topics. We had not realized at that time that the order in which the topics had been initially selected from the database, resulted in the EPO topics being first and USPTO second. This resulted in the small PA topic set having a different distribution of topic sources than the large topic set. As we will see, this only has small influence on the systems' performance.</p><p>The challenge of the PA task is that the query, i.e., a whole patent document, is typically quite long, and query processing techniques may need to employed. We consider the MRR metric as important for this task since it is desirable to locate the first relevant documents as close as possible to the top rank position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Relevance Judgements</head><p>Relevance judgements for this topic consisted of citations from the patent document that was used as a topic, as well as citations in family members of the original document.</p><p>Here we provide some background knowledge about citations and patent families. Like a research paper, a patent is, at different points in time, associated with other patents (or research papers). Before applying for a patent, the applicant must do a prior art search (as a researcher would include a literature review in a paper submitted to a conference or journal). This list of references are called Applicant's citations. Then, upon receiving the application, the patent office will review it and add another set of references, possibly rejecting the patent application. The similarity with academia is again striking: upon receiving a submission, a conference's programme committee would review the paper, suggesting other related work and possibly rejecting the submission for not being sufficiently novel. This set of references, that the patent office adds, are called Examiner's citations or Search report citations. Finally, in some cases, after a patent is published, a third party (a competing company, for instance) will oppose it, referencing works that neither the applicant, nor the examiner found, but which are very related to the new patent. This is less common in academia, but you can think of it as the situation in which, while presenting the work at the conference, a member of the audience stands up and claims that he had already solved the same problem years ago (hopefully citing some concrete works to prove that). Such references are called Opposition citations.</p><p>Putting all these references together, our collection of patents can take advantage of the large amount of manual work already done by field experts.</p><p>We can further extend this set of citations by looking at patent families. In our collection, we consider "simple" families: patents are related if they are basically the same idea submitted to different patent offices for protection in different jurisdictions <ref type="foot" coords="3,381.96,505.04,3.65,5.47" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . It is a fact that when submitted to a patent office, there is a bias of the examiner towards the collection of that specific patent office, and other documents, published elsewhere, are not cited. We compensate this by considering a patent relevant in one of the following three situations:</p><p>1. it is directly cited by the topic patent, 2. it is a family member of a patent directly cited by the topic patent, 3. it is directly cited by a family member of the topic patent.</p><p>Given the limited size of the collection and the fact that applicants, examiners and opponents have supposedly carried out rather conclusive searches, we tend to consider that this is a fully judged collection in the Cranfield style and thus most measures returned by trec eval based on the judgements are reliable indicators of systems' performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>Eight groups submitted to the short PA task. Among them, five also submitted to the full PA task, i.e., three groups did not submit to the full PA task. Comparing Table <ref type="table" coords="3,429.36,686.20,4.60,8.66">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="3,455.40,686.20,29.12,8.66" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>, the relative standings of the five groups' submitted runs, in terms of MAP, are similar.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="3,158.28,708.04,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="3,185.16,708.04,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show the results of the participating systems when considering only the EPO or the USPTO topics, respectively. We can see that most runs' performance on the Table <ref type="table" coords="4,117.84,110.21,3.90,9.62">1</ref>: Results for the best two runs from each team in terms of MAP, and performance on a range of IR metrics for the short PA task.  USPTO subset is higher than that on the EPO subset. Again, the systems' performance is plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,188.28,449.80,3.56,8.66">6</ref>. We can see that there are considerable differences (we are still to run significance tests on these differences). A particular observation is that run york09caPA01 seems to be doing much better, according to all measures, for USPTO topics than for EPO topics-this is something worth investigating. We were also interested in calculating the statistical significance of the difference of the results returned by the runs. We used the randomized test introduced by Smucker in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,466.80,504.64,9.64,8.66" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to compute the difference between the MAP results. We compared this approach with the t-test, which was argued in a series of works <ref type="bibr" coords="4,275.52,526.60,9.76,8.66" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,288.72,526.60,7.12,8.66" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,299.28,526.60,7.24,8.66" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,309.96,526.60,7.12,8.66" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,320.52,526.60,7.24,8.66" target="#b5">6]</ref> to be the second most reliable. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,114.96,537.52,4.60,8.66" target="#fig_1">3</ref> compares the results of the randomization test and the t-test. We can see that though they seem to correlate to a large extent, the t-test overestimates many p-values. Further investigation results on the groups of runs whose differences are not statistically significant, as well as on the correlation between the two types of the significance tests will be provided in the final version of this report.         </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Other observations</head><p>There are many aspects to be analysed with respect to this corpus and the measures calculated during this evaluation campaign. We could look at the distribution of these measures across patent classes, number of citations per patent, size of the patent, provenance (e.g. EPO or USPTO), kind of documents used as topics (application vs. granted patent), year of publication. In this section we look at some of them, that we found most interesting. Many others are available on the track's wiki page<ref type="foot" coords="9,292.44,560.36,3.65,5.47" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,157.80,572.68,4.60,8.66">7</ref> shows how measures 'prefer' topics which have more or less relevant documents. As we can see, MAP seems to favour topics with many relevant results, while bpref the converse.</p><p>We also looked to see if some types (i.e. classes) of patents are easier to retrieve than others. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,153.72,616.48,3.56,8.66">8</ref>, we can see for instance a clear difference between two of the most popular chemical classes: C07 (Organic Chemistry) and C08 (Organic Macromolecular Compounds), with C08 topics being on average harder than C07 ones. We can also see that A61 (Medical or Veterinary Science) has performed quite well. C23 (Coating metallic material) seems to perform less than average. Inorganic Chemistry (C01), Glass/Minerals (C03) and Cements/Concrete/Artificial Stone/Ceramic (C04) on the other hand tended to do better. Similar results are visible when looking at the Recall@100 measure (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,291.60,682.24,4.60,8.66">9</ref> On the other hand, looking at the size of the topics did not seem to provide significant insights. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,180.48,704.20,9.16,8.66">10</ref> shows that the size of the topics did not have a major impact on the values of the NDCG measure.</p><p>Each participating group is encouraged to do this analysis on their own results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Technical Survey (TS) Task</head><p>The TS task is similar to a traditional ad hoc retrieval task, however, the challenge is the way to deal with chemical specific problems such as synonyms and abbreviations. Five patent experts have kindly provided topics from their experience as patent searchers. Table <ref type="table" coords="11,471.84,155.08,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_10">9</ref> in the Appendix shows the 18 topics, which aim to find patents or articles about organic, high molecular weight, pharmaceutical, and inorganic chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Sampling and Relevance Judgements</head><p>We employed the stratified sampling approach <ref type="bibr" coords="11,311.28,220.24,9.12,8.66" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, where we sampled 100% documents to depth 10, 30% to depth 30 and 10% to depth 100. On average, 300 documents per topic were sampled for evaluation. In order to save the valuable time of the patent experts, we adopted a two-stage evaluation process. In the first stage, each topic was evaluated by two graduate students major in chemistry independently. Then their evaluation results were merged by setting a document as relevant if at least one of the two students has judged it as relevant. More precisely, the resulting evaluation was taken as the maximum between those of the two students, using the following order: -1 &lt; -2 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2, where the numerical values for relevance judgements are -2-"unsure", -1-"unjudged", 0-"not relevant", 1-"relevant", and 2-"highly relevant".</p><p>In the second stage, these merged evaluations were presented to the experts for official evaluation. They had the option to view subsets of the pool evaluated by students as: show all documents, documents judged as "relevant"/"highly relevant", or documents judged as "unsure"/"unjudged", respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Statistics of Students' Evaluations</head><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="11,143.52,403.96,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="11,168.48,403.96,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_6">6</ref> present the situation after the first phase of manual assessments conducted by graduate students in the chemical field.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="11,158.52,425.80,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the degree of disagreements per topic among the assessing students. A strict disagreement means that the two students chose two different relevance judgements, a conflictual disagreement means that one assessor considered a document as (highly) "relevant" to the topic, while the other considered it as "not relevant". Lastly, a lenient disagreement means that one of the assessors judged a document as "unsure" or left it "unjudged". Naturally, the conflictual and lenient disagreements sum up to the number of strict disagreements.</p><p>The high percentage of strict disagreements for topic Ts-4 reflects the fact that at the time of closing the first evaluation stage one of the assessors did not finish his task. We can hypothesize that a high disagreement rate means a difficult topic, while low disagreement rate indicates an easy topic.  Table <ref type="table" coords="12,154.80,214.00,4.60,8.66" target="#tab_6">6</ref> shows the percentages of relevant/not relevant documents after the two sets of judgements per topic were merged. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Exceptions</head><p>For topics Ts-9 and Ts-16, the expert decided that too many documents had been judged as relevant by the students. After further discussions, we decided to have the respective students re-evaluate the two topics, following additional instructions from the expert. While these evaluations have been done by the students, we include their results in the expert's result evaluations (see section sub4.1.2). This is because the expert assessments of these new judgements do not differ much from the student's judgements (for Ts-9 there is no difference). Unfortunately, topics Ts-1, Ts-3, Ts-10 were not judged by the patent expert, as the respective person was unavailable at the time of assessments. Therefore, the three greyed out rows in table 7 contain the relevance assessments made by the students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Procedure and used measures</head><p>We evaluated the results sampled as described in section 4.1 and computed the extended inferred average precision (xinfAP) and the inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG) as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="13,226.32,396.52,9.76,8.66" target="#b7">[8]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">xinfAP</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="13,126.24,437.80,9.21,8.66" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Yilmaz and colleagues extended the infAP measure <ref type="bibr" coords="13,350.28,437.80,9.76,8.66">[7]</ref> by taking non-random samples from the pool of documents.

The idea was to get a quick image of which topics were generally not well answered, which ones were answered only by some systems and which ones were answered by all systems.</p><p>The first thing that draws our attention is the fact that only one run (SCAI09TSMAN) submitted a fair result for topic Ts-13. Topic 13 refers to the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (Thc) as an anti-tumor agent. We note that the narrative of this topic is quite small and that the only run that performed well used a manual query formulation. We may conclude then that the text of the topic was insufficient for the systems to extract sufficiently meaningful chemical information to be able to correctly retrieve relevant documents, but this is to be further investigated in collaboration with Fraunhofer SCAI.</p><p>It is equally interesting to look at situations where one run for a particular participant performed significantly differently from the other runs of the same participant. This happens for BiTeM09po. Particularly, this run seems to do better than its peers on topics Ts-1 and Ts-11. This run used patent families as a basic unit to index instead of a document. It is unclear how this generalizes to scientific articles though.   </p></div>

These paragraphs were contributed by participants and are intended to be a road map to their papers in the TREC proceedings. Below each group name is a list of their runs submitted to each task.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Carnegie Mellon University</head><p>Prior Art runs: CMU09Chmtcdd, CMU09Chmtcd Technical Survey runs: none The focus is on date filtering and formulating ranking queries. For filtering, different date filtering criteria are tested and reported, the best strategy being filtering out publications with publication date after the latest priority date of the query patent. For ranking, using term occurrence statistics from the whole patent improves over just using terms from title and claims of the query patent. Experiments were conducted easily with the structured retrieval support of the out-of-box Lemur/Indri tool-kit.</p></div>

Regarding this objective, for the Prior Art subtask, our runs performed significantly better that runs submitted by other participating teams. Baseline retrieval methods achieved relatively poor performances (Mean Average Precision = 0.067). Query expansion, driven my chemical named entity recognition resulted in some modest improvement (+2 to 3%). Filtering based on IPC codes did not result in any significant improvement. A re-ranking strategy, based on claims only improved MAP by about 3%. The most effective gain was obtained by using patent citation patterns.</p><p>Somehow similar to feed-back but restricted to citations, we used patents cited in the retrieved patents in order to boost the retrieval status value of the baseline run. This strategy led to a remarkable improvement (MAP 0.18, +168 %). Nevertheless, as official topics were sampled from the collection disregarding their creation date, our strategy happened to exploit citations of patents which were patented after the topic itself. From a user perspective, such a setting is questionable. We think that future TREC-CHEM competitions should address this issue by using patents filed as recently as possible.</p></div>

The first three runs were based on the LMIR model, and we used a combination of the title and narrative of the topic to retrieve the documents. Moreover, we attempted the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) method to expand the original query in DUT09TSRun3. The last three runs in this task were mainly focused on structure based retrieval. We used the combination of the title and narrative to do retrieval on different fields of patents. In our experiment, some different weighting functions were used to rank each fields (e.g. title, abstract, description, claims) based on BM25F structure-based weighting model. For prior art task, we focused on formulating the queries from the query patents. We selected 60 terms with the largest probabilities (TF-IDF scores) from different fields (e.g. title, abstract, description, claims) as the original query to retrieval the relevance documents.</p></div>

Our first submission eliminated patents with priority dates later than (after) a given query patent's priority date. It also included "unnested" claims so they could stand as independent documents for comparisons. We produced two separate Lucene indexes: one with patent claims alone; the other with the title, description, abstract, and classification portions (TDAC index) and determined the most effective weighting of these summary functions when merging the results into a single list. In our second submission, we used only the primary classification information from the TDAC index to retrieve those patents with matching IPC primary classification codes. Our third submission approximated patent priority dates by patent number and assumed patent numbers reflected a temporal sequence-only those patent numbers lower than the target patent number were included.</p></div>

For technology survey task, we submitted three runs based on simple entity recognition, manual querying and automatically generated noun phrase based querying. It was observed that manual querying outperformed the remaining runs with the best nDCG score of 0.49. For prior art search task, we introduced several new fields into the conventional index that contained normalized noun phrases,biomedical as well as chemical entities.

We used synonyms (from PubChem) for chemicals that have been identified, used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list. For prior art search task; we used all title words, and selected sets of terms from the claims, abstract and description fields of query patents (top 30 terms wrt. TF-IDF scores are chosen for each) to construct the queries. From those terms, chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem. Then structured queries are formed to do retrieval over different fields of documents with different weights. Then some of the retrieved documents are filtered out from the ranked list because of date constraints. If priority dates don't exist, we use publication date as the corresponding dates. Last but not the least, IPC similarities between query patent and its retrieved patents are exploited to re-rank the retrieved documents.</p></div>

The three problems are: (1) how to deal with chemical terminology synonyms? (2) how to deal with chemical terminology abbreviation? (3)how to deal with long queries in Prior Art (PA) task? For technology survey, we proposed a chemical terminology expansion algorithm with the professional chemical domain information from two chemical websites, ChemID plus and PubChem. We also introduced an algorithm using the collection's information in prior art task for keyword selection. The Mean Average Precision (MAP) for our TS task run "york09ca07" using Algorithm 1 was 0.2519 and for our PA task run "york09caPA01" using Algorithm 2 was 0.0566.

For this we need to have knowledge on paints, coating and curable compositions. More specifically we would like to have information about a curable composition made of an organopolysiloxane having a functional group capable of condensation reaction at both molecular termini, plus one hydrophobic and, optionally, one hydrophilic silica. We would also need information on thermally treating such a curable composition. 2 Dipetidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors pharmaceuticals We are a new pharmaceutical company that is interested in entering the area of Dipetidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors. This is a relatively new therapeutic area for the treatment of type-2 diabetes but we know that there are compounds already generated by several pharmaceutical companies (including a marketed drug from Merck called Januvia) for this indication. We are interested in discovering the compounds that have been identified so far for inhibiting this enzyme and which companies they are associated with. It would also be useful to determine if there is more than one chemical class of compounds that is used to inhibit this enzyme or if several classes have been identified. 3 methods for controlling molecular weight of polyhydroxyalkanoate organic, high molecular weight</p><p>We are a group of researchers in an university/company. We want to start a project and, before starting, we want more informations about polyhydroxyalkanoate and about methods for controlling molecular weight of polyhydroxyalkanoate constituted of units containing residue of phenyl-, thienyl-, or cyclohexyl-structure in side chain of molecule. Therefore, we are doing an information search to have a better understanding of this area. We are particularly interested in finding methods for controlling the molecular weight of a polyhydroxyalkanoate containing at least one of a 3-hydroxy-?-substituted alkanoic acid unit (1) and a 3-hydroxyω-cyclohexylalkanoic acid unit (2) wherein a microorganism is cultivated, in the presence of a hydroxyl group-containing compound, which is capable of producing the polyhydroxyalkanoate containing at least one of the units represented by ( <ref type="formula" coords="19,530.18,148.63,3.40,6.72">1</ref>) or ( <ref type="formula" coords="19,552.74,148.63,3.40,6.72">2</ref>) from an ω-substituted alkanoic acid (3) or ω-cyclohexylalkanoic acid (4). The 3-hydroxy-ω-substituted alkanoic acid unit (1) should also have a residue having a ring structure of any one selected from the group consisting of a phenyl structure and a thienyl structure. In the presence of plural units, the residues are selected independently for the respective units. The 3-hydroxy-ω-cyclohexylalkanoic acid unit (2) should exhibit a substituent on the cyclohexyl group selected from the group consisting of H atom, CN, NO2, halogen atom, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, CF3, C2F5 and C3F7. In the presence of plural units, the substituents are selected independently for the respective units. The ω-substituted alkanoic acid (3) should also have a residue having a ring structure of any one selected from the group consisting of a phenyl structure and a thienyl structure. In the presence of plural units, the residues are selected independently for the respective units. The ω-cyclohexylalkanoic acid (4) should exhibit a substituent on the cyclohexyl group selected from the group consisting of H atom, CN, NO2, halogen atom, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, CF3, C2F5 and C3F7. In the presence of plural units, the substituents are selected independently for the respective units. We represent a company that makes ink-jet printing inks for high volume applications. We have started working with hyperbranched polyesteramides and in order to create our own formulations we need to know what other substances are typically combined with these in ink solutions. We would like to know if there are any patent or literature references which describe the use of hyperbranched polyesteramides in ink formulations. 10 catalysts for simultaneous hydrotreating and hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons inorganic We are a group of researchers in an university/company. We want to start a project and, before starting, we want more informations about catalysts for the simultaneous hydrotreating and hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons.Therefore, we are doing an information search to have a better understanding of this area. We are particularly interested in finding a catalyst for dewaxing a hydrocarbon feedstock containing waxy paraffins under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure. This catalyst comprises a Group VIB metal component on a support comprising a porous refractory oxide in intimate admixture with an essentially Group IIIA metal-free crystalline silica molecular sieve having channels with apertures defined by ten membered rings of oxygen atoms.
