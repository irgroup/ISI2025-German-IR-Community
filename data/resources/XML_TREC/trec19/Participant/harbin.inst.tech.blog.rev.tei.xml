<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Blog track explores information seeking behavior in the blogosphere <ref type="bibr" coords="1,156.74,543.96,11.59,9.88" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In TREC 2010, the Blog track has two tasks: Faceted Blog Distillation Task and Top Stories Identification Task. Faceted blog distillation is a more refined version of the blog distillation task, addressing the quality aspect of the retrieved blogs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,142.81,621.98,11.59,9.88" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Our group from Language Technology Research Center of Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT_LTRC) participated in the first task.</p><p>We considered our implementation as a two-step procedure. The first step was to retrieve blogs that were relevant to a topic or query. This was an Information Retrieval (IR) process, and the Indri 1   The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the preprocessing of the data, Section 3 and Section 4 introduce the methods and runs of baseline blog distillation and faceted blog distillation, in section 5, the evaluation results of our runs are given, and section 6 concludes our work. toolkit was used. The second step was to assign particular facets of interest to the retrieved blogs. For the second step, a Maximum Entropy (ME) model toolkit was applied for text classification on specified facet and blogs extracted according to the Qrel (query-relevance files) of blog track 2009 were used as training documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preprocessing</head><p>The Blog track 2010 used Blogs08 dataset 2 1 . The Blogs08 dataset contains permalinks, feeds and blog homepages, and only permalink pages were used in our participation for the faceted blog distillation task. We applied Indri to build index, and specify some fields as metadata, such as title, feedno, docno, for the index so that we could search and combine blogs to feeds flexibly. When building in-dex, the DiffPost algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.15,60.90,12.84,9.88" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was applied to filter the non-relevant contents. Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.97,76.50,12.84,9.88" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and 415 stop words were also used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Baseline Blog Distillation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Query construction</head><p>In the baseline stage, our queries were constructed by two ways: automatically and manually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Automatic Construction</head><p>Automatic query construction follows three steps below:</p><p>1) Extract the content of Query field of a topic with stop words removed and construct indri-style query as the first sub-query; 2) Considering the importance of blog title, construct title context query according the result of step 1) as the second sub-query; 3) Combine the two sub-queries in different weights. According our experiments, the weight of the first sub-query is given 0.7, and the second is given 0.3. An example of an automatic query is shown below: &lt;query&gt; &lt;number&gt;1102 &lt;/number&gt; &lt;text&gt;#weight(0.3 #combine(Wal-Mart.(title) communities.(title) ) 0.7 #combine( Wal-Mart communities ))&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/query&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Manual Construction</head><p>Manual query construction follows five steps below:</p><p>1) Extract the content of query field of a topic with stop words removed and construct the first sub-query; 2) Recognize the keywords in desc field by manual work, combine these words by "or" and "combine" operator, then construct the second sub-query; 3) Recognize the keywords in narr field, combine them by "or" and "combine" operator, then construct the third sub-query; 4) The content of query field of a topic can be regarded as the most concise version of the topic. So, construct a compound query by combining the three sub-queries with different weights, 0.6 for the 1st, 0. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Retrieval Method</head><p>In this step, the relevant feeds were retrieved by queries without facet. Since a feed could be regarded as a collection of blogs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,454.63,471.49,11.59,9.88" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, relevant score of a feed could be calculated according to the relevant scores of blogs within the feed. We retrieved 10,000 blogs for a query, and call the result as topic-relevant blogs list. Then we calculated feeds relevant score based on the hypotheses of Global Evidence Model (GEM) and Local Evidence Model (LEM) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.91,580.70,11.59,9.88" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and then ranked the feeds list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Score</head><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,324.43,602.14,217.33,83.35">Score Score LEM GEM feed ) 1 ( α α - + = (1) | | Feed Score Score rel GEM ∑ = (2) N Score Score topn rel LEM ∑ = ) (<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,362.81,689.88,3.90,9.88" target="#formula_2">2</ref>), Score rel is the relevant score of a blog belong to the feed, and |Feed| is the count of blogs in the feed. In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,152.94,76.50,3.90,9.88" target="#formula_0">3</ref>), Score rel(topn) is the top N relevant score in the feed, and α =0.1. During our ex- periments, we found that the mean average precision (MAP) of experiments' results will be higher while N is given 1 or 2. These events are also consistent with the hypotheses of LEM. Also, Statistics for |Feed| shows that the |Feed| of half of feeds in the dataset is less than 50. So the value of N is determined by the following conditions:</p><p>(4)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Baseline Runs</head><p>In the baseline blog distillation task, we submitted two runs as follows:</p><p>1) hitQuerybl denotes automatic with the query field of a topic. 2) hitTDNbl denotes manual run, with the query, desc, narri field of a topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Faceted Blog Distillation</head><p>The basic idea of this stage was adopting the Maximum Entropy model to predict a blog's inclination on a specified facet, and then calculating the faceted relevance in feed level. Two methods were applied to implement the idea: One method was based on the topic-relevant blogs list, and the other was based on the baseline result.</p><p>By analyzing documents extracted according to Qrel of blog track 2009, many obvious features could be found:</p><p>1) Opinionated, personal, shallow blogs generally had more subjective words than factual, official, in-depth blogs; 2) Personal, shallow blogs might have shorter length than official, in-depth blogs; 3) The first person words, 'I', 'We' and 'Our', were more likely to appear in personal, shallow blogs than in official, in-depth blogs.</p><p>According to manual analysis, subjective words were chosen as major features, also including document length and the count of first person words in a document. SentiWordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.94,107.76,12.84,9.88" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is a lexical resource for opinion mining, which assigns to each synset of WordNet three sentiment scores: positivity, negativity, and objectivity. In this part, SentiWordNet3.0 <ref type="foot" coords="3,543.24,152.23,3.51,6.32" target="#foot_1">3</ref>To calculate the real length of a blog, regular expressions were applied to identify the time when the blog was submitted or the time of the first comment.</p><p>was employed to obtain a set of subjective words. A word in SentiWordNet3.0 was regarded as subjective word if its average subjective value (a word may have different subjective values in distinct synonym sets) was above 0.5.</p><p>For opinionated facet, subjective words and their statistics were considered as major features. Besides subjective words, the first person words 'I', 'We', 'Our' and the length of blog were also taken as feature for in-depth facet and personal facet.</p><p>Based on these features, blogs' faceted inclination could be predicted, and blogs' faceted relevance can be calculated.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,318.73,424.33,244.73,82.97">P Score Score Score l l Facet * ) 1 ( Re Re 1 λ λ - + = (5) ) 1 ( * ) 1 ( Re Re 2 P Score Score Score l l Facet - - + = λ λ (6)</formula><p>In Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,364.10,513.30,4.28,9.88">5</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,418.99,513.30,3.89,9.88">6</ref>), Score Rel is the topic relevant score; P is the probability of a document determined opinionated, shallow or personal by ME model, and 1-P is the probability of a document determined factual, in-depth or official; Score Facet1 is the first faceted relevant score of a blog, and Score Facet2 is the second faceted relevant score of a blog.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training documents Extraction</head><p>Training documents for ME model were ex-tracted according to the Qrel of blog track 2009. Qrel could be regarded as manual faceted tags in feed level. However, not all blogs in the feeds are highly relevant to specified facet. A trial method to extract training data was taking advantage of the features of blogs in different facet shown above.</p><p>The training data in our system was extracted as following steps:</p><p>1) Filter the blogs with length less than 100 words; 2) Calculate the percentage of subjective words (subjective words divided by total words) in each blog; 3) Sort the blogs by the percentage of subjective words in descending order when facet value are opinionated, personal, shallow, and in ascending order in other cases(factual, in-depth, official).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Choose the top N blogs as training data,</head><p>where N = |Feed|*10%, then refine the value of N to 1 if N &lt; 1, and to10 if N &gt; 10;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Features Selection</head><p>There were four kinds of features selected in our method. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Statistics of subjective words in title:</head><p>①Count of subjective words in title. Content (submitted by blog owner) and comments (submitted by guests) of a document may have different contribution to the document's faceted inclination. So the features of document's content and of document's comments are extracted respectively. Finally, the entire document's feature, the content's feature, and the comments' feature are combined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Faceted Distillation on Topic Relevant Blogs List</head><p>Topic-relevant blogs list contained 10000 relevant blogs per topic. In this method, a blog in topic-relevant blogs list was predicted by a ME model corresponding to its topic facet, with the predicted result P (P opinionated , P shallow and P personal ). Then the faceted relevant score of blog can be calculated applying Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,369.53,393.49,4.26,9.88">5</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,421.05,393.49,3.88,9.88">6</ref>).</p><p>The faceted relevant score of feeds can be calculated by applying Score Facet1 and Score Facet2 into Eq. (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Faceted Distillation on Baseline</head><p>Baseline system retrieved results without facet consideration, and faceted inclination of each blog in baseline feeds could be predicted by ME model. According to LEM-GEM hypotheses, we could calculate the faceted inclination of baseline feeds. </p><p>In Eq. (7) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,174.49,107.70,3.90,9.88">8</ref>), α = 0.1, P feed-facet1 and P feed-facet2 is the first and second faceted inclination probability of a feed, P doc-facet1 and P doc-facet2 is the first and second faceted inclination probability of a blog, and P doc-facet1 = 1 -P doc-facet2 .</p><p>The faceted relevant score of a feed could be calculated with Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,156.92,201.31,4.28,9.88">9</ref>) and Eq. (10). In Eq.9 and Eq.10, λ= 0.8, Score Rel is the rele-vant score of a feed in baseline, Score Facet1 and Score Facet2 is the first and second faceted relevant score of a feed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Score Score</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Faceted Runs</head><p>In the faceted blog distillation task, we submitted seven runs as follows:</p><p>1) hitQFeedR used topic-relevant blogs list retrieved according automatic query. 2) hitTDNfeedR used topic-relevant blogs list retrieved according manual query. 3) hitQFeedbl uses hitQuerybl baseline. 4) hitTDNfeedbl used hitTDNbl baseline. 5) hitFeeds1 used stdbaseline1 baseline. 6) hitFeeds2 used stdbaseline2 baseline. 7) hitFeeds3 used stdbaseline3 baseline. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>The primary measure for evaluating submitted runs is the mean average precision (MAP). With our methodology, we achieved the following results: Table <ref type="table" coords="6,95.40,289.45,5.49,9.88" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows the query relevant results of the baseline runs. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,157.64,305.05,5.49,9.88" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and table 3 show the faceted results of the baseline runs and the faceted runs. In table 2, the three runs, stdbaseline1, stdbaseline2, and stdbaseline3 denote the three provided standard baselines. In table 3, the result of the run based on topic-relevant blogs list (that means no baseline) was inferior to the results of the run based on our baseline. Comparing table 3 with table 2, our faceted results can make improvements in some facets. According to table 4, the mean facet MAP values of faceted runs are compared with the mean MAP values of the baseline runs. Three runs have consistently improved upon the faceted performances of the three provided standard baselines, but the other two runs failed to improve the faceted performance of our own baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>This is the first time that our group participates in TREC Blog track. In this paper, we present our method for the faceted blog distillation. Our approach may be simple but straightforward. In the baseline stage, the indri was used as retrieval platform, and the title context query was built for the consideration to the importance of blog title. Experiment results proved that the title context query help to retrieve more relevant blogs. In the faceted stage, our Maximum Entropy model toolkit was applied to predict documents inclination, and subjective words from SentiWordNet were used as main features. The LEM-GEM assumption was implemented in two ways to calculate feeds' facet relevance. Results show that the second, based on baseline, is more effective.</p><p>Although our method performed consistent improvements upon the three provided standard baselines, the improvements were not notable. The feature selection and the training documents extraction may cause this limitation. The features, mainly included subjective words, were shared by three facets. This seemed to be arbitrary. Training documents were extracted by the Qrel of blog track 2009. The extracted documents may not be accurately tagged according to the facet.
