<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) participated in TREC-2004, submitting 18 runs. We focus on studying the problem of the combination of the user-and query-information from clarification forms and metadata. We provided two kinds of Clarification Form. Our experiment shows the CF2 is more effective than CF1. We use Google as a resource for query expansion base on metadata subject and familiarity together, and the R-prec is increased from 0.2308 (baseline) to 0.2646 (+14.6%). Our approach to exploiting the metadata Genre and Geography yield negative result when used alone, however, surprisedly, when combinate metadata Genre and metadata Geography with CF2 respectively, we get an increase (+1.2%) and (+5.4%) than use CF2 alone. Our combination of CF2 and metadata relt_text is the best results of all the TREC runs (R-prec), and in this run, the R-prec is increased from 0.3303 (CF2 alone) to 0.3766 (+14%), and from 0.2888 (metadata rel-text alone) to 0.3766 (+30.4%). From the results we can see the information from user (CF2) and the information from query (metadata relt-text) may complement each other. ISCAS_0 no no no Document Baselin-1 Chastdn_1 no no no Document/Passage Baseline-2 Chascfw_2 CF1 no no Document/Passage Chascfd_3 CF2 no no Document/Passage Chascfwd_4 CF2 no no Document/Passage Same as Chascfd_3, Only different at word weight Chasbsubfam_5 no Subject&amp;Familiarity no Document/Passage Based on Google Chasbcsubfam_6 no Subject&amp;Familiarity no Document/Ptassage CF2 is used to decide to use Google or not Chascfsubfam_7 CF2 Subject&amp;Familiarity no Document/Passage Same as Chasbsubfam_5, Only different at word weight Chasccsubfam_8 CF2 Subject&amp;Familiarity no Document/Passage Same as Chasbsubfam_6, Only different at word weight Chasbaserel_9 no no yes Document/Passage Only use noun word in relt texts Chasbasegen_10 no Genre no Document/Passage Chasbaseger_11 no Geography no Document/Passage Chascfrel_12 CF2 no yes Document/Passage Only use noun word in relt texts Chascfgen_13 CF2 Genre no Document/Passage Chascfger_14 CF2 Geography no Document/Passage Chasregenger_15 CF2 Genre &amp; Geography yes Document/Passage Chasdcfd_16 CF2 no no Document Chasdcfwd_17 CF2 no no Document Same as Chasdcfd_16, Only different at word weight Chasdcfw_18 CF1 no no Document</p><p>In table 2 the R-Prec and Avg Prec of our submission runs for document level are showed. ISCAS_0 is our baseline-1 run and no query expansion is used. There are two differences between ISCAS_0 and Chastdn_1. One is ISCAS_0 only use title section of a query but Chastdn_1 use both title and description section of a query. The other is ISCAS_0 is document level but Chastdn_1 is document and passage level. In the following experiments, we always use title and description section of a query as input.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) participated in TREC-2004 in all the three aspects of the HARD task. We focus on studying the problem of the combination of the userand query-information from clarification forms and metadata. We provided two kinds of clarification form. One is a term list; the other is a title list. Metadata subject and familiarity are used together base on Google. Feature term lists are built for Metadata Genre and Geography respectively. For passage retrieval, we first cut these documents into small pieces and then do the same run as document retrieval. We totally submitted 18 results that are constructed automatically though some of them are time consuming. The following subsections describe the system design for each of the runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">System Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">IR model</head><p>We focus our research on the using of the CF and metadata, so no much work is done about the IR model. VSM is employed to calculate the similarity between query vector and document vector <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.19,91.95,12.10,9.45" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,126.29,91.95,8.06,9.45" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.36,91.95,8.06,9.45" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.42,91.95,8.06,9.45" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,150.48,91.95,8.06,9.45" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The term of vector is word. If T={ t j } is a term set, then query vector v j of topic j can be express V j =(v j1 ,v j2 ,….v jn ), in which v jk denotes the weight of t k in v j . The vector D i =(d i1 ,d i2 ,….,d in ) denotes a document, d ik denotes the weight of t k in d i . The similarity between v j and d i is calculated by following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,207.54,158.62,164.89,31.71">∑ ∑ ∑ + * = = 2 2 1 jk ik n k jk ik j v d v d s</formula><p>The IR system we used is the Lemur toolkit (version 2.2) developed by CMU <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.03,201.15,11.18,9.45">[6]</ref>. The Lemur Toolkit is designed to facilitate research in language modeling and information retrieval, where IR is broadly interpreted to include such technologies as ad hoc and distributed retrieval, cross-language IR, summarization, filtering, and classification. The toolkit supports indexing of large-scale text databases, the construction of simple language models for documents, queries, or sub-collections, and the implementation of retrieval systems based on language models as well as a variety of other retrieval models. The system is written in the C and C++ languages, and is designed as a research system to run under Unix operating systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Clarification Forms</head><p>We provided two kinds of clarification form. One is a list of keywords that might appear in relevant documents, the other is a list of the title and keywords of the top 10 relevant documents. The user is asked to judge the keywords or the title and keywords for a query as being "Good", "Bad", or "Unknown". The user can also input additional terms that help define or disambiguate the topic area for a query. The clarification form CHAS1 and CHAS2 are show in the following figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,117.84,450.75,5.25,9.45" target="#fig_3">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="2,143.62,450.75,3.95,9.45" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Exploiting Metadata</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject &amp; Familiarity</head><p>We use metadata subject &amp; Familiarity together base on Google. Google is used as a resource for query expansion. First input the title of a query to Google. Then choose the related web site from the top 3. If the sites' Google directory is classified the same as the subject show at metadata of the query, then these web sites are related sites for the query. As a special case, if none of the top 3 sites is classified the exactly same as the metadata subject, we only choose top 1 as related site. How many texts within the related site should be used as related texts is decided by metadata familiarity based on an assumption, that is, the less the user is familiar with a topic, the more he wants to know. For example, if the metadata of a query is little, then use crawler to get 2 level of web pages as the resource for query expansion; if the metadata of a query is much, then only get 1 level of web pages as the resource for query expansion. The texts of the related web pages are extracted and POS tagged. Only use these frequently appeared noun words in the related texts for query expansion. Here is the example for query HARD-401, 402 and 403. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genre</head><p>Two feature term lists related to different Genres, named Report Feature Word List(RFWL) and Opinion Feature Word List(OFWL), are constructed manually. RFWL contains some words which often appear in the news reports with high frequency such as "report" , "say", " quote ". For news report usually starts by location and time information such as "local daily the New Vision reported Tuesday ", so we also add the time information like "Tuesday" "Monday" into the RFWL to represent the features of news report. OFWL contains some words which can be regarded as the features of opinion-biased document such as "editorial " , " opinion ", " perspective "," comment".</p><p>The basic assumption is that if one document contains enough feature words listed in RFWL or OFWL, it will be regarded as the news report or opinion-editorial. So we re-rank the retrieval results by adopting the following strategy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,111.78,232.89,11.66,9.45">(a)</formula><p>If the requirement of the Genre metadata is "news-report " in the query, we will count the feature words in the document by looking up the RFWL. When the count is above 5 in one document, we will promote the ranking position of the document (10 position higher).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b)</head><p>If the requirement of the Genre metadata is "opinion-editorial ", we will count the feature words in the document by looking up the OFWL. When the count is above 5 in one document, we will promote the ranking position of the document in ranking list (10 position higher).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c)</head><p>If the requirement of the Genre metadata is "other ", we will punish the document that belongs to "news-report" or " opinion-editorial" by decreasing the ranking position of the document in ranking list (10 position lower).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(d)</head><p>If the requirement of the Genre metadata is "any", we will keep the original ranking list without any position promotion or decreasing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geography:</head><p>In order to make use of the Geography metadata in queries, we construct a list that contains the main U.S. state names and some big city names. The basic assumption is that the topic of the document is relative with U.S. if it contains many U.S. state or city names. So we re-rank the retrieval results by adopting the following strategy:</p><p>(a) If the requirement of the Geography metadata is "U.S." in the query, we will count the city names and state names in the document by looking up the name list. When the count is above 5 in one document, we will promote the ranking position of the document (10 position higher). (b)</p><p>If the requirement of the Geography metadata is "non-U.S.", we will count the city names and state names in the document by looking up the name list. When the count is above 5 in one document, we will decrease the ranking position of the document in ranking list (10 position lower). (c)</p><p>If the requirement of the Geography metadata is "any", we will keep the original ranking list without any position promotion or decreasing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Text:</head><p>The relevant texts are used as the basis for automatic query expansion. A POS tagger is used and only high frequency noun words (except stop words) in the related text are used for query expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results Analysis</head><p>We submitted 1 baseline run and 18 other runs all together. We combined all the above information by different ways and wish could get more accurate ranked lists. The details of our submission experiments are show in table 1 that denotes an experiment and how the original query was constructed. As we can see from table 2, the R-prec of Chasfw_2 is increased from 0.2308 (Chastdn_1, baseline-2) to 0.2569 (+11.3%) for use CF1 as query expansion, and the R-prec of Chascfd_3 is increased from 0.2308 to 0.3303 (+43.1%) for use CF2 as query expansion. So the CF2 is more effective than CF1. There is no significant improvement between Chascfd_3 and Chascfwd_4 for the only difference is word weight at query expansion.</p><p>At Chasbsubfam_5 we use Google as a resource for query expansion base on metadata subject and familiarity together, and the R-prec is increased from 0.2308 to 0.2646 (+14.6%). At Chasbcsubfam_6, we use CF2 to decide to use Google as a resource for query expansion or not, that is, if there are above 5 documents at CF2 which are denoted by user as good, then no query expansion is used. We can see from table 2 there is no significant R-prec improvement between Chassubfam_5 and Chasbcsubfam_6. At Chascfsubfam_7 and Chasccsubfam_8, we use both CF2 and metadata subject &amp; familiarity as query expansion, and we can see the R-prec of Chascfsubfam_7 is increased from 0.3303 (Chascfd_3, CF2 alone) to 0.3416 (+3.4%).</p><p>At Chasbaserel_9, we only use metadata related text as query expansion, and get an improvement from 0.2308 to 0.2888 (+25.1%) for R-prec.</p><p>We use metadata Genre and metadata Geography respectively at Chasbasegen_10 and Chasbaseger_11, and get a decrease of R-prec from 0.2308 to 0.1913 (-17.1%) and from 0.2308 to 0.2119 (-8.2%). So our approach to exploiting the metadata Genre and Geography yield negative result when used alone.</p><p>As we can see from table 2 the chasfrel_12 is the best of all the TREC runs. At this run, we use both the CF2 and metadata relt_text as the base for query expansion. The combination of the userinformation (CF2) and query-information (metadata relt_text) get significant improvement, and the R-prec is increased from 0.3303 (Chascfd_3, CF2 alone) to 0.3766 (+14%), and from 0.2888 (Chasbaserel_9, metadata rel-text alone) to 0.3766 (+30.4%). From the results we can see the information from user (CF2) and the information from query (metadata relt-text) may complement each other.</p><p>At Chascfgen_13, we combinate the user-information (CF2) and query-information (metadata Genre ), and get a little increase from 0.3303 (Chascfd_3, CF2 alone) to 0.3355 (+1.2%). Similarly, at Chascfger_14, we combinate the user-information (CF2) and query-information (metadata Geography ), and get an increase from 0.3303 (Chascfd_3, CF2 alone) to 0.3483 (+5.4%). Finally, we combinate the user-information (CF2) and query-information (metadata rel-text, metadata Genre, metadata Geography ) and get an improvement for R-prec from 0.3483 (Chascfger_14) to 0.3710 (+6.5%).</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,131.10,403.95,3.95,9.45" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the comparison of TREC Median and Maximum to ISCAS's submitted baseline run (ISCAS_0) and ISCAS's best submitted run (chascfrel_12) is showed.  We participated in all the three aspects of the HARD task and focus on studying the problem of the combination of the user-and query-information from clarification forms and metadata. We totally submitted 18 results that are constructed automatically. We provided two kinds of clarification form. CF1 is a list of keywords that might appear in relevant documents, and CF2 is a list of the title and keywords of the top 10 relevant documents. From our experiment, we can see the CF2 is more effective than CF1. We use Google as a resource for query expansion base on metadata subject and familiarity together, and the R-prec is increased from 0.2308 (baseline) to 0.2646 (+14.6%).</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="7,104.29,671.90,345.10,33.95">A R D -4 0 2 H A R D -4 0 6 H A R D -4 0 9 H A R D -4 1 2 H A R D -4 1 5 H A R D -4 1 8 H A R D -4 2 1 H A R D -4 2 4 H A R D -4 2 7 H A R D -4 3 0 H A R D -4 3 4 H A R D -4 3 7 H A R D -4 4 1 H A R D -4<label>4</label></formula><p>It's seems our approach to exploiting the metadata Genre (R-prec -17.1%) and Geography (R-prec -8.2%) yield negative result when used alone, however, surprisedly, when combinate metadata Genre and metadata Geography with CF2 respectively we get an increase (+1.2%) and (+5.4%) than CF2 alone.</p><p>Our combination of the user-information (CF2) and query-information (metadata relt_text) is the best results of all the TREC runs (R-prec), and in this run, the R-prec is increased from 0.3303 (CF2 alone) to 0.3766 (+14%), and from 0.2888 (metadata rel-text alone) to 0.3766 (+30.4%).</p><p>From the results we can see the information from user (CF2) and the information from query (metadata relt-text) may complement each other.</p><p>More experiments and analysis are needed in near future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,176.58,715.95,242.10,9.45;2,90.00,464.70,387.65,228.60"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: CHAS1 Clarification Form for Query Hard-409</figDesc><graphic coords="2,90.00,464.70,387.65,228.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
