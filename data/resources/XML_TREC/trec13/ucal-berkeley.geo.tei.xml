<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The TREC 2004 Genomics Track consisted of an ad hoc retrieval task and a categorization task, which in turn had two sub-tasks, triage and annotation. This year, the Berkeley BioText group participated in all three tasks. The ad hoc task was a traditional search task. The collection consisted of a ten year subset of MED-LINE (about 4.5 million documents) and 50 topics derived from information needs obtained via interviewing biomedical researchers. There was no training data, other than five sample topics and relevance judgments.</p><p>The goal of the categorization task was to mimic activities performed by curators in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) project <ref type="bibr" coords="1,433.12,313.53,9.97,8.74" target="#b5">[8]</ref>. Human curators at MGI annotate genes and proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) codes based on evidence found in documents. The Gene Ontology <ref type="bibr" coords="1,430.86,349.39,15.50,8.74" target="#b8">[11]</ref> is a controlled vocabulary of terms (GO codes) describing gene product attributes. It is organized into three disjoint hierarchies: molecular functions (MF), biological processes (BP) and cellular components (CC). Examples of GO codes are: GO:0030246 (carbohydrate binding, a MF), GO:0007067 (mitosis, a BP) and GO:0005634 (nucleus, a CC).</p><p>In MGI, a gene is annotated with a GO code only if there is a document that contains evidence to support the annotation. The Gene Ontology defines nine evidence codes. Examples of evidence codes include: inferred from mutant phenotype (IMP), inferred from direct assay (IDA) and inferred by curator (IC).</p><p>Manual GO code assignment is a three step process. In the first step, all documents that talk about the mouse and its biology are identified. In the second step, a decision is made about which of the documents identified in step one have experimental evidence warranting GO code annotation. Articles that pass the second step are then manually entered into the MGI system with a tag for GO code, mapping, expression, etc. and with a target gene(s) assigned. In the third step, curators assign GO and evidence codes to the target gene(s) in each document.</p><p>The triage task corresponds to step two above, identifying which papers contain experimental evidence, while the annotation task corresponds to part of step three, annotating document-gene pairs with GO hierarchy codes (i.e. MF, BP and CC, not the codes themselves) and optionally with evidence codes.</p><p>The data for the categorization task consisted of documents from three journals: the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC), the Journal of Cell Biology (JCB), and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), for a total of 11,880 documents. The articles from 2002 were used for training and those from 2003 for testing.</p><p>Below we describe our approach for each task, beginning with the annotation task, which was the most novel of our approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Annotation Task</head><p>The requirement for the annotation task was to assign GO hierarchy codes (MF, BP and CC) to documentgene pairs. Optionally, we could assign the evidence codes for the annotation. There were 1,418 document-gene pairs in the training set and 877 pairs in the testing set. The evaluation used the F -measure defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,155.44,376.88,145.58,22.31">F = 2×P ×R P + R ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P is the precision and R is the recall.</p><p>The novelty of our approach centers around our methods for restricting and filtering the candidate GO codes. We use information about species whose genomes are similar to the mouse genome, and about which kinds of GO codes can logically co-occur, using a measure based on the κ coefficient <ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.48,492.59,14.61,8.74" target="#b7">[10]</ref>. This produces high recall but low precision. To improve the latter, we use an SVM classifier that was applied to three of the five submitted runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">General Procedure</head><p>In this section we present our general procedure for extracting GO codes. In a nutshell, we pre-processed the documents and the GO codes, identified the target genes in text and extracted the GO codes within a fixed size window around the target genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Gene Identification</head><p>Several gene tagging tools were made available to the participants, including YAGI <ref type="bibr" coords="2,206.79,712.04,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[6]</ref>, LingPipe <ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.56,712.04,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[3]</ref> and AbGene <ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.42,724.00,9.96,8.74">[1]</ref>. While they identify most of the genes mentioned in the text, they do not tell us which of these refer to the target gene. For this reason we used our own gene identification tool, developed for last year's Genomics Track <ref type="bibr" coords="2,414.77,121.82,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[7]</ref>. Our module assigns Lo-cusLink ID(s), thus making straightforward the identification of the target gene.</p><p>However, the LocusLink gene names and synonyms had insufficient coverage, so we augmented them with gene names extracted from the MGI database, linking them to the corresponding LocusLink IDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">GO Codes Identification</head><p>We built a table consisting of the text corresponding to the definition of each GO code. For each GO code's text, we eliminated stop words and punctuation characters and divided the text into tokens using space as a delimiter.</p><p>When processing the full text of a journal article, our system first identified locations of target genes, and then searched for GO codes within a window centered around the target gene. In each window, we assigned a GO code to a gene if we found a proportion of GO term tokens larger than a threshold (0.8 in our experiments).</p><p>Having found an occurrence of a GO code, we assigned to the document-gene pair the GO hierarchy code corresponding to that GO code. For example, if we found in the text the GO code protein binding, we assigned MF to the document-gene pair since protein binding is a molecular function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Searching for Only a Subset of the GO codes</head><p>The GO ontology currently contains about 16,700 GO codes. Presumably, searching in text for all possible GO codes will result in a large number of false positives. Thus we decided to limit the set of GO codes that would be considered possible candidates.</p><p>For each gene we aimed to search for only the GO codes we expect to find in text for that gene. Given that mice, humans and rats are species with similar genomes, our assumption was that there should be an overlap between the GO codes a mouse gene is annotated with and the GO codes its homologous genes (human and rat genes with the same name as the mouse gene) annotations.</p><p>To find the expected GO codes for a gene, we used the GO annotation database (GOA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,467.06,735.95,10.79,8.74" target="#b6">[9]</ref>) from the Eu-ropean Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.43,97.91,9.97,8.74" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. GOA contains annotations of human and rat gene products with GO codes. Thus, for a mouse gene we search in text only for the GO codes its homologous genes are annotated with in GOA. For example, for mouse gene desmin, we search for only the GO codes that human and rat genes with name desmin are annotated with in GOA.</p><p>For the training set we found annotations for 60% of the genes, for a total of 1,553 GO codes. Since we were missing annotations for about half of the genes, we decided to use this set of 1,553 GO codes as a pool from which to draw labels for the entire collection. We refer to this as the GOA subset.</p><p>In addition to the subset of GO codes annotated to homologous genes, we experimented with a subset of MGI codes. More precisely, since the training collection consisted of articles from 2002, our subset contained the GO codes annotated to genes in MGI before 2002. This subset had 1,791 GO codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Filtering GO Codes using κ Coefficient</head><p>Due to the nature of biomedical text, it is possible to find GO codes in text that are illogical. For example, if a gene is involved in RNA transcription, this cannot happen outside the cell, so if we find in the text both strings RNA transcription and extracellular, one has to be eliminated. To eliminate such illogical groupings, we used again the GOA human database.</p><p>For each pair of GO codes annotated to a gene (GO 1 and GO 2 ) we compute the κ coefficient <ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.80,520.37,15.50,8.74" target="#b7">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,274.83,520.37,12.73,8.74" target="#b10">13]</ref> as follows.</p><p>Consider the following variables a: the number of times the gene is annotated with both codes;</p><p>b: the number of times the gene is annotated with GO 1 but not with GO 2 ;</p><p>c: the number of times the gene is annotated with GO 2 but not with GO 1 ; and d: the number of times the gene is not annotated with GO 1 or GO 2 .</p><p>The actual and the expected probabilities that GO 1 and GO 2 are annotated to the same gene are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,383.55,105.83,156.45,22.31">A f = a + d a + b + c + d<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,349.51,132.53,190.50,9.65">E f = P 1 * P 2 + (1 -P 1 ) * (1 -P 2)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,310.98,155.51,229.02,20.69">P 1 = (a + b)/(a + b + c + d), P 2 = (a + c)/(a + b + c + d).</formula><p>Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,370.13,213.58,169.88,23.23">κ(GO 1 , GO 2 ) = A f -E f 1 -E f<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We compute the κ coefficient between every pair of GO codes annotated to a gene in the GOA human database. The κ coefficient takes values between -1 and 1. GO codes that are both frequently annotated to a gene have positive κ coefficients. GO codes that are not annotated together to genes have 0 or negative κ coefficients.</p><p>We use the κ coefficients to eliminate illogical GO codes as follows. In particular, we eliminate a GO code that does not have positive κ coefficients with more than 75% of the rest of GO codes found in the text for that gene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Filtering GO Codes with an SVM Classifier</head><p>Experimental results showed that our technique for identifying GO hierarchy codes achieves high recall, but low precision. For example, on training data using the MGI subset (which in this case contains GO codes annotated before 2002) and a window of 10, we obtained a recall of 0.75, but a precision of only 0.24.</p><p>To improve precision, we filter the GO codes using an SVM classifier provided as part of the open source machine learning package WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis [5, 14]) from the University of Waikato, New Zealand.</p><p>There are three GO hierarchy codes MF, BP and CC, so we can train three separate binary classifiers, one for each hierarchy code. Since we obtain a sufficiently high recall by just extracting GO codes from text, we only resort to the classifier when the GO hierarchy code the classifier is responsible for has been assigned in the previous step. Otherwise, the hierarchy code is not assigned.</p><p>We experimented with the following features. • GO hierarchy codes corresponding to the GO codes extracted from text: (e.g. BP);</p><p>• document section: e.g. title, introduction, results, figure etc.;</p><p>• number of previous assignments in MGI (before 2003) of a particular GO code to the target gene;</p><p>• number of previous assignments in MGI (before 2003) of a particular GO code to a gene from the same family as the target gene;</p><p>• number of previous assignments in LocusLink (before 2003) of a particular GO code to a human homolog of the target gene;</p><p>• number of previous assignments in LocusLink (before 2003) of a particular GO code to a human homolog of a gene from the family of the target gene;</p><p>• MeSH tree codes, cut at level 3 (e.g. F02.463.425);</p><p>• evidence codes keywords from a manually constructed list.</p><p>Most of the features were extracted from a window around the target gene (feature-dependent size).</p><p>We extracted the document sections from the SGML files (we do not allow our windows to cross the section boundaries). The reason to include the document sections as features is based on the observation that GO codes annotated to genes seem to be found primarily in titles, figure captions, and some particular sections (e.g. results and discussions).</p><p>The idea to look at the previous assignments to gene/family comes from the observation that the more often a particular GO code has been assigned in the past, the higher the likelihood that it will be assigned again. Similarly, homologous genes in mouse and human are likely to share the same functions, processes and components, i.e. to be assigned the same GO hierarchy codes. MeSH terms are generally among the best features for text classification tasks in the biomedical domain and proved to be useful in this case too. A description of our MeSH term identification module can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,462.92,232.55,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, for each evidence code, we manually constructed a list of relevant keywords. These were derived from the evidence codes definition found at the GO Web site<ref type="foot" coords="4,385.01,286.00,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and have been further augmented with related terms by a person with biomedical background. We also tried words/stems but these did not help and were not used in the final submission.</p><p>While gene families are already available online from MGI<ref type="foot" coords="4,331.53,352.98,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , they had limited coverage and were further restricted to mouse only. Instead, we extracted family information from LocusLink by searching for gene names and synonyms containing one of the strings: family, superfamily/super-family and subfamily/subfamily. For example, the gene olfactory receptor, family 5, subfamily V, member 1 is a member of subfamily V of the olfactory receptor family. The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13,456 different genes grouped into 3,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Results</head><p>We submitted five runs for the annotation task (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,339.34,547.56,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). To each document-gene pair we assigned GO hierarchy codes only. Three runs used an SVM classifier. The two runs without a classifier, biotext21 and biotext22, obtained F = 0.4041 (P = 0.2708, R = 0.7960) and respectively F = 0.4008 (P = 0.2658, R = 0.8141). The first run was obtained with the MGI subset and a window of 10 (2,700 GO codes).</p><p>The second run was obtained with the GOA subset (1,004 GO codes) and a window of 20.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,341.87,662.36,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,368.67,662.36,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>  GO codes annotated before 2003 and respectively the GO codes annotated to homologous genes in GOA database), while All GO denotes the set of all GO codes. In parenthesis, we show the F-measure computed with the exact GO codes, assuming the target goal was to assign the correct GO code for a gene, not just the MF, CC or BP code.</p><p>Several points are worth noting. First, we see a dramatic difference between the F-measure computed in terms of MF, CC, BP and the F-measure computed in terms of exact GO codes. This shows that while our system can assign a correct hierarchy code, it is generally not able to assign the correct GO code. Second, using a reduced set of codes yields a marginally better performance. Third, from the point of view of running time, it is also about twenty times faster to search for a reduced set of codes than to search for all the codes.</p><p>The performance on testing data was better than the performance on training data. A possible explanation for this could be the fact that the testing set was smaller (877 document-gene pairs compared to 1423 document-gene pairs in the training set). Filtering with κ generally helps though not significantly. Also, the results obtained with the MGI subset and with the GOA subset are comparable.</p><p>A data analysis performed after the TREC submission showed that we can improve the F-measure using the MeSH terms. Particularly, after finding a GO code in text, we eliminate it if we cannot find 50% of its tokens in the MeSH terms annotated to the document. Our assumption here is that the gene function has to be a major topic in the document. MeSH terms represent the major topics in the document, hence we eliminate the GO codes not found in the MeSH terms. Using the MeSH terms we improve our performance on the testing collection from 0.4041 to 0.4694 (obtained with the MGI subset and a window of 20).</p><p>We submitted three runs with the SVM classifier (see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,100.95,604.92,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Biotext23 and biotext25 used the GOA subset, while biotext24 used all.</p><p>For biotext23 and biotext24 we searched for features in a window of 200 words centered around the gene, while for biotext25 we searched in a window of 100 words. While we gain in precision (for example bio-text24 achieves a precision of 0.4452 compared to bio-text21 which obtains a precision of 0.2708), we lose a lot on recall and these runs are worse compared to the ones without the classifier. The best F obtained with a classifier is only 0.3367, whereas the best F obtained without the classifier is 0.4041.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Ad Hoc Retrieval Task</head><p>For the ad hoc retrieval task we used a databasecentered approach similar to what we submitted last year for TREC <ref type="bibr" coords="6,387.70,191.64,9.97,8.74" target="#b4">[7]</ref>. We experimented with several techniques for gene recognition and different MeSH <ref type="bibr" coords="6,340.87,215.55,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[4]</ref> sub-hierarchies.</p><p>In MeSH, each concept is assigned a unique identifier and one or more alphanumeric tree numbers (corresponding to particular positions in the hierarchy). For example, A (Anatomy), A01 Body Regions, A01.456 Head. In addition, each MeSH concept is assigned a semantic type, e.g., Enzyme, Mammal, Chemicals. For the ad hoc task we used the MeSH terms annotated to documents and the MeSH chemicals sematic type.</p><p>We processed the queries and extracted a variety of features including:</p><p>• GENE LOCUS: genes found by approximate matching to the LocusLink genes and synonyms;</p><p>• GENE YAGI: genes found using Yagi <ref type="bibr" coords="6,485.94,423.33,9.97,8.74" target="#b3">[6]</ref>;</p><p>• GENE: words looking like a gene/protein/chemical name found in the text (e.g. SLC40A1);</p><p>• FAMILY: family name inferred from the query text (using a pattern matching);</p><p>• FAMILY LOCUS: family names for the genes (automatically generated by processing the synonym names in LocusLink, as described above);</p><p>• MeSH: MeSH terms;</p><p>• ORGANISM MeSH: the organism name (inferred from MeSH).</p><p>For every type of feature we generated a complex sub-query, as follows <ref type="foot" coords="6,402.74,637.05,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Let G be the various forms of the feature and let LG be other lower-confidence rules for normalizing the feature names that have a higher rate of false positives (implemented only for LocusLink genes). The score of a document R given feature type f is computed as follows:</p><p>Score(R, f ) = the aggregated SUM over the result of the UNION operator GROUP BY document identifier of: Because of the lack of training topics with reliable reference judgement, we could not fine tune the feature type weights. The following weights were used in our official run:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="7,131.05,369.13,110.91,80.75">GENE LOCUS = 1 GENE = 0.6 GENE YAGI = 0.8 MeSH = 2 ORGANISM MeSH = 4 FAMILY = 3 FAMILY LOCUS = 3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Results</head><p>We submitted one official run for the ad-hoc task. The mean average precision (MAP) over the 50 topics was 0.1384, which is quite low. We did not produce additional unofficial runs, but we believe that the system suffered from the lack of proper training data for tuning the different weights. Fine-tuning the weights on the training data was one of the main reasons our system achieved high performance last year. Another limitation of the system was that we did not have a sub-query for terms that were not mapped to gene-names or MeSH terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">The Triage Task</head><p>For the triage task we analyzed the PubMed citations only; we did not use the full text, although we think doing so could have improved the results. We trained an SVM classifier using SVM-light <ref type="bibr" coords="7,262.44,724.00,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[12]</ref> with the following features:</p><p>• the words from the title, weighted by tf.idf for the entire collection, and normalized so that the weight vector sums to one (for use by the SVM classifier);</p><p>• the MeSH labels assigned to the citation, cut off at tree level 3;</p><p>• a nominal feature indicating if the article had been assigned a genre other than "Journal Article" (such as "Survey"), which can sometimes indicate negative evidence for curation;</p><p>• the DataBankName feature assigned to some PubMed entries, since those articles that have been assigned this feature often discuss a topic relevant to genomics and often indicate a positive curation decision.</p><p>In order to optimize the Normalized Utility (NU) measure used to assess the triage task, and because there were many more negative instances than positive, it was necessary to include documents with negative SVM scores in the result set. Experimentation on the training set indicated that this cutoff should be set to -0.9. However, when applied to the test set, the number of documents retrieved at this threshold seemed too large, so we decided to submit at larger cutoff scores of -0.7, -0.6, -0.5, -0.4, and -0.3. After receiving the test labels it was evident that we should have used the -0.9 cutoff determined experimentally, as that would have brought our NU score to 0.344, which is close to the track average. Our best official NU score was 0.32 using a cutoff of -0.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>For the annotation task we experimented with reduced sets of GO codes and filtered the GO codes using the κ coefficient. To improve precision we further filtered the GO codes using an SVM classifier. We obtained a marginally better performance with the reduced sets of GO codes versus the performance obtained with all the GO codes. Also, searching in text for only a subset of GO codes is about 20 times faster. Using the κ coefficient to eliminate codes that should not co-occur seems to improve performance slightly.</p><p>Unfortunately, while clearly helpful on the training data, the SVM classifier achieved a lower performance on the testing data. A possible explanation for this performance could be that the testing documents contained mostly new genes for which little is known. For a lot of them we did not have any synonyms available, i.e. we found far less instances of the target gene in text, which means far less features available to the classifier. In addition, some of our most important features were eliminated altogether: if the gene is new then we do not have previous assignments to it, there are no known homologous genes and we do not know its family. All these make the testing data look different from the training, which can be disastrous for a maximum margin classifier like SVM. Moreover, fewer windows means fewer possible GO categories proposed and thus less utility from filtering them.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,91.93,146.47,170.30,8.74;7,91.93,158.43,189.17,8.74;7,91.93,170.38,178.60,8.74;7,91.93,182.34,189.17,8.74;7,91.93,194.29,189.17,8.74;7,91.93,206.25,129.77,8.74;7,72.00,230.90,229.01,8.74;7,72.00,242.85,229.02,8.74;7,72.00,254.81,43.44,8.74;7,128.94,259.84,3.88,6.12;7,135.76,254.81,165.25,8.74;7,72.00,266.76,229.02,8.74;7,72.00,278.72,229.02,8.74;7,72.00,290.67,8.72,8.74"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) J * (G compared to terms in titles) (b) J * (LG compared to terms in abstracts) (c) K * (LG compared to terms in titles) (d) K * (LG compared to terms in abstracts) (e) L * (MeSH concepts compared to MeSH terms assigned to documents)where J = 1, K = 0.015, and L = 1.4 (determined experimentally).
