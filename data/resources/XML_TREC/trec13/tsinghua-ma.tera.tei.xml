<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This year, Tsinghua University Information Retrieval Group (THUIR) participated in the terabyte track of TREC for the first time. Since the document collection is as large as about 426G and we do not have super computers, our first and most import target is to complete the task in a reasonable low cost, both on the hardware system and time-consuming. This target was archived in such approaches: carefully data preprocess, data set reduction, optimization of algorithm and program. As the effect of the approaches, the task was completed in a normal high performance desktop PC with an indexing time not more than several ten hours and an acceptable retrieval time. Furthermore, the retrieval performance is not terrible. All experiments have been performed on TMiner IR system, developed by THUIR group last year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data preprocess</head><p>The data preprocess is mainly extracting text from html document and filter out all tags and scripts. We use a perl script that call HTML Parser to perform the extraction <ref type="bibr" coords="1,348.19,415.32,11.59,9.02">[1]</ref>. The .gov2 files were gunziped and directly piped to the perl script without saving to harddisk to reduce disk space use. The data size after preprocess is about 138G, less than 1/3 of original data set.</p><p>Another work of preprocess is extraction of anchor text from html document. Then the anchor text were sorted according to the link-to documents. The size of total anchor text is about 3.9G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data set reduction and reform</head><p>The data set reduction is achieved by replace the original document by its abstract. The abstract of html files were formed with some key field of the document. These fields include tile, text with bold, italic or head attribute. The abstract of PDF files, DOC files and PS files were made by simply take the first two hundred words of the document. The data set size was reduced from 138G to 22G after such process.</p><p>We used both full text and abstracts in the experiments. In some experiments, anchor text were merged to the link-to documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Indexing and retrieval</head><p>Since the hardware limit, the whole data set was divided into several parts. Individual indexes were built on each sub-collection and then merged finally. Stop-words filtering and stemming technology were applied. The index was compressed to reduce size. The size of full-text index is about 121G and the size of abstract index is about 16G.</p><p>In this retrieval, both short query and long query were used. BM2500 retrieval formula was used to * Supported by by Chinese National Key Foundation Research &amp; Development Plan (973) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.81,751.23,23.39,8.10;1,90.00,761.55,73.26,8.10">(Grant No.2004CB318108)</ref> and Chinese Natural Science Foundation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,314.77,761.55,162.83,8.10">(Grants No. 60223004, 60321002, 60303005)</ref>. calculate the similarity between query topic and documents.</p></div>
