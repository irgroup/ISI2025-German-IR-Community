<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The TREC 2004 Terabyte Track evaluated information retrieval in largescale text collections, using a set of 25 million documents (426 GB). This paper gives an overview of our experiences with this collection and describes Amberfish, the text retrieval software used for the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Preface</head><p>This is the first year of the Terabyte Track and the first time we have participated directly in the TREC conference. It is also the first time that the Amberfish software (etymon.com/tr.html) has been used in TREC. Our goals for this ambitious track were simply to complete the task and to gain some rudimentary experience with evaluation and the Terabyte collection.</p><p>This paper presents a summary of the Amberfish software followed by a brief discussion of this year's Terabyte Track.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Amberfish</head><p>Amberfish is open source text retrieval software developed by the author starting in 1998 and distributed by Etymon Systems, Inc. The project was based on lessons learned from previous implementation experiences with <ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.68,564.24,64.78,13.15">Isearch (1994)</ref> and freeWAIS (1992) at the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR). Isearch was the search component of Isite, an open source Z39.50 implementation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,261.08,604.92,11.85,13.15" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,275.32,604.92,7.90,13.15" target="#b4">5]</ref>, and freeWAIS was an open source version of WAIS <ref type="bibr" coords="1,155.72,618.48,11.49,13.15" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. More recently, Amberfish has been coupled with GIR <ref type="bibr" coords="1,417.53,618.48,12.69,13.15" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Z39.50 for experiments in distributed searching.</p><p>The core of Amberfish provides a set of general purpose indexing and searching operations, with conventional support for Boolean queries, right truncation, phrase searching, relevance ranking, multiple documents per file, incremental indexing, and stemming. Some novel features are indexing of semi-structured text (XML), structured queries for selecting field path subtrees, hierarchical results showing field relationships, and automatic searching across multiple indexes.</p><p>The software consists of a C/C++ library and a Unix-like command line interface on the front end. The central data structures are a dictionary and linked postings lists <ref type="bibr" coords="2,186.58,211.92,11.58,13.15" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, with a simple prefix B-tree used to store the inverted file. The postings can be converted to sequential lists with an optional second indexing pass. Several speed optimizations are used in indexing, such as merge update of the B-tree <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.05,252.60,11.58,13.15" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Additional files optionally store word positions (for phrase/proximity) and field structures, both associated with individual postings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Terabyte Track</head><p>The first few weeks of handling the Terabyte collection primarily entailed discovering all of the approaches that were not going to work. The collection consisted of 25 million web pages from the .GOV domain, or about 426 GB. The initial plan was to process the collection using HTML-to-XML conversion software such as HTML Tidy and html2text, so that the structure could be indexed by Amberfish. However, the software was unable to convert successfully more than 99% of the documents. With limited time remaining and in order to avoid confusion, it was determined to index the documents as plain text, although this unfortunately meant that tag element and attribute names would be indexed as words. In addition, the relevance scoring function for "bag of words" queries was not implemented in time for submitting query runs. As a result, the plan changed to finishing the task and leaving evaluation until next year.</p><p>Three runs were submitted. The first was produced by the simple union of documents matching title terms from the topic. The second was a simple intersection. The third was a combination of union and intersection, with results from the intersection weighted more heavily. The results were poor enough that they need not be included here. In particular the lack of attention to word proximity seems to have hurt precision. However, this could also be a result of our incomplete scoring function, which in effect was a very simplified variation of NTC for document weights with no term weighting.</p><p>Although a Porter stemmer was used, no stopwords were removed. Even so the indexing process was very fast, under 45 hours with fairly modest hardware: 2 GB RAM on a Xeon 3.06 GHz system, storing 279 GB of index files. (The system had quite a bit more memory which was not used in these experiments.) The index was partitioned into 27 subindexes and the searches distributed over them.</p><p>All indexing and searching was done using the available "stock" version of Amberfish, which includes options for outputting results in TREC-run format. It is hoped that prospective participants, especially students, will find the software to be a useful tool while learning about TREC.</p></div>		</body>
