<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the methods we developed for the three tasks of the TREC Genomics Track, i.e., ad hoc retrieval, triage, and annotation tasks. For the ad hoc retrieval task, we used the classic vector space model and studied the use of query expansion and pseudorelevance feedback. Our submitted runs obtained a MAP of 0.183. For the triage task, we adopted a na√Øve Bayes classifier trained on MeSH terms and used gene names as filters to rule out false positives. The obtained normalized utility score was 0.435. For the annotation task, we focused on document representation and applied a variant of the kNN classifiers. One of our submitted runs produced an F 1 score of 0.561, ranking first out of 36 runs submitted for the annotation task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The volume of the biomedical literature is enormous and has been rapidly growing. For example, MED-LINE, a bibliographic database in the biomedical domain, currently contains over 13 million records and 2000 records are added daily. This rich resource of knowledge has motivated various research themes in the area of information retrieval (IR) for realizing effective information access.</p><p>To foster the IR and related research, specifically targeting biomedical text, the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) launched the genomics track in 2003 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,278.75,631.26,11.59,9.82" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which attracted the second largest group of participants among all the tracks. This year, the genomics track had two primary tasks: ad hoc retrieval and categorization tasks. The latter mimics some parts of Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database curation processes that are currently carried out by human experts, and consists of two subtasks, i.e., triage and annotation, as described shortly.</p><p>The following sections report our proposed methods and the results for the ad hoc retrieval, triage, and annotation tasks in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Ad Hoc Retrieval Task 2.1 Overview</head><p>This is a conventional ad hoc retrieval task targeting the biomedical literature. Participants were provided with 50 topics, and for each topic, they were required to retrieve a set of relevant documents sorted according to the estimated relevance. The topics were collected through interviews with biologists in order to capture the real-world information need. Each topic consisted of three fields, i.e., title, information need, and context along with topic ID. An example topic is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,334.54,508.60,4.09,9.82" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID:</head><p>51 TITLE:</p><p>pBR322 used as a gene vector NEED:</p><p>Find information about base sequences and restriction maps in plasmids that are used as gene vectors. CONTEXT: The researcher would like to manipulate the plasmid by removing a particular gene and needs the original base sequence or restriction map information of the plasmid. The data set used for this task is 10 years' worth of MEDLINE data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.32,89.05,24.63,9.82">(1994)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(1995)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(1996)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(1997)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(1998)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(1999)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.95,89.05,4.93,9.82">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.88,89.05,24.63,9.82">(2003)</ref>, containing 4,591,008 bibliographic records. Incidentally, five sample topics and the corresponding list of relevant documents (not complete) were provided for the purpose of system design and tuning.</p><p>We submitted two runs (lga1 and lga2) for this task; only the difference between them is that lga1 used pseudo-relevance feedback, while lga2 did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Methods</head><p>Framework The vector space model and the TFIDF term weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.76,248.05,18.18,9.82" target="#b12">[13]</ref> were adopted as the basic framework. In addition, the use of query expansion and pseudo-relevance feedback was explored. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,271.77,275.15,5.46,9.82" target="#fig_1">2</ref> depicts the overview of our retrieval system. The following paragraphs describe the components of our IR system in more detail.</p><p>NP extraction Given a topic, the system first extracted noun phrases (NPs) from the TITLE and NEED fields as a potential query terms using a generalpurpose parser <ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.67,574.86,11.59,9.82" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The CONTEXT field and other categories of words (e.g., verbs) were not used since they tended to degrade the system performance on the tuning data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query expansion</head><p>The extracted NPs were then expanded using three sources of information to form the final query. Firstly, a gene name dictionary was consulted to find synonyms. The dictionary was compiled from the SWISS-PROT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.53,698.99,18.18,9.82" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and LocusLink <ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.02,698.99,18.18,9.82" target="#b11">[12]</ref> databases and contained 493,473 records. Each record has a gene/protein name as the keyword and lists its synonyms such as aliases and symbols where no disambiguation was done for multi-sense names. Secondly, a set of hand-crafted rules was applied to generate name variants. These rules were designed to tolerate minor difference (e.g., existence/absence of symbols and spaces) between strings. Lastly, for each of the potential query terms, the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) vocabulary was searched for the synonyms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query generation</head><p>Since the number of the potential query terms (phrases) collected through the preceding steps can be quite large, they were filtered based on document frequency (DF) and relative frequency ratio (RFR) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.74,267.85,12.72,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for efficiency. Terms with high DF and/or low RFR are thought to be too general and discarded. Document frequency of term t, denoted as DF(t), is the number of documents containing t within the test collection. RFR(t) is a ratio of relative frequency of t in the test collection to that of t in the other collection from a different domain. RFR can be used to discover terms characteristic of a corpus when compared to another corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.29,376.25,11.59,9.82" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For this experiment, we used 5,986 abstracts from Inspec,<ref type="foot" coords="2,442.90,387.84,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_0">1</ref> a bibliographic database for physics, engineering, computing, etc. The thresholds for DF and RFR were empirically set to 30,000 and 5, respectively, based on a preliminary look at the tuning data. Finally, terms which went through the filters were concatenated by Boolean OR operators, forming the final query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search and ranking</head><p>Five textual fields (Article-Title, AbstractText, DescriptorName, Quali-fierName, and NameOfSubstance) in the MEDLINE data were indexed in advance. The search module exhaustively retrieved the documents which contained any terms/phrases composing the query. As for ranking the retrieved documents, TFIDF and cosine similarity were used. The four fields of the topics were not distinguished in searching and scoring in the experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pseudo-relevance feedback</head><p>The pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) module assumed the top n ranked documents to be relevant and used significant terms in the documents to refine the query. As a measure of significance, we used TFIDF values. For each document, m terms with highest TFIDF were sent back to the query generation module to be considered for inclusion in the refined query. This process can be repeated arbitrary k times. For the submitted run (lga1), we experimentally set n = m = 10 and k = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Results</head><p>We submitted two sets of results, labeled as lga1 and lga2; the former used pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), while the latter did not. The mean average precision (MAP) were 0.183 for lga1 and 0.175 for lga2; both were found lower than the mean 0.207 of all the 37 submitted runs. We conducted additional experiments to examine the usefulness of each system component and the effect of some parameters. Through the experiments, we observed that:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Using the CONTEXT field, PRF (k=3), and query expansion improved the performance in MAP by 24%, 19%, and 8%, respectively, as compared to the case where they were not used.</p><p>‚Ä¢ As expected, terms/phrases with high DF values (more than 1000) did not contribute to the performance (at least in our framework). Thus, they may be safely removed in forming queries.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Contrary to our expectation, thresholding on RFR degraded MAP by 9%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Triage Task</head><p>The triage task for the TREC 2004 Genomics track asks a simple, but very important question. We are presented with a large set of articles and asked to determine which articles should be considered for further curation of genes or gene products in relation to mouse genomics research. The human eye and brain have been the data processing tools for curation in the past, but this problem can be abstracted to the computational issue of text categorization, or more specifically, binary text classification.</p><p>There are many different approaches that can be taken for this task. There has been a great deal published on techniques that implement machine learning, clustering, and filtering techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="3,474.91,75.51,16.73,9.82" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which all address different levels of the text categorization problem. Each of these techniques has been shown to have strengths and weaknesses, with some outperforming others in various tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,422.71,129.70,11.59,9.82" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It has become our job as researchers and TREC participants to identify the best technique for this particular task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Overview</head><p>There was a great deal of time dedicated to exploring different categorization techniques for the triage task. After experimenting with support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, various term filters, and na√Øve Bayesian classifiers, it was determined that the best approach for our group was to implement a na√Øve Bayesian classifier, in addition to a filter aimed at the genes in an article.</p><p>Our group submitted two runs to the 2004 triage task for the TREC conference and results will be discussed in section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Feature Selection</head><p>Several different techniques were used to select and test feature sets. For the na√Øve Bayesian classifier, there were three different sets of features tested. We looked at a document frequency (DF) set of stemmed terms, a chi-squared set of stemmed terms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,483.23,477.44,16.73,9.82" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the set of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for each document. We received the best results, in terms of recall and precision, from the collection of all the MeSH terms within the training set, so this was the set of features used for the classifier.</p><p>The MeSH terms were collected via a web crawler, implemented in Perl, which takes a list of PubMed IDs (PMIDs) and would search the NCBI website with the assistance of NCBI's Entrez Programming Utilities (eutils). <ref type="foot" coords="3,340.97,611.43,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_1">2</ref>The Gene filter required a different set of features, which for each article, is defined as the set of genes contained in each article.</p><p>The first step in identifying the genes was to clean the data. A file was created for each article from the train-ing and test sets, which contained only the text from the abstract and body of the article by parsing out any unnecessary data, where all of the XML tags were removed.</p><p>Next, YAGI (Yet Another Gene Identifier) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,255.72,130.47,18.18,9.82" target="#b15">[16]</ref> was applied to each article to identify all the genes within an article.</p><p>After the features for each article were properly chosen, the classifier could be trained and tested, and the filter applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Na√Øve Bayesian Classifier</head><p>The na√Øve Bayesian classifier is a simple classification model that takes into account conditional probabilities based on Bayes' Theorem. This model uses a supervised training data set to calculate the necessary probabilities and can then be applied to a test data set to classify documents.</p><p>Conceptually, we can think of the classification task as the following conditional probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,147.47,376.09,146.68,12.65">p(C|F 1 ...F n )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where, C is a class or category and (F 1 ...F n ) is a set of features.</p><p>The classes for the triage task are simply the set {pass, f ail}, where the document passes to be further curated, or fails and is not considered for curation. The features represent the MeSH terms.</p><p>We can now apply Bayes' Theorem to the conditional probability (Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,182.57,501.11,4.09,9.82" target="#formula_0">1</ref>)) and derive the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,101.85,525.98,192.27,27.52">p(C|F 1 ...F n ) = p(C)p(F 1 ...F n |C) p(F 1 ...F n )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Ultimately, we are only interested in the numerator of equation 2, which is the joint probability. We can ignore the denominator of the equation, as C is not a parameter, and over the entire set of documents, the p(F 1 ...F n ) can be thought of as a constant. We can then rewrite the joint probability, as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,146.59,656.04,147.56,12.65">p(C, F 1 ...F n )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>With the joint probability, we are still carrying along the conditional probability for set {F 1 ...F n }, so by repeatedly applying the definition of the conditional prob-ability, we derive a series of equations as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,334.42,96.52,219.34,78.20">p(C, F 1 ...F n ) = p(C)p(F 1 ...F n |C) = p(C)p(F 1 |C)p(F 2 ...F n |C, F 1 ) = p(C)p(F 1 |C)p(F 2 |C, F 1 )p(F 3 ...F n |C, F 1 , F 2 ) = ...<label>(4</label></formula><p>) So far the idea of "na√Øve" from the na√Øve Bayesian classifier has not come into play, however, mathematically this is an important aspect of the classifier and will now be applied. "na√Øve" refers to the assumption that all features within the set {F 1 ...F n } are independent, where F i F j . When this is true for each feature, the probability of each feature does not depend on the presence or absence of any other feature.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,391.57,295.01,166.46,12.65">p(F i |C, F j ) = p(F i |C)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>After applying this concept to Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,511.72,320.37,3.86,9.82" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), we can rewrite the joint probability as <ref type="bibr" coords="4,452.49,333.92,11.82,9.82" target="#b4">[5]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,326.23,355.64,231.79,62.38">p(C, F 1 ...F n ) = p(C)p(F 1 |C)p(F 2 |C)...p(F n |C) OR p(C, F 1 ...F n ) = p(C) n i=1 p(F i |C)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The above explanation of a na√Øve Bayesian classifier has been implemented in the Perl module Algorithm:NaiveBayes. <ref type="foot" coords="4,399.38,453.55,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_2">3</ref> This module was used in conjunction with Perl code to train the classifier using the articles in the training set and their associated MeSH terms. The trained classifier was then applied to the test data set, which returned a set of data that will be passed on to the Gene Filter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Gene Filter</head><p>The gene filter was used solely to eliminate false positives. The na√Øve Bayesian classifier returned a large number of documents with high recall, but with low precision.</p><p>Often times, there are a large number of genes, and/or gene products, that are mentioned within an article related to molecular biology. Also, research articles tend to describe a very specific area of research, where a specific group of genes, proteins, DNA, or RNA are mentioned. This phenomena can be exploited, by looking for correlations between the genes that are mentioned in the articles with curation information, as compared to the genes that are mentioned in the articles that are not passed on for curation. Trends in genes and gene products that are present in articles passed on for curation gives us another measure for the triage task.</p><p>The gene filter counts the gene products and genes, which will be referred to simply as genes, and are identified by the inserted YAGI tags, &lt;GENE&gt;&lt;/GENE&gt;. This is done for all articles within the training set. The set of genes collected from the entire set of articles are then separated based on their triage classification. The set of genes present in the articles deemed worthy of further curation are noted G p , while the set of genes present in the articles which are not taken for further curation are noted G n . The genes that are in union with set G p and G n are eliminated from each set. This gives us a unique set of genes that only appear in the set of articles that will be used for further curation, noted G pu , and a set of unique genes that only appear in the set of articles that are not used for further curation, noted G nu .</p><p>Set G nu was then ranked, and if a gene occurred in more than a certain percentage of the negatively curatable articles, it was added to the final gene set, noted G f . The percentage used in determining if a gene should be included in set G f was adjusted for our two submitted runs. Set G f was used to eliminate false positive articles from the MeSH filtered set of articles. An article was eliminated from the final set of articles if a gene from set G f was present in the article.</p><p>Overall, after applying the na√Øve Bayesian classifier and the gene filter, we derive a set of articles that were classified as being of interest to further curate by MeSH terms and genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>Overall, the use of a na√Øve Bayesian classifier and gene filter performed relatively well, as compared to the other 57 triage task submissions by TREC participants. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,112.29,631.26,5.46,9.82" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the best, median, and worst performances of the entire group of 59 submissions, as well as our submissions. The main measure for this task was the normalized utility score, which takes into account the true and false positive articles in a submitted run. Our first run performed well, and our normalized utility was 0.434, where the best performance was a score of 0.651 and the median performance was 0.342. Our second run did not perform as well as the first, but still managed to perform at the median with a score of 0.342.</p><p>There was only one difference between the first and the second run, which deals with the gene filter. Both runs were classified through the na√Øve Bayesian classifier using the same set of MeSH terms and set of training articles. However, the gene filter for each run was adjusted, in regards to the percentage of genes that were included in set G f (Section 3.2.3). Set G f was used to eliminate false positive articles from the filtered set of articles from the na√Øve Bayesian classifier and the percentage of genes used in the first run was much stricter than the percentage of genes used in the second run. For the first run, a gene needed to occur in at least 10% of the negatively curatable articles to be included in set G f , while a gene needed to be present in only 5% of the negatively curatable articles to be included in set G f for run 2.</p><p>By increasing the amount of genes that are used to eliminate an article from the final run, we are increasing the amount of true positive articles that are eliminated, which is what happened in our second run. The first run had an appropriate amount of genes to eliminate false positives, while not eliminating true positives.</p><p>Overall, we feel that our solution of using a na√Øve Bayesian classifier and gene filter to the 2004 Genomics Triage Task was a success. Both of our submitted runs normalized utility scores were above the median of the 57 TREC run submissions, higlighted by our first run score, which was well above the median score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Annotation Task</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Overview</head><p>The goal of the annotation task is to assign GO hierarchy and evidence codes to a given article, gene pair. There are three hierarchy codes and 12 evidence codes possibly assigned. <ref type="foot" coords="6,134.25,160.35,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_3">4</ref> For this task, we were allowed to submit results only for hierarchy code assignment and for hierarchy and evidence code assignment. Hereafter, we call the former Task1 and the latter Task2.</p><p>For the data sets, 504 and 378 full-text articles in SGML format were provided as the training and test data, respectively. Before use, they were automatically converted to XML format by a UNIX command SGML2XML. In addition, the character entities representing Greek alphabets (e.g., &amp;agr;) were converted to the corresponding English spellings (e.g., alpha).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Methods</head><p>Framework As in the triage task, the annotation task is a classification problem, where GO hierarchy codes or combinations of hierarchy and evidence codes are regarded as classes. For this task, we adopted kNN classifiers which have been reported as one of the best classifiers for text categorization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,182.94,416.26,16.73,9.82" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. To apply the classifiers, each article, gene pair was first represented by a term weight vector. Since an entire article is not necessarily relevant to the particular gene, we used only the paragraphs mentioning the gene name. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,255.46,470.46,5.46,9.82" target="#fig_2">3</ref> depicts the flow of the processes.</p><p>Finding synonyms First, aliases and abbreviations of the given gene name were searched for in the article itself. Specifically, we looked at &lt;KEYWORD&gt; and &lt;GLOSSARY&gt; fields that may explicitly define a pair of original name and corresponding abbreviation. <ref type="foot" coords="6,265.83,571.44,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_4">5</ref> We also examined the use of body text because gene name abbreviations often appear immediately following the original names <ref type="bibr" coords="6,122.18,614.04,16.73,9.82" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, it slightly degraded the classification performance and thus was disabled for our submitted runs. Additionally, the gene name dictionary used in the ad hoc retrieval task was consulted for finding synonyms. Hereafter, "gene names" refers to the original names, aliases, and abbreviations for short.  Locating gene names in the given article Next step is to find text fragments mentioning the gene in question within the paired article, since the entire article may not be necessarily relevant to the particular gene.</p><p>As gene names generally have many variants due to the inconsistent use of symbols, spaces, etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,496.82,398.33,11.59,9.82" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, both gene names and text were preprocessed as follows, so as to tolerate such minor difference:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Replace symbols with spaces</p><p>‚Ä¢ Insert space between different character types, such as alphabets and numerals (e.g., Diet1 ‚Üí Diet 1)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Insert space between Greek alphabets and other words (e.g., NF-kappaB ‚Üí NF kappa B)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Lowercase all characters Then, each paragraph in the article was checked if it was likely to contain any of the gene names associated with the gene. Note that section titles were appended to each paragraph within the sections since they were often found to be descriptive. In addition, if the paragraph referred to figures and/or tables for the first time, the captions were also appended to it. For each gene name and each context mentioning any word of the gene name, the word-overlap score defined below was computed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overlap(gene, context)</head><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="7,188.03,95.29,106.09,26.52">= M -Œ± ‚Ä¢ U N + Œ≤ (7)</formula><p>where M and U denote the numbers of matching and unmatching words, respectively; Œ± is a penalty for unmatching words (set to 0.3); N is the number of words composing the gene name; and Œ≤ penalizes shorter gene names (set to 2). If any of the scores associated with a paragraph exceeded a predefined threshold (set to 0.3), all terms in the paragraph were added to the feature set representing the article, gene pair. The values of the parameters were determined based on our preliminary experiments on the training data.</p><p>Obtaining MeSH terms For each input article, all the associated MeSH terms were obtained from MED-LINE using Entrez Utilities, <ref type="foot" coords="7,178.67,310.74,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_5">6</ref> irrespective of the genes that were paired with the article. These MeSH terms were also added to the feature set representing the article, gene pairs. However, a special symbol MESH+ was concatenated to each MeSH term in order to distinguish MeSH from other terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feature selection</head><p>The features (terms) extracted in the previous steps were preprocessed by stopword removal based on the PubMed stopword list <ref type="foot" coords="7,242.42,435.40,3.99,7.18" target="#foot_6">7</ref> and stemming. We used Lovins stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="7,209.69,450.89,12.72,9.82" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for our official runs but also examined Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="7,232.85,464.45,18.18,9.82" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and nonstemming. For feature selection, we used chi-square statistic <ref type="bibr" coords="7,90.07,491.55,18.18,9.82" target="#b17">[18]</ref> defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="7,70.82,512.70,219.06,26.64">œá 2 (t, c) = N(AD -CB) 2 (A + C) (B + D) (A + B) (C + D) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="7,289.88,522.03,4.24,9.82">)</formula><p>where A is the number of documents containing term t in class c, B is the number of documents containing t in classes other than c, C is the number of documents not containing t in c, D is the number of documents not containing t in classes other than c, and N is the total number of documents. For a given term t, the chisquare statistic was computed for each class (either a hierarchy code or a combination of hierarchy and evidence codes depending on the task). The maximum score was taken as the chi-square statistic for term t, that is, œá 2 (t) = max i œá 2 (t, c i ). Only the top n terms with higher chi-square statistics were used for the following processes. For the official runs, n was set to 2000 and 3000 for Task1 and Task2, respectively, based on the preliminary experiments.</p><p>Data manipulation Each article, gene pair was represented by a term vector using the term set obtained through the preceding steps. As term weighting schemes, we compared TFIDF and TFCHI as well as raw term frequency (TF). The following shows the definitions of TFIDF and TFCHI of term t in document d.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="7,332.92,275.75,225.08,38.95">TFIDF(t, d) = (1 + log(TF(t, d)) ‚Ä¢ N DF(t) TFCHI(t, d) = (1 + log(TF(t, d)) ‚Ä¢ log(œá 2 (t))<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The latter scheme, TFCHI, is an instance of supervised term weighting schemes proposed by Debole and Sebastiani <ref type="bibr" coords="7,387.37,356.25,11.59,9.82" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It takes into account pre-labeled class information in the training data and re-uses statistics computed in the feature selection step (chi-square statistics in this case) in place of IDF. Since TFCHI produced slightly better F-scores than the others in our preliminary experiments, it was used for our official runs. In addition, singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref type="bibr" coords="7,349.49,451.09,12.72,9.82" target="#b1">[2]</ref> was applied to compensate for the small size of the training data. The number of singular values used for reconstructing the matrix (i.e., the number of dimensions after reduction) was empirically set to 50 and 70 for Task1 and Task2, respectively.</p><p>Classification Using the matrix created by the procedure above, each input (a pair of article and gene) was classified into one or more predefined classes by a variant of kNN classifiers. First, the input article, gene was represented by a term weight vector following the same procedure illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,475.02,604.16,5.46,9.82" target="#fig_2">3</ref> except for feature selection and data manipulation. The features previously identified on the training data were used as filters and the other terms not found in the feature set were discarded. Then, the remaining terms were weighted by the same scheme as applied to the training data, but global term weights (either IDF or CHI) were obtained from the training data as we were not allowed to use those statistics from the test data. After that, the input term vector was transformed into lower dimensions (50 for Task1 or 70 for Task2) using the matrix of singular vectors computed earlier on the training data. Given an input vector, the (original) kNN algorithm finds k neighbors most similar to the input among the training data, and aggregates similarity scores associated with the k neighbors for each class. If these scores are greater than per-class thresholds, the corresponding classes are assigned to the input. We further weighted the aggregated scores by the number of the k neighbors having class c. Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="8,161.71,211.00,18.18,9.82" target="#b9">(10)</ref> shows the scoring scheme given class c and input vector v.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="8,80.95,248.71,208.63,23.59">Score(c, v) = i sim(v, n c,i ) √ó |n c | -t c (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11" coords="8,289.58,250.53,4.55,9.82">)</formula><p>where n c is the k nearest neighbors having class c, |n c | is the number of n c , t c is a per-class threshold, and sim(‚Ä¢) returns the cosine similarity between the arguments. Threshold t c was optimized so as to maximize the micro-averaged F-score over all the training data. The use of |n c | intends to give higher weights to classes more frequent in the k neighbors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results and discussions</head><p>We submitted two sets of results for each of the subtasks. They were denoted as lgcad for Task1 (hierarchy code assignment) and lgcab for Task2 (hierarchy and evidence code assignment). The only difference is that lgcad1 and lgcab1 used SVD for feature space dimensionality reduction, while lgcad2 and lgcab2 did not. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,118.14,502.45,5.46,9.82" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes the results for the submitted runs. After submission, however, we found a few bugs related to approximate word matching and term weighting in our codes. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,184.21,543.10,5.46,9.82" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents the results produced by the corrected codes.  Specifically, we examined the effects of the following factors:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Threshold for approximate word matching in identifying relevant paragraphs (see Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="8,537.37,264.53,8.28,9.82" target="#formula_10">10</ref>)):</p><p>We tested 0 (meaning to use all the paragraphs irrespective of gene name occurrences), 0.3 (our default), 0.5 (more restrictive). In addition, exact word matching (denoted as "Exact") was tested instead of approximate word matching.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Use of the gene name dictionary: Our system was tested with/without the gene name dictionary.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Use of section titles: Same as above.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Use of MeSH terms: Same as above.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Stemming algorithms: Porter's and Lovins' algorithms were compared as well as non-stemming.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Term weighting schemes: Raw term frequencies (TF), TFIDF, and TFCHI were compared.</p><p>‚Ä¢ kNN scoring: The original and our proposed variant were compared.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Use of SVD for dimensionality reduction: Our system was tested with/without SVD.</p><p>In the experiments, only the factor under consideration was changed with other features remaining the same as lgcad1 or lgcab1. Notice that, however, the per-class threshold t c for kNN was optimized for each setting in order to compare the best possible F 1 scores under different settings.

In addition, TFCHI worked notably better than TFIDF for Task2, partly supporting the idea of the supervised term weighting schemes <ref type="bibr" coords="10,185.92,413.67,12.72,9.82" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that class-based term weights (e.g., chi-square statistics as used for this work) is more appropriate for classification.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The different kNN scoring schemes had little effect for both tasks.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The use of SVD marginally improved classification in F 1 , especially for Task2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Summary</head><p>We took part in the three tasks of the Genomics Track. For the ad hoc retrieval task, we adopted the vector space model and applied several existing IR techniques including noun phrase extraction, query expansion, and pseudo-relevance feedback. Our submitted run using all the features obtained 0.183 MAP. For the triage task, we applied the na√Øve Bayes classifier trained solely on MeSH terms and obtained a normalized utility score of 0.434. Additionally, we examined the use of gene names as a filter to rule out false positives, which, however, deteriorated the performance to 0.342 contrary to our expectation. Lastly, for the annotation task, we represented each input (i.e., a pair of article and gene) by a set of terms extracted from text fragments mentioning the gene in question, where we paid special attention to dealing with various forms of gene synonyms and variants. Then, we applied a kNN classifier to assign hierarchy codes and optionally evidence codes.</p><p>Our submitted runs achieved an F 1 of 0.561 for hierarchy code annotation and 0.422 for hierarchy plus evidence code annotation, which were found to be the best scores among all the participants. Further experiments showed that approximate gene name matching and the gene name dictionary contributed the most to the performance, followed by the use of SVD and the term weighting schemes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,317.88,710.18,240.21,9.82"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example topic for the ad hoc retrieval task.</figDesc></figure>
