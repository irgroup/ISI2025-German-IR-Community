<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>TREC 2015 is the second year that the Clinical Decision Support Track is running. The track's goal is to investigate techniques for linking medical cases to biomedical articles relevant for patient care. In other words, the track's challenge is to retrieve for a given case report full-text biomedical articles that answer questions related to several types of clinical information needs. This year there were two tasks (A and B) in contrast with the 2014 track which only had one task. Each task consists of 30 topics that are equally separated into three types: diagnosis, test, and treatment. Each topic, apart from the type, consists of a description and a summary that represent a medical case (or synonymously "case report"). Task A was exactly the same with 2014's task, and task B additionally provided a diagnosis field for the treatment and test topics. Based on the type of a topic, the clinical questions that we had to answer with relevant articles (a ranked list of 1000 documents) and accordingly with the topic's type are: "What is the patient's diagnosis", "What tests should the patient receive?" and "How should the patient be treated?".</p><p>Regarding the corpus/collection of biomedical articles, the track provides a subset of articles from PubMed 1 . This subset consists of open-access full-text biomedical articles that are provided by the PubMed Central 2 (PMC). A snapshot of this subset was obtained on January 21, 2014 and contains a total of 733,138 articles. The same snapshot was used in both tracks of 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our methodology for pre-processing and indexing the articles. Our proposed query construction methods are presented in Section 3. Our submitted runs and the o cial results of TREC Clinical Decision Support Track are described in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preprocessing and Indexing</head><p>In this section, we discuss in detail the pre-processing and indexing methods we employed in order to create our indices of articles for our experiments. Our goal was to build two di↵erent types of indices for our retrieval techniques that are presented in the next section. These two type of indices are:</p><p>(a) Dedicated indices per type of clinical question based on study designs: This idea to build indices per type of clinical question is based on the assumption that particular types of medical studies are appropriate to answer the di↵erent types of clinical questions. For this reason, we tried to classify the biomedical articles into particular study designs and to link these classes to the di↵erent types of clinical questions.</p><p>(b) General index for all clinical questions: This type of index consists of all the biomedical articles and it is used in order to be possible to compare our results with the type (a) of indices.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,137.65,371.92,4.98,9.52" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an overview of our preprocessing and indexing procedures in order to build these two types of indices. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,271.55,383.87,3.87,9.52" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, in both types of indices we exclude all the articles that did not have body (full-text), e.g. only abstracts or some articles with copyrighted contents. Thus, the remaining documents for indexing are in total 642,250 articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Indices of Type (a)</head><p>In order to classify the articles, we introduce the "EDDA Study Designs and Publications" (EDDA) ontology 3 that is based on research described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,314.24,466.01,9.96,9.52" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This ontology gives terminology of study designs and publication types, and in our case we decided to only focus on the study designs that represent the majority of di↵erent categories of medical studies. The defined categories of studies in version 1.3 of the ontology are 172 categories (including subcategories) that are enriched with synonym terms from MeSH, NCI Thesaurus (NCIT), and Emtree, the controlled vocabularies for MEDLINE, the National Cancer Institute, and Embase, respectively.</p><p>The list of these studies was given to a medical expert who was requested to classify each study design as "good" or "bad" for the three types of clinical questions (diagnosis, test and treatment). Subsequently, the results of this process were used to generate "good" and "bad" queries per type of clinical questions. The good query consists of study designs, as phrases or terms, expanded with their synonyms where the doctor gave positive answer for a particular clinical question type and the bad query has the opposite study designs. An example of a good and a bad query for diagnosis using the Indri Query Language <ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.84,609.48,10.51,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is: Bad Query: #combine(&lt;#1(animal study) #1(animal experiment)&gt; • • • &lt;#1(in vivo study)&gt;) In the previous queries, the expression &lt; • • • &gt; defines a list of synonyms terms, the expression #1(aaa bbbb) matches "aaa bbbb" as an exact phrase and the expression #2(aaa bbbb) matches "aaa ⇤ bbbb" (where ⇤ is any word or null). In order to avoid some fault detections of bad documents, we use stricter matching expression (#1) for phrases in bad queries than the expression (#2) in good queries.</p><p>Then, the generated queries are used to retrieve the PubMed Central IDs (PMCIDs) of all the documents that match with the queries. For the "bad" queries, we use an index that consists of titles, abstracts and keywords, and for the "good" queries we additionally use the section of methods. The extraction of methods' section is achieved in some cases because this section is explicitly defined as 'methods' in the XML files of articles and in some other cases because we detect the term 'method' in the title of sections. We use this variation in the indices for the "good" and "bad" queries in order to avoid some fault detections of bad documents from the methods' sections because in the methodology of an article is possible to describe that the presented study is based on other previous, for example, animal studies.</p><p>We used the Indri v5.5 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,214.19,615.77,9.96,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as search engine and indexing builder, the indexing of articles is performed using the default settings of this version, except that we enable the Krovetz stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,506.92,627.73,9.96,9.52" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and the ranking of retrieving results is performed using the default (Language Model (LM) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,505.80,639.68,10.79,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) retrieval model of Indri. The resulted PMCIDs of the good and bad queries per clinical question type are combined (excluding the bad PMCIDs from the good) and using the articles that contain full-text, we build three indices for each clinical question type. These indices consist of the following XML fields: titles, publication categories, abstracts, keywords and bodies (full-text).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Index of Type (b)</head><p>In this type of index, we do not follow any special technique in the building process and for indexing we use all the articles that have body (full-text) using the default settings of Indri v5.5 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,475.63,191.65,9.96,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, except that we enable the Krovetz stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,258.39,203.61,9.96,9.52" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The XML fields that are used in this case is the same with the indices of type (a), i.e. title group, publication categories, abstract, keywords and body (full-text). The purpose of this index is to used as a reference point in our experiments and to detect the di↵erences from the usage of indices in type (a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Query Construction Methods</head><p>In this section, we present the four query construction methods that are applied to the two types of indices (Section 2) in order to provide three runs for each task (A and B) of the TREC 2015 clinical decision support track. For retrieval, we use as a search engine the Indri v5.5 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,433.80,317.74,9.96,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and the ranking of retrieving results is performed using the default (Language Model (LM)) retrieval model. The proposed four query construction methods are:</p><p>(i) Manual query construction from medical experts (ii) Automatic query construction using all summary terms of each topic (iii) Automatic query construction using the semantically expanded summary terms of each topic that are previously mapped to particular medical concepts (iv) Automatic query construction using the method (iii) and additionally the semantically expanded terms of clinical question types and diagnosis field (only in task B)</p><p>In the following we describe in detail the proposed four query construction methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method (i):</head><p>In this query construction method, we recruited a medical expert to provide us with the queries he would issue in PubMed's search engine in order to retrieve relevant articles for each medical case and clinical question. The majority of these queries were practically the diagnoses of topics. The main goal of this method is to understand how medical experts search in PubMed to find helpful literature. This manual query construction method consists our manual run in the task A of the competition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method (ii):</head><p>In this method, we use as query in each topic all the terms in an ORed fashion (#combine( • • • )) of the topic's summary field by removing all punctuation and special characters.</p><p>The produced queries of this method were used to retrieve a baseline set of results. However, the track results showed, as shown in Section 4, that this simple method works better than the other more complicated methods.</p><p>Method (iii): An overview of this method is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,365.49,630.45,4.98,9.52" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and follows an approach somehow similar to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,137.15,642.41,10.51,9.52" target="#b3">[4]</ref> regarding the utilized semantic tools. The main goal of this method is to detect the  medical concepts of the topic's summary and to expand them with terms from semantic control vocabularies. The processes that we followed in order to perform the query construction are:</p><p>• Age group extraction: In this process, we detect keywords or phrases, such as "XX-year-old", "XX yo", "young", and "child", in the summary field of topics, and assign them to particular age groups: 'child' (age  16), 'young adult' (17  age  45), 'middle age adult' (46  age  65) and 'old adult' (age 66).</p><p>• Gender extraction: Accordingly, with this process we detect the subject's gender in the summary of topics. Thus, if we detect the term 'man' or 'male', we will keep in the query the synonyms terms &lt;man male&gt; and so on.</p><p>• Medical concepts extraction: In order to detect automatically the medical concepts in the topics' summary, we utilize the MetaMap [1] application of UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="5,407.57,480.75,10.51,9.52" target="#b2">[3]</ref> through its Java API The results of this process were a list of UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) per matched medical concepts.</p><p>• Synonyms terms expansion of medical concepts: The mapped medical concepts (list of CUIs) from the previous process are used as input in the UMLS Metathesaurus application <ref type="bibr" coords="6,509.69,109.93,10.51,9.52" target="#b2">[3]</ref> through its Java API<ref type="foot" coords="6,212.25,120.65,3.97,6.39" target="#foot_1">5</ref> in order to retrieve synonyms terms. The used parameters in this application were:</p><p>-UMLS release: 2014AB</p><p>-Included language of terms: English (ENG) In all previous processes, the final detected terms, phrases or synonyms are passed through the Krovetz stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="6,170.46,279.83,10.51,9.52" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in order to avoid duplicated terms or phrases in the generated query. Thus, the final generated query consists of age group, gender and only the mapped medical concepts with their synonyms. A query example of this method using the Indri Query Language <ref type="bibr" coords="6,474.87,303.74,10.51,9.52" target="#b7">[8]</ref> has the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,127.92,191.79,5.73,2.51">-</formula><p>#combine(young adult &lt;man male&gt; &lt;#16(coffee ground emesi)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,432.98,335.22,49.40,16.42">• • • &gt; • • • )</formula><p>In this query and in case where there are phrases, we use a maximum ordered window of 16 words instead of the exact phrase so as to relax the search condition of phrase medical concepts. This window of 16 words, as shown in literature <ref type="bibr" coords="6,274.82,378.30,9.95,9.52" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, performs better results and ensuring some relatedness between terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method (iv):</head><p>In comparison with method (iii), this method additionally exploits the topic's diagnosis using semantically expanded terms in order to enrich the retrieval results. Apart from the processes in the method (iii) and as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,342.33,434.63,3.87,9.52" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we employ two additional processes in the query generation:</p><p>• Adding expanded clinical question types: For the three di↵erent types, we include in the query the following synonyms terms based on the UMLS Metathesaurus:</p><p>- The final generated query has the same form with the query in method (iii) including additionally the resulted terms from the previous two processes.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="7,304.78,142.66,181.65,9.52">(a) (b) (i) (ii) (iii)<label>(iv)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Runs and Results</head><p>In this section, we discuss the features as well as the o cial evaluation of the six runs we submitted to the TREC 2015 Clinical Decision Support Track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Submitted Runs</head><p>In the TREC 2015 Clinical Decision Support Track we submitted in total six runs, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,119.88,372.34,3.87,9.52" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, based on two di↵erent index types (Section 2) and di↵erent query construction method (Section 3). In the submitted runs we followed the guidelines given in the web-page of the track <ref type="bibr" coords="7,501.94,384.30,14.61,9.52" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>The evaluation results according to the infAP, infNDCG, R-prec, and P@10 measures over all the topics of our six runs are reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,275.24,442.53,3.87,9.52" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. Additionally, Figures <ref type="figure" coords="7,380.44,442.53,4.98,9.52" target="#fig_6">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="7,406.37,442.53,4.98,9.52" target="#fig_2">4</ref> show as box-and-whisker plots the distribution of infNDCG and P@10 scores, respectively, across all the topics for our runs. Runs plotted with blue shading are manual runs, with white shading are automatic runs that utilize the diagnosis field of topics and with gray shading are automatic runs that are comparable among them. The definitions of these measures are:</p><p>• Inferred Average Precision (infAP): This measure approximates the average precision even when the relevance judgments are incomplete <ref type="bibr" coords="7,318.01,524.22,15.49,9.52" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,336.83,524.22,11.62,9.52" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>• Inferred Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (infNDCG): This measure approximates the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list using the graded relevance scale of the assessors <ref type="bibr" coords="7,253.25,568.06,10.51,9.52" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,267.09,568.06,11.62,9.52" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>• R-Precision (R-prec): R-precision is the precision after R documents have been retrieved, where R is the number of relevant documents for the topic.</p><p>• Precision at Rank 10 (P@10): The fraction of articles within the top-10 results where the doctor judges as relevant documents. According to Table <ref type="table" coords="9,195.52,97.97,3.87,9.52" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, and Figures <ref type="figure" coords="9,263.33,97.97,4.98,9.52" target="#fig_6">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="9,292.23,97.97,3.87,9.52" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, DuthMmMtB16f yielded better results in all topics and tasks (A and B) than the other in 3 of 4 evaluation measures (infAP, infNDCG, and R-prec). However, this run is not to compare with the other five runs because is the only run that utilize the diagnosis field of test and treatment topics. The four runs, DuthMmMt16s, DuthMmMt16f, DuthBaseS and DuthBaseF, are comparable among them as automatic runs and DuthBaseF provided better results in all evaluation measures. From this comparison, we concluded that the simple query construction method (ii) yields better results than the semantic-based method (iii) and also the simple index of type (b) is better than the dedicated indices of type (a) based on study designs of articles. As regards the comparison with the manual run DuthStef, the automatic runs, DuthBaseF and DuthMmMtB16f, provided comparable results with this manual run and some measures (infAP, Rprec and P@10) have better results from this. Another interesting conclusion is that DuthMmMtB16f is little better than DuthMmMt16f for the clinical question of diagnosis and the only di↵erence in the queries was the synonyms set &lt;diagnosis diagnose diagnosing&gt;. Overall, the evaluation results of our participation show that our runs (or some of that) are comparable with the runs of other participants (this year track and 2014 track <ref type="bibr" coords="9,313.69,265.34,10.79,9.52" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) and sometimes simpler solutions are better in result quality. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we described our participation in the TREC 2015 Clinical Decision Support Track.</p><p>In the context of this work, we presented two approaches for the pre-processing and indexing of the open-access PubMed articles, and four methods for the query construction.
