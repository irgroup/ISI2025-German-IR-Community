An overview is presented to introduce our community question answer system and discuss the technologies. This year, the Trec LiveQA track expands the traditional QA track, focusing on "live" question answering for the real-user questions. At this challenge, we built a real-time community question answer system. Our results are presented at the end of the paper.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The automated question answering (QA) track, which has been one of the most popular tracks in TREC for many years, focuses on the task of providing automatic answers for human questions. The track primarily deals with factual questions, and the answers provided by participants are extracted from a corpus of News articles. While the task evolves to model increasingly realistic information needs, addressing question series, list questions, and even interactive feedback, a major limitation remains: the questions do not directly come from real users in real time.</p><p>The LiveQA track revives and expands the QA track, focusing on "live" question answering for real-user questions this year. Real user questions, extracted from the stream of most recent questions submitted on the Yahoo Answers (YA) site that have not yet been answered by humans, will be sent to our systems. Then our system provides an answer in real time.</p><p>This paper introduces our question answering system, which we use for extracting answers for realuser questions in real time. Since many questions submitted on these CQA sites like Yahoo Answers, have been asked by someone else or have been answered somewhere else on the web, we assume that most the real-user question can be solved if we can make full use of the existing question-answer pairs on the Web. In this task, we convert the focus from answering the given question to finding the best answer in the existing problems-answer pairs, where we make use of the existing question-answer pairs as the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview</head><p>Our system contains three parts: the QA search module, the question selection module and the answer selection module. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,247.88,626.48,4.54,8.69" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the architecture.</p><p>In the QA search module, the questions first analyzed, comprising the full and shallow parses and the named entity tagging module. We used these semantic information to expand the original questions to our new queries. We apply these new queries to search all relevant question-answer 3 Approaches</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The QA search module</head><p>After analyzing the Yahoo Answers site, we find out that the search service provided by Yahoo Answers is appropriate for the QA search. By using the Web service, users can search the questions and sort the answers by the relevance, the waiting time or the number of answers. In Table <ref type="table" coords="3,489.84,226.02,3.53,8.69" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we evaluate our experimental results configuring multiple strategies.</p><p>We use the sample of 1000 Yahoo Answers QIDs<ref type="foot" coords="3,327.24,246.71,3.62,5.83" target="#foot_0">1</ref> in the experiment and manually input 100 questions of them as our queries. The results returned for each query are judged on a YES/NO scale. Note that "YES" means that at least one question has the same meaning with the query or contains a suitable answer for our query in the candidate results. We finally choose the relevance strategy for our system to search questions on Yahoo Answers and develop a spider module to generate candidate questions automatically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Question Selection Module</head><p>By studying the candidates generated by the QA search module, we find that Yahoo sorted the questions in terms of the semantic similarity between the query and the candidate question title. However, Yahoo did not use the semantic information from the question description. Then, we add the semantic information in this module to re-calculate the relevance between the query and each candidate question using LSI and LDA <ref type="bibr" coords="3,269.08,443.82,13.41,8.69" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. LSA and LDA is a widely used corpus-based measure when evaluating textual similarity. We adopt the vector space sentence similarity, which represents each sentence as a single distributional vector and sums up the LSA/LDA vector of each word in the sentence. After that, the original rank sorted by Yahoo is integrated with the similarity as candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Answer Selection Module</head><p>In this module, we choose the best answer among the candidate question. First, we treat this task as a supervised classification problem <ref type="bibr" coords="3,263.26,540.57,12.12,8.69" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. First, our training data contain the L6 corpus<ref type="foot" coords="3,471.27,539.45,3.62,5.83" target="#foot_1">2</ref> and 190 thousand question pages from Yahoo Answer in categories specified by the organizers. Then, we calculate the probability of each answers as the best answer, through applying the logistic regression.</p><p>Furthermore, we extract features <ref type="bibr" coords="3,256.26,573.28,11.10,8.69" target="#b3">[4]</ref> from multiple sources of CQA-based information, i.e. bagof-words and answer-specific features from answer, string matching and semantic similarity from QA pair, question specific features from question. Specifically, to measure the semantic similarity between two documents, we employ two WordNet-based word similarity metrics: Unt <ref type="bibr" coords="3,449.82,606.00,12.37,8.69" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and LCH <ref type="bibr" coords="3,496.34,606.00,14.32,8.69" target="#b1">[2]</ref> similarity. We also use the LSI/LDA method mentioned above in question selection module to calculate the text similarity.</p><p>Our system answers all the 1083 questions provided by the LiveQA server, in which 331 questions are returned the default answer as "yes". The specific metrics include: the average answer score, precision (fraction of answered questions with a score above a threshold), and coverage (fraction of all questions answered).</p><p>Overall, 1087 questions have been measured and scored using 4-level scale. The performance measures are:</p><p>• avg-score(0-3) -average score over all queries (transferring 1-4 level scores to 0-3, hence comparing 1-level score with no-answer score, also considering -2-level score as 0)</p><p>• succ@i+ -number of questions with i+ score (i=1..4) divided by number of all questions</p><p>• prec@i+ -number of questions with i+ score (i=2..4) divided by number of answered only questions</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,149.26,293.70,4.54,8.69" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the scores of the answers corresponding to the 1087 questions. We get higher score in all the performance evaluation. Especially, we get thirty percent higher in the succ@4 and prec@4 than the average score, that means our system has good performance in answering the questions that has been asked before.We can find out the most relevant question and its specific answer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented our method and experiments result in solving the LiveQA task. And we get good performances in solving the questions come from the real users, in real time.</p><p>When processing the nature language questions, we intend to understand the deep meaning that the user really want to know. It is hard to use a machine-learning method to achieve that. And we found that it is di cult to answer the real user questions(mostly not the factual questions) using a state of the art QA technology.</p><p>In the future, we are planing to do more research on the LiveQA question. Considering the superiority of IR technology, we intend to combine our system with advanced retrieval system to solve the opinion questions. To dealing with the factual questions, we can refer to the QA task before.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,228.50,550.07,170.25,8.69;2,167.49,244.50,292.28,302.54"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Relevance Prediction Framework</figDesc><graphic coords="2,167.49,244.50,292.28,302.54" type="bitmap" /></figure>
