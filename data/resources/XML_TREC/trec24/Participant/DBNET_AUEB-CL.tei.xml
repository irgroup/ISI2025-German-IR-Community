<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the goals of clinical decision support systems is to provide physicians information about how to best care for their patients. The Clinical Decision Support track organized by TREC, focuses on developing new techniques to retrieve articles from the biomedical literature relevant to the medical records of the patients. Due to the large volume of the existing literature and the diversity in the biomedical field, this is a very challenging task. This paper describes the two medical information retrieval systems designed by the Athens University of Economics and Business for participation in the 2015 Clinical Decision Support track. The two systems share many common features. Both made use of bigrams along with unigrams for repesenting the documents. Both systems performed automatic query expansion using popular medical knowledge bases. However, the two systems employed different strategies to index the corpus which led to different retrieval methods. One utilized the vector space model with tf -idf term weighting, while the other the vector space model with tw -idf term weighting. The results showed that tf -idf outperformed tw -idf .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Clinical decision making is a very complex process that requires high levels of knowledge and skills. In order to make decisions that lead to high-quality and patient-centered care, physicians often need to obtain adequate information from multiple sources. Biomedical literature forms a valuable source of information for making clinical decisions and physicians often need to consult it for the latest information in patient care. However, due to its immense size, searching for the most relevant and timely information for a particular clinical need is not possible in practice.</p><p>Clinical decision support systems are designed to assist physicians with clinical decision making tasks. One of the goals of these systems is to help physicians find information relevant to the medical cases they encounter. As a step towards this direction, the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) initiated in 2014 the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track which simulates the requirements of such systems in an attempt to bring new advances to the field with the development of systems able to provide high-quality information. More specifically, each topic within TREC CDS is a medical case narrative that represents an actual medical record. For each topic, there is available a complete description of the patient's case as well as a simplified version that contains less irrelevant information. In addition, the topics are annotated according to the three most common generic clinical question types: diagnosis, test and treatment. The corpus for both the 2014 and the 2015 task was a snapshot of the Open Access Subset<ref type="foot" coords="2,476.12,201.11,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">4</ref> of PubMed Central<ref type="foot" coords="2,218.42,213.06,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">5</ref> (PMC) consisting of 733, 138 articles in the biomedical domain. For each case report, participants were asked to retrieve the most useful articles for answering a generic clinical question belonging to one of the three types listed above. An example of a case-based topic that was used in the 2015 task is shown in Table  conducted (Tasks A &amp; B). In Task A, the structure of all topics was exactly the one described above. In Task B, an additional field was added to the treatment and test topics providing the patient's diagnosis.</p><p>In this paper, we present the search models and indexing strategies that we employed for retrieving scientific articles relevant to the topics published by the organizing committee of CDS. We chose to incorporate both unigrams and bigrams in our document representation. Hence, besides unigrams, bigrams were also indexed. As regards the weighting of the terms within each document, we employed the well-known tf score and we also introduced a new score, denoted by tw, which corresponds to the importance of the terms within the graph-ofwords document representation. We explored two different retrieval methods: the vector space model with tf -idf similarity and the vector space model with tw -idf similarity. Finally, we utilized popular external biomedical knowledge resources (MetaMap, Wikipedia) for automatic query expansion.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of our proposed approaches. Section 3 presents the evaluation results of these approaches. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the work and presents potential future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we present the various indexing and retrieval strategies that we employed as well as the preprocessing phase that preceded indexing. For both indexing and retrieval, we used Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="3,334.61,230.99,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">6</ref> , a well-known search engine in Information Retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preprocessing Phase</head><p>We obtained the collection of documents from the official site of the task <ref type="foot" coords="3,455.92,290.77,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">7</ref> . We chose to index only the text of the articles and to ignore the supplemental material. The full text of each of the 733, 138 articles is represented as an NXML file (XML encoded using the NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Library). For each article, we extracted its plain text by removing any tags and irrelevant information. The next step was to perform standard text processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword, punctuation and special character removal, and stemming. The stemming was performed using Porter's algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,444.16,376.03,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Indexing Strategy</head><p>After the preprocessing phase was completed, the processed text of all articles was transformed into an inverted index in order to make term-based search more efficient.</p><p>One of the main features of our system is the use of bigrams. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text. In our case, the items correspond to terms. More specifically, we indexed both the terms appearing in the text and the bigrams constructed by these terms. Due to the highly technical terminology of the biomedical literature, pairs of terms may appear often together in the same order. Hence, although the use of bigrams would make the indexing and retrieval phases slower, it could prove beneficial for the retrieval of relevant articles.</p><p>We created two different indexes. The first index used Lucene's default scoring method: a vector space model using tf -idf weighting and cosine similarity. The second index was created by replacing the tf -idf scores of the terms with their tw -idf scores, where tw is a score measuring the importance of each term in the graph-of-words representation of documents described below.</p><p>Besides the traditional vector space model, we also chose to represent each document as a statistical graph-of-words, following earlier approaches in keyword extraction <ref type="bibr" coords="4,182.29,118.99,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,194.47,118.99,7.75,8.74" target="#b5">6]</ref> and more recent ones in ad hoc IR <ref type="bibr" coords="4,361.53,118.99,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,373.71,118.99,7.75,8.74" target="#b8">9]</ref> and in summarization <ref type="bibr" coords="4,134.77,130.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>After the preprocessing and bigram generation phases, each document is transformed into an unweighted, undirected graph whose vertices represent unique terms and whose edges represent co-occurrences of the connected terms within a fixed-size window. Hence, besides the terms (vertices), the graph-of-words representation of text also models the relationships between them (edges). All the words present in a document have some relationships with one another, modulo a window size outside of which the relationship is not taken into consideration, and graphs are able to capture these dependencies.</p><p>We next give in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,256.50,238.55,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  of Socrates's well-known saying: "I know one thing: that I know nothing". For illustration purposes, no bigrams are constructed. In addition, only the colon is removed and no other text processing tasks are performed. Each vertex represents a unique term and each edge a co-occurrence of the two terms in at least one window of size 3, i.e. it captures trigram relationships. Hence, each word (vertex) is connected with an edge with each one of its two preceding and two following words, if any. As regards the documents belonging to the CDS track's corpus, we set the size of the window equal to 6 as the number of terms in the documents is generally large.</p><p>In order to measure the importance of each vertex (word) within the graphof-words, we employed PageRank <ref type="bibr" coords="4,283.38,572.06,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a well-known ranking algorithm. Let G = (V, E) be a simple undirected graph where V is the set of vertices and E the set of edges. We will denote ne(v) the neighbors of vertex v ∈ V , that is, the vertices that are adjacent to v. The number of neighbors of vertex v ∈ V is called the degree of v, and we denote it by deg(v). The score of a vertex v is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,222.37,639.25,253.98,27.27">S(v) = (1 -d) + d v ∈ne(v) 1 deg(v ) S(v ) (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,476.35,645.99,4.24,8.74">)</formula><p>where d is a damping factor that integrates into the model the probability of jumping from a given vertex to another random vertex in the graph. The damping factor d can take values between 0 and 1 and it is usually set to 0.85. For our experiments, we also set d equal to this value. After computing the PageRank scores for all the vertices of the graph, we determine the tw score of each term using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,280.49,200.32,195.86,8.74">tw = S(u) (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,476.34,200.32,4.24,8.74">)</formula><p>where tw is the score of the term corresponding to vertex u in the graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Retrieval Strategy</head><p>At the retrieval stage, the documents are ranked in decreasing order by relevance criteria with respect to a query. Although the descriptions of the medical cases are generally long, we performed query expansion in order to produce more useful queries that are likely to retrieve more relevant documents. Query expansion is the process of adding additional terms to a query in order to improve the retrieval performance. It has proven to be an effective strategy for improving search results in biomedical Information Retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="5,406.21,342.83,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,423.37,342.83,7.01,8.74" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Note that most of the participants in the 2014 CDS task performed query expansion by adding extra terms to the original topics. In the biomedical domain, different terms may correspond to the same concept. A document relevant to a medical case narrative may not be retrieved if it makes exclusive use of a term different from the one used in the narrative to describe the same concept. To deal with this problem, we included a query expansion module in our system. This module expands the queries by adding the synonyms of the clinical terms that appear in them. The module uses MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="5,298.83,438.47,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a popular tool for recognizing clinical concepts in the text.</p><p>In Task B, besides MetaMap, we also performed query expansion using information extracted from Wikipedia 8 , a common source of knowledge for natural language processing tasks. In this task, the organizing committee provided participants with a diagnosis field for the treatment and test topics. Given a patient's diagnosis, the approach that we took was to retrieve the corresponding to the diagnosis Wikipedia article and then to expand the query by appending the summary of the Wikipedia article to it. Note here that for 4 out of the 20 topics containing a diagnosis field, no relevant Wikipedia articles could be retrieved. Hence, query expansion was performed only for the remaining 16 topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we provide results regarding our participation in the 2015 CDS track. As mentioned earlier, in the 2015 task, two rounds of evaluation were conducted (Tasks A &amp; B). The track received a total of 178 runs from 36 different groups. For each topic, the following four evaluation metrics were computed: inferred average precision (infAP), inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG), precision at R (R-prec) and precision at 10 (P@10). More information about these metrics is given in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,296.35,154.86,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Four automatic runs were submitted for evaluation, two in Task A and two in Task B. In Task A, the following two runs were submitted:</p><p>1. tw bi ex: uses a vector space model including both unigrams and bigrams, tw -idf weighting and query expansion using MetaMap. 2. tf bi ex: uses a vector space model including both unigrams and bigrams, tf -idf weighting and query expansion using MetaMap.</p><p>In Task B, the tw bi ex run was exactly the same as in Task A, while in the case of the tf bi ex run, the queries were further expanded using information from Wikipedia. For each run, we calculated the average of each metric over all topics. We also calculated the average of each metric over topics belonging to each clinical question type. The results for the two tasks of the 2015 CDS track are shown in lower corresponds to tf bi ex. From the table, we can observe that tf bi ex had the best overall results for each metric on both tasks, while tw bi ex did not perform as well. Hence, in contrast to other tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="6,358.96,596.34,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in retrieving biomedical articles relevant to medical cases, tw -idf weighting failed to outperform tf -idf weighting. As regards the performance per clinical question type, in Task A, tf bi ex produced better infNDCG, R-prec and P@10 scores than tw bi ex on all topics. However, tw bi ex managed to outperform tf bi ex, in terms of infAP score, on diagnosis and test topics. In Task B, tf bi ex dominated on all topics and for all metrics. In Task A, both tw bi ex and tf bi ex are most effective in retrieving relevant documents for topics belonging to the treatment category and next to the test category. Conversely, in Task B, using the extra information provided by the diagnosis field, tf bi ex managed to retrieve more relevant documents for topics belonging to the test category than for topics belonging to the treatment category.</p><p>To provide a comparative analysis of the performance of our runs with the runs submitted by the other participants, we present the same information for the average of the maximum and the average of the median scores. More specifically, Table <ref type="table" coords="7,214.06,226.59,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">3</ref> illustrates the average of the maximum and the average of the median scores of each metric over all topics and over topics belonging to each clinical question type for both tasks of the 2015 CDS track. The upper table corresponds to maximum, while the lower corresponds to median. On average, the scores produced by our runs were close to the median scores, while they were way below the maximum scores. In Task A, tw bi ex performed below the median for all metrics except for P@10, while tf bi ex performed above the median for all metrics. In TaskB, tw bi ex performed below the median for all metrics. However, this is not a fair comparison. As mentioned earlier, tw bi ex does not exploit the information provided by the diagnosis field. On the other hand, tf bi ex again managed to performed above the median for all metrics.</p><p>We next investigate how challenging was the retrieval of relevant articles for each one of the 30 topics. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,288.70,620.25,4.98,8.74">2</ref> illustrates the P@10 scores of tw bi ex, tf bi ex, maximum and median for all 30 topics of Task A. For some topics, the retrieval of relevant articles was a really challenging task. For example, for topics 18, 20, 25, 27 and 28, more than half of the participant systems could not Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,231.65,371.99,4.13,7.89">2</ref>. P@10 scores for all 30 topics of Task A.</p><p>find one single relevant document in the top 10. For other topics, such as topics 16, 22 and 30, the results were high in general. The median P@10 scores for all these three topics were 0.9000. The same scores for all 30 topics of Task B are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,209.95,442.14,3.87,8.74">3</ref>. The additional information provided by the diagnosis field increased the general performance of the participant systems. More specifically, in Task B, only for two topics (2 and 25), more than half of the participant systems could not find one single relevant document in the top 10. Hence, the number of such topics decreased from 5 in Task A to 2 in Task B. In addition, the number of topics for which the participant systems managed to retrieve several relevant documents in the top 10 increased significantly compared to Task A. For example, the median P@10 scores for topics 16, 22, 26, 29 and 30 were 1.0000, 1.0000, 0.9000, 0.9000 and 0.9000 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>Improving the performance of systems that retrieve documents relevant to medical case descriptions is an important challenge for Information Retrieval. TREC contributed to this end by organizing the CDS track for second year in a row. In this paper, we presented the different systems that we built for participating in the 2015 CDS track. Our participation focused on the evaluation of various language models, document representations, term weighting models and query Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,233.12,371.99,4.13,7.89">3</ref>. P@10 scores for all 30 topics of Task B expansion models. The system that weighted the terms using the popular tf term weighting scheme exhibited better performance than the system that the terms based on their importance within the graph-of-words representation of documents. In general, our proposed methods yielded relatively good results and can serve as a good starting point for future participation in the track. In terms of future directions of research, we would like to investigate how to more properly utilize external biomedical knowledge resources.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,134.77,398.72,345.82,7.89;4,134.77,409.71,345.83,7.86;4,134.77,420.67,53.00,7.86"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
