<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The text mining group at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva has a long history of participation in TREC campaigns, including TREC Genomics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.29,409.84,11.79,9.86" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, TREC Medical Records <ref type="bibr" coords="1,137.54,422.80,11.79,9.86" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, TREC Chemical IR <ref type="bibr" coords="1,245.57,422.80,11.79,9.86" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and last year's TREC Clinical Decision Support track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,263.99,435.76,12.01,9.86" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The group thus already works on medical Information Extraction from scientific publications, but also from social media. For example, 60,000 tweets are published daily about pharmaceutical drug specifications. As in 2014, the focus of the Clinical Decision Support Track was the retrieval of biomedical articles relevant for answering generic clinical questions about medical records.</p><p>Last year, we investigated a lot of strategies, such as sections indexing, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) enrichment, or article-type boosting. This year we focused on re-ranking based on citations network. Basically, an article has two types of citations: incoming and outgoing citations. For example, if an article A contains a reference to an article B in its Reference section, we will say that article A has an outgoing citation to article B, and article B has an incoming citation from article A. Thus, both types of citations can be used in order to improve Information Retrieval. Such attempts are reported in the literature, from Salton in 1971 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,482.38,336.74,12.91,9.86" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to the complete thesis of Larsen <ref type="bibr" coords="1,388.25,349.70,11.77,9.86" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>For this campaign, we first started from the last year's best settings in order to establish a baseline. Then, we tried to improve this baseline with reranking strategies based on incoming, then outgoing citations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and strategies</head><p>All retrievals were generated with Terrier <ref type="bibr" coords="1,518.96,467.68,11.80,9.86" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, an IR platform (in Java) which implements state-of-the-art indexing and retrieval functionalities, including a TREC format output. In the following, the Retrieval Status Value (RSV) is the relevance score attributed to a document by Terrier. Post-processing strategies were applied thanks to local scripts in Perl.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Baseline</head><p>We used a linear combinations of two indexes with the Okapi BM25 and PL2 weighting schemes, with default settings, and an automatic relevance feedback query expansion: see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,388.18,628.27,12.91,9.86" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for more details about Terrier models.</p><p>In queries, all numbers were automatically discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Exploiting incoming citations</head><p>For a document d, the number of incoming citations is the number of documents that contain a citation to this document d. Of course, this number grows with time. Moreover, it would be extremely difficult to locate all documents in the world, and to efficiently extract their references in order to precisely compute this number. Thus, we only worked with PubMed Central (PMC), in which references are well-structured. Even if we miss all non-PMC incoming citations, we assume that papers most cited in PMC are papers most cited in general. Then, reranking based on such popularity is feasible. PMC was accessed on July 2015.</p><p>For the TREC CDS documents, the average number of incoming citations from PMC was 3.2. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,242.72,210.45,5.52,9.66">1</ref> shows the decile analysis of this number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decile Number of incoming citations</head><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,100.58,267.05,93.72,154.67">0% 0 10% 0 20% 0 30% 0 40% 0 50% 1 60% 2 70% 2 80% 4 90% 7 100% 2031</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,59.04,432.71,3.77,8.72">1</ref>. Decile analysis of the number of incoming citations for the articles in the collection. Incoming citations were collected only from PubMed Central.</p><p>We thus used this number of citations (nbcit) in order to boost the score of the articles that are the most cited, thanks to Formula 1. Alpha is a setting parameter. This boosting is a strict reranking according to the number of incoming citations: no new document is added in the results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Exploiting outgoing citations</head><p>For exploiting outgoing citations, the idea was to promote the references of the retrieved documents. This strategy achieved leading results with patents (see TREC Chem campaigns <ref type="bibr" coords="2,148.70,691.94,11.79,9.66" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with up to +150% for MAP), but it was the first time we applied this to the medical literature. Formula 2 gives the final score of a document d after re-ranking. E is the set of retrieved documents (1000 by default), is_citedd,e is 1 if document d is cited in document e, 0 otherwise. Beta is a setting parameter. This boosting is more than a strict reranking: new documents can appear, which were not retrieved by the search engine but cited by the retrieved articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>In the following, we describe results in light of Top Precision, which is the Precision at interpolated Recall 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Boosting with incoming citations</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,351.39,307.29,5.52,9.66" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows results with different values of alpha, from 0.1 to 10. All results were computed after the competition. We observe a small optimum (TopP 0.66 with alpha between 4 and 5). Compared to the baseline (topP 0.645), the improvement is modest (+2.5%). Yet, the baseline R-Prec was never improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Boosting with outgoing citations</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,349.59,628.70,5.52,9.66" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows results with different values of beta, from 0.1 to 2. All results were computed after the competition. The best setting (beta 0.2) leads to a small decrease compared to the baseline (-10%).</p></div>
