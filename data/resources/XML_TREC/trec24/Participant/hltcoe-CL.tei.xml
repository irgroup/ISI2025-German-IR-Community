<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>For this year's Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track we again used the JHU HAIRCUT retrieval engine described by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,154.95,495.37,139.30,10.45" target="#b2">McNamee and Mayfield (2004)</ref>. One of HAIRCUT's distinctive traits is the use of character n-grams as indexing terms, which have proven to be effective for controlling the effects of morphological variation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,184.39,549.57,109.72,10.45" target="#b3">(McNamee et al., 2009)</ref>. While morphological variation is not nearly as substantial a problem in English as it is in some other languages, it seems likely that the highly technical terminology prevalent in medical literature could benefit from stemming or n-gram indexing.</p><p>Our submissions were produced in less than a person-day of effort. As the document collection remained unchanged from 2014, we used previously created indexes. We had hoped to explore other techniques, including relevance feedback using "collection enrichment" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,194.65,699.07,104.15,10.45" target="#b1">(Kwok and Chan, 1998)</ref> from appropriate medical domain side corpora, how-   We did not make any use of domain-specific resources such as ontologies, thesauri, or biomedical IE tools. We sought through our participation to determine the performance that a domain-agnostic, state-of-the-art retrieval engine might obtain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Submissions</head><p>We submitted three runs for Task A. Our Task A submissions used the summary field and did not use the description field; this choice was made based on positive results from the 2014 CDS evaluation, although other participants reported better outcomes using the description field <ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.73,590.63,97.58,10.45" target="#b5">(Roberts et al., 2015)</ref>. Each run used pseudo relevance feedback. The three runs varied based on the type of tokenization as can be observed in Table <ref type="table" coords="1,406.08,631.28,5.45,10.45" target="#tab_1">1</ref> above.</p><p>For Task B, our submitted runs were just as in Task A, except that if a diagnosis field was present, then that text was also used in addition to the summary field (see Table <ref type="table" coords="1,407.45,685.49,3.94,10.45" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</p><p>For each task, the principal distinction in our submitted runs is the type of tokenization em-ployed, either unstemmed words or overlapping word-spanning character n-grams of length 4 or 5. When pseudo relevance feedback was applied, terms were weighted based on comparing term frequencies in documents from the top 20 ranks and bottom 75 (of 1000) ranked documents. When unstemmed words were used, queries were expanded (or limited) to 60 words; when n-grams were used, the number of terms in the revised query was 200, whether 4grams or 5-grams. These settings were based on values that have yielded favorable results in previous evaluations.</p><p>A unigram statistical language model for retrieval was employed <ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.92,252.89,74.37,10.45" target="#b0">(Hiemstra, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.55,252.89,83.25,10.45" target="#b4">Miller et al., 1999)</ref> and smoothing was accomplished using linear interpolation: <ref type="formula" coords="2,212.15,309.41,4.85,9.99">1</ref>)P (t|C) (1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,84.58,298.83,127.57,33.10">P (D|Q) / Y t2Q P (t|D) + (</formula><p>Relative document term frequency was used to estimate P (t|D), and P (t|C) was based on the mean relative document term frequency from documents in the collection. The two probabilities were evenly weighted (i.e., a constant of = 0.5 was used) in all conditions. In this model we have generally found retrieval performance to be fairly insensitive to changes in this smoothing parameter, though others have reported differently <ref type="bibr" coords="2,214.95,456.52,83.85,10.45;2,72.00,470.07,23.48,10.45">(Zhai and Lafferty, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>NIST provided results for each of our official runs, and we report average results over the 30 topics in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,99.59,548.85,4.09,10.45" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Sampled metrics include inferred average precision (infAP), inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG), precision at the number of known relevant documents (R-prec), and precision at a fixed cutoff of 10 documents (P@10).</p><p>At the time of submission we created runs that used the description instead of summary, and runs which did not use relevance feedback, though it should be noted that these runs did not contribute to the judgment pools. If the pools created for judging relevance are not biased against post-hoc runs, then we can make direct comparisons using these "post hoc" runs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We make several observations from these results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Summary vs. Description</head><p>We confirm our finding form 2014 that use of summaries results in better performance than use of the description field; performance in all metrics was notably higher using the summary topics. As can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,378.22,372.86,4.09,10.45">4</ref>, MAP, P@10, and the number of retrieved relevant documents are better in each run when the summary field is used instead of the description field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Relevance Feedback</head><p>While there is no guarantee that performance may not be negatively affected on a particular query, relevance feedback boosts average performance. Table 4 reveals marked improvement on both recallsensitive and precision-focused metrics. The Task B run using 5-grams and relevance feedback (i.e., hlt-coe5sdrf) obtains a relative gain of 26.5% in MAP and finds 13.2% more documents compared to its equivalent run that does not use feedback. Similarly, when words are used as indexing terms, hltcoewsdrf sees a relative gain of 41.4% in MAP and finds 22.2% more documents compared to its nonfeedback equivalent.</p><p>While the overall score is slightly lower with words, the relative gain from employing relevance feedback is larger than with n-grams, which we attribute to the fact that feedback conveys benefits in morphological normalization which occur naturally with n-gram representations. For example, "epilepsy" and "epileptic" are entirely separate in-Table <ref type="table" coords="3,98.72,256.76,4.24,10.45">4</ref>: Mean average precision, P@10, and retrieved relevant for various experimental conditions according to trec eval.</p><p>dexing terms, but they share 5-grams such as "epile" and "pilep'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Tokenization</head><p>There appear to be gains using character 5-grams over unstemmed words, particularly if feedback is not applied. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,156.48,397.73,5.45,10.45" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows improvements in infAP and Table <ref type="table" coords="3,116.31,411.28,5.45,10.45">4</ref> shows marginally higher performance in MAP, P@10, and Recall with 5-grams.<ref type="foot" coords="3,242.04,422.86,3.99,7.64" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Diagnosis</head><p>Large gains in retrieval performance were observed when the diagnosis field is used (i.e., Task B vs. the equivalent Task A) run. This effect is on par with the substantial gain achieved with relevance feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Our results in 2015 confirm our observations from the inaugural running of the track in 2014. Our key findings are that relevance feedback or the provision of a diagnosis field conveys a dramatic improvement in performance. We also believe that summaries are superior to the description field, and character ngrams possess advantages over unstemmed words.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="1,329.08,294.14,195.03,59.69"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Runs submitted to Task A</figDesc><table coords="1,329.08,321.00,195.03,32.82"><row><cell>Run</cell><cell>Topic Fields</cell><cell>Terms</cell><cell>RF</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">hltcoewsdrf Summary, Diagnosis</cell><cell>words</cell><cell>Yes</cell></row><row><cell>hltcoe4sdrf</cell><cell cols="3">Summary, Diagnosis 4-grams Yes</cell></row><row><cell>hltcoe5sdrf</cell><cell cols="3">Summary, Diagnosis 5-grams Yes</cell></row></table></figure>
