<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we present our participation to the 2015 TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Track. The goal of this track is to find relevant medical literature for a given medical case report which should help address a specific clinical aspect of the case (known as the Clinical Question Type). We investigated the relative merit of conceptversus word-based representations of the information contained in the case reports, and experimented with different approaches to model Clinical Question Types. We submitted six runs in total, three for subtask A (CDS search without information on the patient's diagnosis) and subtask B (CDS search with information on the patient's diagnosis for topics from the Test and Treatment Clinical Question Types). In both subtasks our best runs were MeSH-based, and they achieved a P@10 and infNDCG of 0.37 and 0.25, and 0.47 and 0.35, for subtask A and B respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Similar to the 2014 track, the goal of the 2015 Clinical Decision Support Track was to retrieve relevant scientific articles in the PubMed Open Access Central set 1 for a given medical case report. A medical case report is a short and well-formed description of a patient's medical record which summarizes the pertinent information for that case. In the CDS track, case reports are provided in two levels of detail: Case summaries are short descriptions that contain one or two sentences at most, for example, Summary: 26-year-old obese woman with bipolar disorder, on zolpidem and lithium, with recent difficulty sleeping, agitation, suicidal ideation, and irritability. Case descriptions, on the other hand, are more detailed and are written in less terse, more natural style. They contain additional contextual information on the patient's condition and history, for example, A 26-year-old obese woman with a history of bipolar disorder complains that her recent struggles with her weight and eating have caused her to feel depressed. She states that she has recently had difficulty sleeping and feels excessively anxious and agitated. She also states that she has had thoughts of suicide. She often finds herself fidgety and unable to sit still for extended periods of time. Her family tells her that she is increasingly irritable. Her current medications include lithium carbonate and zolpidem.</p><p>All 30 topics in the track were manually created by medical experts, who took care to ensure that the most pertinent information is present in both versions of the case reports <ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.95,249.40,9.96,10.23" target="#b14">[9]</ref>. Participants were only allowed to use one of the two representations for a submitted run <ref type="foot" coords="2,421.68,258.94,3.97,8.07" target="#foot_0">2</ref> .</p><p>The CDS track is especially interesting because of the complexity of the search problem. Not only do the issues of ambiguity and scope inherent in natural language severely complicate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the case reports, but the definition of 'relevancy' in this task differs from the traditional notion of 'aboutness': A document is judged relevant only if it is both topically relevant and helps answer a clinical question for the given case, such as "What is the (correct) medical diagnosis for this case?" or "Which treatment should be prescribed to this patient?". This additional dimension of relevance is called Clinical Question Type (CQT). In the CDS track 3 different CQTs are defined: Diagnosis ("What is the (correct) medical diagnosis for this case?"), Test ("Which is the most efficient (diagnostic) test to be used in this case?"), Treatment ("Which treatment should be prescribed to this patient?"). The question of how to (best) represent the CQTs and the interaction between topicality and CQT have been topics of great interest since last year's CDS but are still open areas of research.</p><p>The set-up of this year's instalment was very similar to that of the 2014 CDS track: A total of 30 manually created topics were released by the organizers, which comes to 10 topics per CQT, and retrieval experiments were carried out on the 21/1/2014 snapshot of PubMed's Open Access subset <ref type="foot" coords="2,119.03,450.22,3.97,8.07" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . A novel addition to the track was the introduction of a second subtask: After a the initial retrieval based solely on the text in the case reports (subtask A) was finished, information on the correct diagnoses of topics 11 to 30 were released which could be used in second retrieval task (subtask B).</p><p>In our contribution to this year's track we focused on three points of interest: (a) Similar to last year, we explored the relative usefulness of using MeSH representations compared to word-based representations; (b) We experimented with multiple models of the Clinical Dimension Type in the retrieval process; and (c) We investigated to what extent the information in the case reports is complementary when the correct diagnosis is known.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the individual components of the different systems that were built in the course of this track. In Section 3 we describe the six submitted runs . Results are presented in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Extending MeSH coverage in the corpus</head><p>During our participation last year we found that using MeSH concepts to represent the content of a document leads to the most precise retrieval results but we were severely hindered by the low coverage <ref type="foot" coords="3,128.63,161.66,3.97,8.07" target="#foot_2">4</ref> of MeSH terms in the Open Access set <ref type="bibr" coords="3,302.27,164.08,10.93,10.23">[2]</ref>. This year we opted to resolve this problem by extending the MeSH coverage of the articles ourselves: We used the MTI indexer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,451.35,176.03,12.71,10.23" target="#b10">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,467.99,176.03,7.01,10.23">4]</ref>, available at the NIH 5 , to assign MeSH Main Heading and Subheading labels to the unlabelled documents in the OA set (300K documents). We obtained MeSH label suggestions for 201,213 documents, which boosted coverage to 87% of the corpus. We have, however, no information on the quality of the assigned labels 6 . Analysis of the documents that were not assigned any MeSH labels by the MTI indexer shows that these are mostly short documents, such as 'letters to the editor' from PubMed Central which are unlikely to be of importance in medical search.</p><p>Since the high-precision nature of concepts has proven problematic for search <ref type="bibr" coords="3,457.19,259.72,10.51,10.23" target="#b13">[8]</ref> we decided to increase recall by mimicking the MeSH term explosion <ref type="bibr" coords="3,357.48,271.68,10.52,10.23">[1]</ref> that is implemented in PubMed. During indexation phase we automatically extended the set of MeSH terms associated with a document to include all ancestors of the initial MeSH terms. We kept track of the hierarchical arrangement of the terms by assigning logarithmically decreasing weights to concepts that appear higher up in the hierarchy. We combined several weighting schemes in the index: For example, MeSH terms (and their ancestral trail) of major topics were indexed with the double the weight of non-major headings. To limit the number of MeSH features, the antecedent trail of Main Heading and Subheading combinations were indexed separately. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,379.35,355.36,4.98,10.23" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates the term explosion procedure for a document with three assigned MeSH terms.</p><p>This indexing strategy favours the more specific terms but allows for a back-off to more generic terms if not direct match can be found between query and document. For example, a document that has been assigned a highly specific MeSH term, e.g. "Umbilical Arteries" (D004373), can still be found by a more general query, e.g. " Umbilical Cord" (D014470), because parts of their ancestral chains of MeSH terms coincide. The more generic MeSH terms have a small impact on the final retrieval score due to their high document frequencies and the low weights with which they are indexed. The index of MeSH terms was used in runs 2 and 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Disease hypotheses generation</head><p>In subtask B (runs 4-6) participants were provided with the correct diagnoses for topics 11 up to 30 (CQT T est and Treatment) but for the first ten topics (of the Diagnosis CQT) this information was not available. In order to be able to run the same system pipelines over all 30 topics we therefore generated disease hypotheses for the first ten topics based on the text in the case reports. We opted to use the same strategy as last year <ref type="bibr" coords="3,245.80,545.10,11.84,10.23">[2]</ref>, but with different resources. Last year's disease hypotheses retrieval system covered a small set of very common diseases (taken from the Disease-Symptom Knowledge Database 7 ) and a large set of extremely rare (genetic) disease <ref type="bibr" coords="3,411.25,569.01,16.09,10.23" target="#b15">[10]</ref>. This year we opted for a more balanced coverage and we therefore selected Wikipedia and MedlinePlus as sources for disease hypothesis generation. We extracted a corpus of 2496 articles from Wikipedia, and another corpus of 1796 web pages from MedlinePlus<ref type="foot" coords="4,275.98,413.38,3.97,8.07" target="#foot_4">8</ref> of common to moderately rare diseases. Each document describes exactly one disease or condition, and the two corpora overlapped, i.e. all diseases in the MedlinePlus corpus has a corresponding page in the Wikipedia corpus. These two corpora were chosen with an eye on their coverage and language use: The webpages in MedlinePlus are written in a very accessible style and contain a lot of descriptions of signs and symptoms. Wikipedia articles are more varied in style and are more likely to contain medical terms. The corpus was indexed using Solr<ref type="foot" coords="4,134.39,485.11,3.97,8.07" target="#foot_5">9</ref> . To generate a disease hypothesis for a given topic, we used the text that topics to query the index. The title of the web page with the highest retrieval score was extracted and processed with MetaMap to output the CUI of the most likely disease. Since the diagnoses for topics 1-10 are not known, we cannot evaluate the impact of this step on retrieval performance. However, an evaluation on the diagnoses of topics 11-30 show a moderate performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Reranking</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Time-based reranking</head><p>The aim of a CDS search is to provide a user with relevant articles that enable him or her to make a well-informed decision for a given medical case. If the system returns outdated information, this may negatively impact the decision making process. In the survey on last year's track <ref type="bibr" coords="5,499.14,97.97,10.52,10.23" target="#b12">[7]</ref> it was noted that the assessors who judged the systems output immediately rejected literature that they deemed too old. We therefore decided to incorporate a time-based reranking step in our runs in which the more recent documents were boosted and older documents were demoted. The implementation of this re-ranking step was fairly basic: For each document in the OA set, we extracted the publication data and took the difference of the year of publication with the number 2014 to indicate the rank of the documents. Because of this low granularity, many documents have the same rank. We then combined the time-based rankings with either the retrieval score rankings or both the retrieval score and CQT-based rankings (see below), using the weighted Borda Fuse algorithm <ref type="foot" coords="5,133.88,203.15,7.94,8.07" target="#foot_6">10</ref> . Borda Fuse is a simple rank aggregation algorithm in which ranks are counted as the number of votes in an election. Time-based re-ranking was used in all submitted runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Reranking based on CQT</head><p>As mentioned in Section 1, CQT is a difficult concept to model in retrieval. One of our strategies (next to UMLS-based feature selection (runs 3 and 6) and MeSH-based query expansion (run5)) was an additional re-ranking step in which retrieved documents were re-ranked according to pretrained CQT classification models. These were created as follows: Using a set of manually crafted (boolean) MeSH queries 11 (see Table <ref type="table" coords="5,264.04,309.62,3.87,10.23" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we selected four different subsets of documents from the MeSH-annotated part of the OA snapshot. These four subsets correspond to the three CQTs (Diagnosis,Test and Treatment) and a selection of negative training material (Other ). The 'diagnosis' and 'treatment' MeSH queries were meta-terms (pre-made MeSH queries) that were manually constructed for the CiSMeF project <ref type="bibr" coords="5,248.25,357.44,12.00,10.23" target="#b11">[6]</ref>; The 'test' query was manually constructed by a medical specialist who was involved in the CiSMeF project. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,344.90,369.40,4.98,10.23" target="#tab_0">1</ref> also shows the sizes of the four subsets that were selected.</p><p>We can see that the 'test' query is too specific and retrieved fairly few documents. In order to build well-balanced models, a random subset of max. 12,210 documents was selected from all subsets. This led to a classification subcorpus of 31,735 documents in total.</p><p>The documents for all four categories were indexed as uni-, bi-and trigrams, so as to catch those terms and phrases that are descriptive for and frequently used in the related clinical question type domain. The full text of the document (i.e. Title, Abstract and Body of the articles, as well as information on publication-type) was used. We then used the Winnow algorithm in the Linguistic Classification System (LCS) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,210.68,477.00,13.96,10.23">[3]</ref> to construct classification models for each category in an one-vs-all training. This algorithm has been used successfully for patent and literature classification. One of its main advantage is that the resulting models are human-readable and easy to transform into features for other implementations.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,133.78,524.82,4.98,10.23" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the highest-ranking terms, i.e. terms that have been found to be most distinctive for that particular category compared to the rest of the corpus, for the three different clinical question types.</p><p>In the reranking step, we scored the retrieved documents that were retrieved for a topic with the model of the CQT that was associated with that model. The documents were then reranked according to their classification score with the highest scores, i.e. most relevant features, at the highest ranks. We then combined the CQT ranking with the retrieval score ranking using the weighted Borda Fuse algorithm. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,235.22,608.50,22.13,10.23">CQT</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Retrieval</head><p>All reported retrieval experiments were carried out using Solr. We applied key-word stemming and stopword removal, and indexed the following fields:</p><p>• title: Text extracted from article-title tag • MeSHterms: MeSH concept identifiers extracted from PubMed using the pmc identifier, or assigned to the document by the MTI indexer (see Section 2.1)</p><p>Pseudo-Relevance Feedback was carried out using Solr's "More Like This" (MLT) algorithm.</p></div>

We observe (similar to our findings last year) that the best runs for both subtask A and B are those which utilize MeSH terms to capture relevant information (run2 and run5, respectively The difference between run1 and run4 shows that, unsurprisingly, adding the (correct) diagnosis information increases retrieval scores substantially. This raises the question to what extent the information in the case report is useful if a diagnosis is known. To examine this, we performed an additional run (run5bisMPFMSH) which combines the strategies from run2 and run5. In this run the MTI indexer is used to provide MeSH label suggestions for both the text in the case description, as well as for the diagnosis that is provided for a topic. In the initial retrieval step, the case report MeSH terms and diagnosis MeSH terms are combined with the CQT MeSH query according to the protocol described above for run5. We find that adding information from the case report (in the form of MeSH terms) improves recall but lowers precision at the top of the rankings. Likely the MeSH terms extracted from the case reports lead to query drift.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,102.89,635.84,3.65,6.93;1,107.04,643.66,207.42,2.88"><head>1</head><label></label><figDesc>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/</figDesc></figure>
