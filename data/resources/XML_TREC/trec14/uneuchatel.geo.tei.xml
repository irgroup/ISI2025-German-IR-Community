<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>During our participation in the ad hoc Genomic track, we were concerned with domain-specific IR systems that would provide a ranked list of MEDLINE records in response to requests by biologists. This involved a set of available queries describing typical search interests, and in which gene and protein names were essential elements in effective retrieval.</p><p>Given that in biomedical publications information is evolving rapidly and involves a wide variety of terminology. It is known that large numbers of names, symbols and synonyms are used to denote the same protein or gene. In order to provide a partial solution to some of these problems, this paper describes three strategies that have been suggested to hopefully enhance the effectiveness of biomedical information searches.</p><p>First we evaluate the impact of various stemming procedures used to conflate word variants into an appropriate lemma or stem. This is based on the assumption in IR systems that efficient approaches make use of stemming schemes in order to resolve partially the vocabulary mismatches that occur when users submit terms that are very different from those used by document authors. In other words, when a query contains the term "computer," it would seem reasonable to also retrieve documents containing related words such as "computers," or even "computing." Second, we accept the fact that manually assigned descriptors would increase the chances of retrieving more pertinent documents, especially compared to searches based only on only terms provided in the query. Usually based on controlled vocabularies, manual indexing tends to result in greater indexing consistency. In fact, the underlying thesaurus used would prescribe a uniform and invariable choice of indexing descriptors, normalize orthographic (e.g., "database" or "data base") and lexical variants (e.g., "analyzing," "analysis") or any expressions with similar meanings (e.g., "computer science," "informatics").</p><p>Third, we should also assume that when searching information, users will not know all synonyms and related terms needed to accurately express their information needs. Query expansion would thus take different termterm relationships into account and determine which words or phrases should be included in an expanded query. Based on various empirical studies already carried out, such automatic query expansion approaches usually result in better retrieval performance.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 depicts the main characteristics of our test-collection. Section 3 briefly describes the IR models used during our experiments. Section 4 presents our domain-specific and general query expansion approaches. Section 5 evaluates five different stemming schemes and two query expansion methods. The main findings of this paper are presented in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TEST-COLLECTION</head><p>The corpus used in our experiments was extracted from the well-known MEDLINE 1 bibliographic database on biomedical literature. This corpus subset was made available for the TREC-2005 evaluation campaign and includes around 10 years of scientific publications (4,591,008 records or about 10.6 GB of compressed data). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Example of a MEDLINE record</head><p>Each record is structured according to a specific set of fields 2 , such as PMID (PubMed unique identifier), DP (publication date), AU (author), PT (publication type), SO (source), etc. From an IR perspective, the most important sources of information are the article title (TI), the abstract (AB together with the OAB field, other abstracts supplied by an NLM collaborating organization) and the set of manually assigned MeSH headings (MH) extracted from the MeSH 3 Thesaurus. Along with these three main 1 See http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html 2 For more information about all these fields, see the site http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=helppubmed.t able.pubmedhelp.T44 3 See the site http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html fields, we also might have assumed that the RN field <ref type="foot" coords="2,516.30,107.17,2.92,5.09" target="#foot_0">4</ref> , OT (other non-MeSH keywords) would be of some value in an IR application.</p><p>Within this collection are fifty topics (see examples listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,344.83,157.89,4.05,8.50" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) that correspond to the real information needs expressed by biologists. This topic set is subdivided into five different main scenarios (or typical search interests). Regardless of the topic, the IR system is to return the same type of answer, namely a ranked list of MEDLINE records.</p><p>Five information need scenarios are described below. Topics #100 to #109 correspond to search examples for certain standard methods or protocols, for some given type of experiment (e.g., "How to "open up" a cell"). Topics #110 to #119 represent information describing the role(s) of a gene involved in a disease (e.g., "Interferonbeta and multiple sclerosis"). Topics #120 to #129 represent information needs related to the role of a gene in a specific biological process (e.g., "casein kinase II in ribosome assembly"). Topics #130 to #139 represent information needs describing interactions between two or more genes in the function of an organ or in a disease (e.g., "Bop and Pes in cell growth"). Finally, topics #140 to #149 represent information explaining one or more mutations of a given gene and its biological impact or role (e.g., "mutations in metazoan Pes and effect on cell growth").  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">IR MODELS</head><p>In order to obtain a broader view of the relative merits of the various retrieval models, we analyzed nine different vector-space schemes and two probabilistic models. First we adopted a binary indexing scheme in which each document (or request) was represented by a set of keywords, without any weights. To measure similarities between documents and requests we computed the inner product (retrieval model denoted "doc=bnn, query=bnn" or "bnn-bnn"). Then, to weight the presence of each indexing term in a document surrogate (or in a query), we took term occurrence frequencies into account (denoted tf ij for indexing term t j in document D i , denoting the corresponding retrieval model as "doc=nnn, query=nnn"). We could also account for their inverse document frequency (denoted idf j ) and then also normalize each indexing weight by applying different weighting schemes, as described in the Appendix.</p><p>Other variants could also be created, especially when the occurrence of a particular term in a document is viewed as a rare event. Thus, it may be preferable to assign more importance to the first occurrence of this word, compared to any successive and repetitive occurrences. Therefore, the tf component may be computed as the ln(tf) + 1.0 (retrieval model notation: "doc=ltc, query=ltc") or as 0.5 + 0.5 • [tf / max tf in a document]. Different weighting formulae could of course be used for documents and requests, leading to other different weighting combinations. We might also consider that a term's presence in a shorter document provides stronger evidence than in a longer one, thus leading to more complex IR models; for example the IR model denoted by "doc=Lnu" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.45,600.69,10.33,8.50" target="#b1">[1]</ref>, "doc=dtu" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,163.89,600.69,10.33,8.50" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to these vector-space schemes, we also considered probabilistic models, such as the Okapi model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,57.96,644.55,10.33,8.50" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. As a second probabilistic approach, we implemented the I(n)L2 approach, within the Deviation from Randomness (DFR) framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.39,667.29,10.38,8.50" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. This IR model is based on combining two information measures, formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,68.34,702.25,218.40,11.32">w ij = Inf 1 ij • Inf 2 ij = -log 2 [Prob 1 ij ] • (1-Prob 2 ij )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>in which Prob 1 ij is the probability of having by pure chance tf ij occurrences of the term t j in a document. On the other hand, Prob 2 ij is the probability of encountering a new occurrence of term t j in the document, given that we already found tf ij occurrences of this term.</p><p>Within this DFR framework, the model I(n)L2 is based on the two following formulae:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,320.10,192.85,217.89,35.91">Inf 1 ij = tfn ij • log 2 [(n ) / (df j +0.5)] (2) Prob 2 ij = tfn ij / (tfn ij + 1) (3) with tfn ij = tf ij • log 2 [1 + ((c•mean dl) / l i )]</formula><p>where df j indicates the number of documents indexed with the term t j , n the number of documents in the corpus, tc j the number of occurrences of term t j in the collection, l i the length (number of indexing terms) of document D i , mean dl the average document length, and c a constant. In our experiments, the constant c = 1.5 and mean dl = 146.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">QUERY EXPANSION METHODS</head><p>In this study, we were interested in knowing whether a domain-specific query expansion could provide a better retrieval performance than a general scheme. It is our opinion that in the biomedical domain vocabulary mismatches between requests and documents generated by the terminology variation are a real problem. We thus hope to reduce these mismatches by applying appropriate domain-specific query expansion approaches, as described in Section 4.1. On the other hand, a general query expansion scheme as described in Section 4.2 could also complement our domain-specific approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Domain-Specific Query Expansion</head><p>In the biomedical domain, gene or protein name orthographic variants are numerous. Usually, a few rules <ref type="bibr" coords="3,309.12,523.77,11.40,8.50" target="#b5">[5]</ref> can be used to generate or to allow a match between some of the name variations. These rules are the following:</p><p>-presence of a space or a hyphen ("IL 10," and "IL-10"); -space or hyphen removed ("ddvit1," and "ddvit 1"); -the word alpha or beta might be replaced by a single letter ("epm2-beta" or "epm2b"); -the final digit '-1,' '-2,' '-3,' or '-4' might be replaced with their Roman equivalent ("UEV-2," and "UEV-II"); -parts of the name might be written in uppercase or lowercase letters ("DDVit-1," and "ddvit1").</p><p>In other cases, there might not be any clear relation between the various synonyms used for gene or protein names, caused in part by the various sub-domains present in biological literature. For example, the protein "lymphocyte associated receptor of death" could be denoted as "LARD," "Apo3," "DR3," "TRAMP," "wsl," and "TnfRSF12" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,127.57,119.85,10.38,8.50" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Various databases and repositories 5  have thus been created, partly to assist searchers in finding gene or protein synonyms (and to provide additional more useful information such as gene functions, biological processes, protein sequences or structures). Constructing and updating these information sources would require a great deal of manual input, but they might prove to be useful in our domain-specific query expansions. We know however that these specific and valuable knowledge sources would not contain all the synonyms of any given protein or gene name. A complete description of our domain-specific queries can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,105.03,256.41,10.33,8.50">[7]</ref>. Some of the following examples will be useful in understanding our purposes. Topic #113 contains the gene name "MMS2" and the system automatically adds the following orthographic variants: "MMS II," "mms 2," and "mms2." Additionally, the domain-specific query expansion process found the related term "UBE2V2," and this term along with its list of synonyms ("UBE2V 2," "ube2v 2," "UBE2V II," "ube2v ii," "ube2v2") were thus added to the final expanded query.  Expanded Query #111 is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,472.62,135.15,3.68,8.50" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, which lists all added synonyms (under the label &lt;EXP&gt;), including closely related spellings ("PrP" and "PRP," or "PrP33-35C" and "prp3-335c"), as well as certain definitions or synonyms ("prion protein").</p><p>These added terms do not occur in the collection with the same document frequency (in fact, we have no guarantee that these added terms even appear in the corpus). For example, the term "prion" (shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,484.93,230.07,4.06,8.50" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) appears in 4,112 MEDLINE records, while the term "prp" in 2,711 ("prpc" in 679, "ascr" in 57, "prip " in 22 and "prp27-30" in 19). The terms "prp33-5c" and "mgc26679" however do not occur at all in the corpus. For the additional terms, document frequency seems to be lower than in the original query (with some exceptions, such as "protein," occurring in 858,669 records).</p><p>An inspection of the entire original query set shows that there were 219 search terms (or 4.38 terms per query) occurring in at least one document <ref type="foot" coords="4,456.60,346.45,2.92,5.09" target="#foot_1">6</ref> . Based upon the document frequency of these search terms, the average document frequency was 160,628.5 (minimum: 1; maximum: 1,814,074 (term "t"); median: 32,194; and standard deviation: 308,456).</p><p>In our domain-specific query expansion, we added 468 terms, and from this set there were 81 terms that did not appear in the corpus at all. The difference in retrieval performance was due to the 387 remaining terms only. When a query was expanded (for 36 queries over a total of 50), on average the system added 13.0 new search terms per query (or 10.74 when ignoring terms not occurring in the corpus). Upon computing the document frequency of these 387 new terms, we found the average document frequency to be 65,912.1 (minimum: 1; maximum: 3,283,925 (term "human"); median: 1,092; and standard deviation: 221,453). Clearly theses values tend to confirm our first impression: the frequencies of words added by our domain-specific query expansion approach were, on average, lower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Blind-Query Expansion</head><p>Various general query expansion approaches have been suggested, and in this paper we will compare our domainspecific query expansion with Rocchio's scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="4,508.28,625.41,10.38,8.50" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. In this latter case, the system was allowed to add m terms extracted from the k best ranked documents from the original query. New queries were derived by applying the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,68.94,105.47,217.80,21.43">Q' = α . Q + (β/k) . ∑ = k j 1 ij w (4)</formula><p>in which Q' denotes the new query built for the previous query Q, and w ij denotes the indexing term weight attached to the term t j in the document D i . In our evaluation, we fixed α = 2.0, β = 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">EVALUATION</head><p>To evaluate our various IR schemes, we adopted noninterpolated mean average precision (MAP) to measure retrieval performance. This was computed by the TREC_EVAL program, based on the retrieval of 1,000 items per request. To statistically determine whether or not a given search strategy would be better than another, we applied the bootstrap methodology <ref type="bibr" coords="5,196.13,276.51,10.33,8.50" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In our statistical testing, the null hypothesis H 0 states that both retrieval schemes result in similar mean performances. Thus this null hypothesis plays the role of a devil's advocate, meaning this assumption would be accepted if two retrieval schemes returned statistically similar means, otherwise it would be rejected. In the tables included in this paper, we have thus underlined any statistically significant differences resulting from a twosided non-parametric bootstrap test, based on the MAP difference (significance level 5%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">IR Models &amp; Stemming Evaluation</head><p>Based on this evaluation methodology, Table <ref type="table" coords="5,248.79,428.97,4.87,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref> depicts the MAP for the MEDLINE collection subset, using different IR models. In this table, the best performance under a given condition (depicted in bold) will be used as the baseline for statistical testing. The first column lists the IR models tested, while the second to sixth columns contain evaluations of the different stemming approaches.</p><p>As a first stemming procedure, we may assume that stemming must be discarded and the indexing of requests and documents would therefore ignore this word normalization procedure (performance shown under the label "None" in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,146.21,558.03,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</p><p>For the English language, we may use either the Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,98.11,584.67,10.33,8.50" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, having about 60 rules, or the Lovins stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,95.71,596.07,16.32,8.50" target="#b10">[10]</ref> based on about 260 rules. The SMART system proposed a third approach based in part on the Lovins scheme, but producing different stems. These three approaches are relatively aggressive, removing both inflectional and derivational suffixes.</p><p>It seemed reasonable to assume that inflectional endings, used to indicate genre (masculine vs. feminine) or number (singular vs. plural), would not really modify the meaning of a given word. For example the words "algorithms" and "algorithm" are closely related and thus if one of them appears in a query and the other in a document, we would assume that both word variants refer to the same meaning and that the corresponding document should be retrieved. if final is '-ies' but not '-eies' or '-aies' then replace '-ies' by '-y', return; if final is '-es' but not '-aes', '-ees' or '-oes' then replace '-es' by '-e', return; if final is '-s' but not '-us' or '-ss' then remove '-s'; return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 5. Minimal S-stemmer [11]</head><p>Of course in English, as in other natural languages, there are exceptions to this rule (e.g., words appearing only in plural form, such as "scissors"). Matches obtained from words derived by adding suffixes (e.g. '-ment', '-ably', 'ship') would however be more questionable. For example, "algorithm" and "algorithmic" do not have the same meanings. Thus it might be in our interest to propose a simple and light stemming approach, one that simply removes the most important inflectional suffixes, such as the plural '-s' form for the English language. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,333.79,360.33,4.87,8.50">5</ref> lists an approach suggested by Harman <ref type="bibr" coords="5,503.42,360.33,16.32,8.50" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="5,333.79,371.73,4.87,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref> lists its corresponding retrieval performance under the "S-stemmer" heading.</p><p>The various stemming approaches are evaluated in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,333.79,409.77,3.65,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, showing that the I(n)L2 probabilistic model provided the best retrieval performance. The underlined values in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,371.79,432.51,4.87,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref> show that the MAP differences between the various IR models are always statistically significant.</p><p>In order to verify whether or not a stemming procedure might statistically improve mean average precision, the second column without stemming (label "None") was used as the baseline. To limit the number of comparisons, we no longer considered the "bnn-bnn" and "nnn-nnn" IR models, since as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,438.98,516.09,3.68,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, both of which resulted in poor retrieval effectiveness.</p><p>Upon comparing these nine best performing IR models, we found that of the four models (Okapi, "ltn-ntc," "lncltc," and "ltc-ltc"), the S-stemmer proved to be the best approach, while the SMART stemmer performed best for only one model (namely I(n)L2 which was also the best performing approach listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,453.13,599.61,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). For these three IR models ("dtu-dtn," "atn-ntc," and "ntc-ntc"), ignoring the stemming procedure proved to be the best solution.</p><p>After averaging MAP values across these nine best performing models, we found an average of 0.1939 for the "None" approach, 0.1933 when using the S-stemmer, 0.1899 with the Porter, 0.1894 with the SMART, and 0.1789 for the Lovins scheme. From these average values or when considering the MAP of the two best performing models (namely Okapi and I(n)L2 in evident performance difference between an IR system with or without stemming is rather small. Moreover, the performance differences between the various stemming schemes are also small. Although the Lovins approach does however seem to perform as well as approaches without a stemming phase, these differences are not statistically significant (except for the "ntc-ntc" model).</p><p>Based on this test-collection, MAP differences between an approach without stemming and five different stemming schemes are usually not statistically significant. With this test-collection, stemming approaches do not improve mean average precision. For the "ntc-ntc" IR model however, the difference between an approach without stemming and the five stemming schemes is always statistically significant, and favors an approach without stemming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">High Precision Evaluation</head><p>It was assumed that a light stemming approach such as the S-stemmer would produce better results during high precision searches. To verify this hypothesis, we computed the precision achieved following the retrieval of ten documents, for each of the four stemming approaches (mean average precision is depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,229.54,558.69,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</p><p>These MAP values listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,193.77,573.93,4.87,8.50" target="#tab_6">6</ref> show that the I(n)L2 model performed best, using the Porter or SMART stemmer. The second best performance was obtained from the Okapi model, using the Porter stemmer. For the last five IR models only, the best performance was achieved either with the S-stemmer or with an approach that ignored the stemming phase (under the label "None" in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,262.84,642.21,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, when the I(n)L2 model was used as a baseline, the performance differences with the Okapi or "Lnu-ltc" model were not statistically significant when considering the four different stemming approaches. The last five IR models however always had statistically lower performance levels when compared to the precision obtained by the I(n)L2 probabilistic model (values underlined in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,388.01,311.24,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_6">6</ref>). </p></div>

Under this indexing restriction, the overall retrieval performance was lower than the corresponding system with manually assigned descriptors (2nd column in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,149.04,153.99,3.53,8.50" target="#tab_7">7</ref>). When taking the nine best performing IR models into account, average percent decreases were about 9.3% when the search system did not include the MeSH headings. These performance differences were usually statistically significant, except for the "ntc-ntc" model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Evaluating Query Expansion Models</head><p>As explained in Section 4, we designed a domain-specific query expansion scheme. In order to compared this search strategy with the more classic Rocchio scheme, we used the Okapi and I(n)L2 probabilistic models and applied different parameter settings. Rows starting with "k doc / m terms" indicate the number of top-ranked documents and the number of terms used to enlarge the original query. The remaining rows indicate the corresponding MAP values achieved by the three query expansion approaches. This parameter setting was of course only applied to the Rocchio scheme. As explained in Section 4.1, the domainspecific query expansion will add, in mean, 10 new terms to each query.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models &amp; parameters</head><p>We were surprised to learn that both query expansion approaches resulted in lower MAP values.</p><p>When compared with the baseline (performance achieved without query expansion) and when using the Rocchio's scheme, differences were however usually not statistically significant. For the domain-specific query expansion, only 36 queries were expanded. If we only consider this query subset, mean average precision for the I(n)L2 model is 0.2906 without query expansion, and with our domainspecific query expansion a MAP of 0.2211, a relative decrease of -23.9%. A query-by-query analysis revealed that our domain-specific query expansion improved the retrieval performance for 13 queries, but decreased performance for other 36 queries.</p></div>

Within this scheme, we normalized the retrieval status values (or document scores) for each document D k provided by the ith result list, as computed by the following formula: Z-score RSV k = α i .

In this data combination, the first result list is simply the "UniNeHug2" run. The second was provided by the IR model I(n)L2, involving both our domain-specific and Rocchio (10 documents / 20 terms) query expansion approaches. The 4th row in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,448.52,671.01,4.87,8.50" target="#tab_9">9</ref> lists our evaluation of this IR scheme, showing a performance level of 0.2150. When fusing this result list with UniNeHug2, we fixed the coefficients α i = 1 for the UniNeHug2 run and α i = 1.5 for the 4th run.</p><note type="other">IR</note><p>The MAP (0.2375) of the resulting combined run ("UniNeHug2c") was slightly inferior to that of the best single model (MAP: 0.2439).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>During the TREC-2005 Genomic evaluation campaign, we evaluated five different stemming procedures.</p><p>The empirical evidence collected shows that when stemming procedures are applied to the MEDLINE collection, retrieval effectiveness improvements are not statistically significant. Differences in performance between the various stemmers are also usually not statistically significant. Moreover, when analyzing high precision searches (measured by average precision after 10 documents), we discovered that a light stemming approach does not perform better than the other more aggressive stemmers.</p><p>The inclusion of the MeSH headings when indexing the scientific articles improves retrieval performance significantly by about 9%, on average. Compared to other similar test-collections however, this enhancement is rather limited.</p><p>During this evaluation campaign, we also proposed a domain-specific query expansion. Both our domainspecific and Rocchio query expansion techniques did not however result in higher retrieval performance (although with the Rocchio scheme the performance difference is not always statistically significant).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,63.42,204.74,62.00,7.63;2,65.64,214.46,8.75,7.63;2,63.42,224.18,53.61,7.63;2,63.42,233.96,214.37,7.63;2,63.42,243.68,132.00,7.63;2,63.42,253.46,45.56,7.63;2,63.42,263.18,216.60,7.63;2,63.42,272.96,206.77,7.63;2,63.42,282.68,207.05,7.63;2,63.42,292.40,210.87,7.63;2,63.42,302.18,67.81,7.63;2,65.64,311.90,48.22,7.63;2,65.64,321.68,63.96,7.63;2,65.64,331.40,72.28,7.63;2,65.64,341.12,62.93,7.63;2,65.64,350.90,30.96,7.63;2,65.64,360.62,53.33,7.63;2,65.64,370.40,113.50,7.63;2,65.64,380.12,90.06,7.63;2,65.64,389.84,49.45,7.63;2,65.64,399.62,139.25,7.63;2,65.64,409.34,49.37,7.63;2,65.64,419.12,108.79,7.63;2,65.64,428.84,41.78,7.63;2,65.64,438.56,115.51,7.63;2,65.64,448.34,39.31,7.63;2,65.64,458.06,102.72,7.63;2,65.64,467.84,127.80,7.63;2,65.64,477.56,87.57,7.63;2,65.64,487.28,52.00,7.63;2,65.64,497.06,144.36,7.63;2,67.86,506.78,8.75,7.63"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>TI -Concerning the localization of steroids in centrioles and basal bodies by immunofluorescence.
