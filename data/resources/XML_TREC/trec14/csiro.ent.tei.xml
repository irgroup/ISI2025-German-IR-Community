<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The primary goals of the CSIRO and ANU team's participation in the enterprise track were two-fold: 1) to investigate how well our search engine PADRE responds to the new collection and the new tasks, and 2) to explore if document structure specific to an email collection can be used to improve system performance.</p><p>By the time of submission deadline, we completed two tasks: known-item search and discussion search. For both tasks, we used the PADRE retrieval system [1], in which the Okapi BM25 relevance function was implemented. Each message in the collection was treated as an independent document, so both topic distillation scoring and same site suppression mechanism were turned off (i.e. -nocool and -SSS0 respectively). During the indexing, stemming and stopword elimination were not applied and sequences of letters and/or digits were considered as indexable words.</p><p>We parsed the HTML pages in the original collection into an XML format (the DTD is shown in the appendix), and removed non-email pages. Our parsed collection includes 174,311 email messages, and we used this collection for our experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.Known-item search task</head><p>The known item search task is aimed at finding an important email that is known to exist. We tried seven runs and submitted five runs for this task. Table <ref type="table" coords="1,364.76,447.00,5.49,9.88">1</ref> summarises the indexing and the retrieval environment for the five submitted runs.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="1,153.69,484.98,4.28,9.88">1</ref>: Indexing and retrieval settings for the known-item task Run ID Index Query Weighting csiroanuki1</p><p>The email structure was ignored and all elements were treated as content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title</head><p>Okapi BM25 csiroanuki2</p><p>The email structure was used: from, subject, to, cc and date were indexed as metadata; the texts in all other elements were treated as content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title</head><p>Okapi BM25 + subject text is up-weighted csiroanuki3 Similar to csiroanuki2, but quoted and forwarded message fragments and signature were ignored and excluded from the content. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As in csiroanuki2</head><p>To make use of metadata in the run csiroanuki3, we transformed two types of queries. 1) Queries containing a name: whenever a person's name was detected in the topic title, the person's name was quoted and his/her email address(es) was added to the query. For example, the title of the topic 69 official introduction to Dan Connolly, was transformed to official introduction to "Dan Connolly" [a:connolly@hal.com a:connolly@www10.w3.org a:connolly@w3.org]. According to PADRE's query language, this query would be transformed internally to: retrieve the email that contains one or more terms from "official introduction to 'Dan Connolly'" with connolly@hal.com, connolly@www10.w3.org or connolly@w3.org in the "author" metadata class (i.e. the "from" element). 2) Queries containing dates: the abbreviation of the month was added. E.g. the title of topic 139, W3C talks in April 2004, was transformed to: w3c talks in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.55,188.70,70.46,9.88">[apr april] 2004</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,130.26,310.08,5.49,9.88" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the performance of each run. In terms of the MRR measure, all the test runs csiroanuki2, 3, 5 and 6 are better than the base run csiroanuki1 (among them, csiroanuki3 and csiroanuki5 are significantly better than the run csiroanuki1 (p &lt; 0.04 for the paired, two tailed t-test)). The run csiroanuki5 achieved highest MRR while a simple strategy, ignoring the quoted and forwarded text and up-weighting the subject text, was adopted here. Nevertheless, the MRR of csiroanuki5 is lower than the median of all participants' runs by 8%.</p><p>The known-item message appears in the top ten for more than three quarters of the topics. All runs tend to succeed and fail at the same topics. For example, all runs failed to get the known-item for the same set of ten topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.Discussion search task</head><p>The discussion search task was to search for messages pro and con in an argument/discussion regarding to a topic. Again we submitted five runs (from nine). The indexing and the retrieval environment for each run are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,290.91,490.68,4.12,9.88" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Csiroanuds1 is our base run; its setting is very much like the csiroanuki1 in the above known-item task. As in the discussion search task "a correct answer is an email which contributes a pro or con relating to the topic, in new (not quoted) text", we ignored the quoted text, forwarded text and the signature for the run 3, 5, 7 and 8.</p><p>In runs csiroanuds1, 3, and 7, we took the text from the query field of a topic as a query, and made minimal modifications to use PADRE's syntax. (For example, for the topic DS33, plug-in patent, our fed query is "plug-in" patent as our search engine tends to separate the two words plug and in if they are not quoted.) Csiroanuds5 used a disjunctive form: the query was constructed as a disjunction of terms to attempt to increase recall at the expense of precision.</p><p>As the discussion task encourages high recall, in the run csiroanuds8 we adopted the traditional pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm for query expansion according to the following steps:</p><p>1) An initial list of ranked message was obtained by using the original query field of a topic; 2) All terms in the first ten documents were ranked according to the following term selection value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,272.52,289.80,78.31,14.38">TSV = w (1) * r/R</formula><p>The weight w ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,168.68,306.96,4.28,9.88">1</ref>) is the Robertson/Sparck Jones weight:</p><p>where r is the number of messages that contain the term, R is the number of selected messages, n is the number of documents containing the term, and N is the number of messages in the collection.</p><p>3) The top 20 terms that were not in the original query were added to the original query, and the new added terms were down weighted by a factor of 3. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,128.90,448.32,4.12,9.88" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,171.11,448.32,5.49,9.88">1</ref> and 2 show the performance of all runs. Overall, all the test runs (csiroanuds3, csiroanuds5, csiroanuds7 and csiroanuds8) are worse than the base run csiroanuds1 in terms of any measure. The common difference between the four testing runs and the base run is that the quoted and forwarded text are ignored in the four testing runs as we thought that might help to retrieve new text, obviously this strategy does not help. Probably we should have kept quoted and forwarded text in those messages that have new text.</p><p>Considering the performance next best to the base run is run csiroanuds7, and the other three test runs have worse performance than run csiroanuds7, the query and weighting variations in these three runs (e.g. expanded query or disjunction query, up-weighting the subject text) do not appear to help here either. After the evaluation judgments are released from NIST, we could test if these query and weighting strategies work for the index method as in run csiroanuds1.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.Discussion</head><p>For known-item search, a simple strategy, ignoring the quoted and forwarded text and up-weighting the subject text, achieved the highest MRR. For the discussion search task, all our test runs performed poorer than the base run that simply ignored email structure and treated all elements equally. Maybe there are bigger gains to be made from considering email-specific features like thread structure.</p><p>We observed that the format of the email archives (in HTML) has caused some difficulties to the task of email retrieval. This has led to some groups returning non-email pages for judging. We expect that should be easier next year though now that several teams have parsed the HTML and extracted email from it.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,178.79,281.66,265.79,9.88"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
