<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The purpose of the ad hoc retrieval task of Genomics track at TREC 2005 is to provide systems with better-defined queries (each query is derived from a generic topic template which includes a certain number of semantic types) for finding genomics information <ref type="bibr" coords="1,497.92,553.56,12.16,10.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The topics in the 2005 ad hoc retrieval task were collected from real biologists and are more structured than the mostly free-form topics from the 2004 track. Totally 50 topics, derived from 5 generic topic templates (GTTs) <ref type="foot" coords="1,271.50,595.79,4.00,7.19" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , each of which has 10 instances, are provided. Participants are expected to build systems to find information about these 50 topics from a 10-year MEDLINE subset, which includes 4,591,008 documents from year 1994 to 2003. This report will first introduce our retrieval strategy, including preprocessing, MeSH term identification, OKAPI, query expansion, and concept-based ranking. Next, the experiment results on the sample queries are reported. In the section of conclusion and future work, some improvements are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retrieval strategy</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,112.45,165.06,5.81,10.46">1</ref> shows the whole query processing procedure. In the process, PubMed, MeSH 2005, and Entrez gene are used to expand the query. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MeSH term Identification</head><p>The PubMed Automatic Term Mapping [4] is used to retrieve MeSH terms. The mapping between terms in user' s queries and MeSH terms in PubMed is done through its MeSH Translation Table . It compares terms from a query with lists of terms in its translation table, which contains: 1) MeSH Headings.</p><p>2) MeSH Subheadings: Used by NLM to further describe a certain aspect of a MeSH heading. For example , the MeSH heading "Liver" may be qualified with the subheading "drug-effects" (the PubMed query will be " liver [mh] AND de[sh]") to indicate that the article is not about the liver in general, but about the effect of drugs on the liver. 3) Synonyms of MeSH headings and subheadings in UMLS. In our experiment, the queries were searched in PubMed through its ESearch E-utility and MeSH terms were extracted by parsing the returned XML file. For example, Table <ref type="table" coords="3,474.44,376.56,5.81,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the PubMed translation of the query "purification of rat IgM". Table <ref type="table" coords="3,111.14,422.31,4.17,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>: An example of PubMed automatic term mapping (three MeSH terms are extracted: "immunoglobulin m", "i solation and purification", and " rats" . These MeSH terms will be used for query expansion.) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Okapi weighting</head><p>Okapi relevance scoring formula <ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.86,723.06,11.52,10.46" target="#b3">[6]</ref> is known to embody a good model of relevance based upon term occurrences within text documents. The version in our experiment is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,182.25,121.97,247.52,33.79">qtf k qtf k tf K tf k w Q T T + + + + ∑ ∈ 3 3 1 ) 1 ( ) 1 (<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Q is a query, containing term</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,81.00,165.06,348.77,79.63">T T w is the weight of T in Q ) 5 . 0 /( ) 5 . 0 ( ) 5 . 0 /( ) 5 . 0 ( log + + - - + - + - + = r R n N r n r R r w T (2)</formula><p>N=4,591,008 is the number of documents in the collection. n is the number of documents containing the term. R is the number of documents known to be relevant to a specific topic and r is the number of relevant documents containing the term. Since R and r are not known in our experiment, formula (2) can be simplified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,78.75,327.48,356.02,75.30">) 5 . 0 5 . 0 log( + + - = n n N w T (3) K is ) ) 1 (( 1 avdl dl b b k × + - × k1=1.2, b=0</formula><p>.75 are the constants used in experiments reported here. dl is the length of the document and avdl=183.5554 is the average document length. tf is the frequency of occurrence of the term within a specific document. qtf is the frequency of the term within the topic from which Q was derived. qtf =1 is a constant in our experiment. So formula (1) can be modified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,182.25,469.22,244.52,32.82">∑ ∈ + + Q T T tf K tf k w ) 1 ( 1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For each term, its OKAPI weight in each document ( tf K tf k w T + + ) 1 ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,363.75,525.33,3.42,6.16" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) was pre-computed and stored. The data structure is as follows:</p><p>Term, DocFrq, PubMedID 1 :OKAPIscore| PubMedID 2 :OKAPIscore |……| PubMedID k :OKAPIscore</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Query expansion</head><p>Once the MeSH terms in the original queries were extracted, the MeSH 2005 database was used to expand the original query. The synonyms (also known as entry terms) for MeSH terms were added into the query. For example:</p><p>MeSH term: Immunoglobulin M Added Synonyms: "Gamma Globulin, 19S", IgM, IgM1, IgM2</p><p>As long as any of these terms appears in a document, we consider this concept appears in that document. Besides the MeSH terms, the gene names were also expanded by adding their aliases in the Entrez Gene da tabase<ref type="foot" coords="5,230.25,147.29,4.00,7.19" target="#foot_1">5</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="5,238.50,150.06,11.19,10.46" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. For example:</p><p>Gene name: BRCA1 Added aliases: BRCAI, IRIS, PSCP, RNF53 Like the MeSH terms, occurring of any of these terms in a document will be counted as one occurrence of this gene in that document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Ranking</head><p>The similarity between a d ocument and a query has two components: one is concept similarity and the other term similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,207.00,334.89,178.50,14.66">) _ , _ ( ) , ( sim term sim concept D Q sim =</formula><p>The concept similarity is the sum of all the concept weights in the query.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,78.75,383.95,267.82,111.13">∑ ∈ = Q C C w sim concept _ where Q is a query, containing concepts C C w is the weight of C in Q n N w C log =</formula><p>where N=4,591,008 is the number of documents in the collection. n is the number of documents containing the concept or any of its synonyms. For example, gene BRCA1 is a concept and it has a set of synonyms (BRCAI , IRIS, PSCP, RNF53). The number of documents having concept BRCA1 is computed with the following PubMed Boolean search:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="5,78.75,575.30,434.99,22.75">BRCA1[Text Word] OR BRCAI[Text Word] OR IRIS[Text Word] OR PSCP[Text Word] OR RNF53[Text Word].</formula><p>Totally 2,267 documents are retrieved. This number is the document frequency of concept BRCA1. Notice that BRCAI, IRIS, PSCP , RNF53 are assigned the same weight as BRCA1.</p><p>For example, document D 1 has BRCA1 , D 2 has IRIS, and the query has BRCA1. According to our weighting strategy, D 1 and D 2 get the same weight on this concept. Notice that concepts in the title, MeSH, or EC/RN field are likely to describe the topics of a document. Based on this observation, more weight is assigned to those concepts occurring in these fields. For example, suppose concept C is an indexing MeSH term in document D , the weight of C in D will be</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="6,247.50,150.07,99.12,26.95">) log( ) 1 ( n N w C × + = α</formula><p>α is a parameter to adjust. In our experiment, α is equal to 0.3 when C is a major MeSH term and 0.2 when C is a concept in the title, MeSH, or EC/RN number field.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="6,80.25,211.97,250.06,32.82">sim term _ is computed with formula (4) ( ∑ ∈ + + Q T T tf K tf k w ) 1 ( 1</formula><p>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment result</head><p>10 sample topics, with two coming from each genetic topic template, were provided for participants to evaluate their systems. We use the trec_eval program to compute the 11-point average precision. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,186.08,447.81,5.81,10.46" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows that our method has achieved 0.4002 average precision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis:</head><p>Query 91: "Describe the procedure or methods for GST fusion protein expression in Sf9 insect cells." 43/56 relevant documents were missed. These 43 documents have "baculoviridae" or "baculovirus", instead of "Sf9".</p><p>Query 93: "Provide information about the role of the gene DRD4 in the disease Alcoholism." 4/37 relevant documents were missed. 1/4 (9691193) has "d4 dopamine receptor", instead of "receptors, dopamine d4". 1/4 (9285967) has 'dopa mine D4 receptor', instead of 'receptors, dopamine d4". 2/4 (9406938, 11697748) have "dopamine receptor" and "d4", but they are not adjacent.</p><p>Query 94: "Provide information on the role of the gene HMG in the process of chromatin restructuring and transcriptional regulation." 40/66 relevant documents were missed. These 42 documents have "transcriptional activation" or "transcriptional activity", or "transcriptional activator", instead of "transcriptional regulation".</p><p>Query 95: "Provide information on the role of the gene Insulin receptor gene in the process of signaling tumorigenesis." 8/30 relevant documents were missed. 1/8 (14556818) doesn't have "signaling tumorigenesis". For the other 7 documents, both "Insulin receptor" and "signaling tumorigenesis" can be found. However, they either only occur in the abstracts, or in the MeSH field (not as major MeSH terms).</p><p>Query 98: "Provide information about Mutation of Ret in thyroid function." 12/220 relevant documents were missed. 9/12 documents have "Ret onc ogene protein, Drosophila" as an EC/RN number, but not "Ret". (You get 1,152 documents when you search "Ret oncogene protein, Drosophila"[Substance Name] in PubMed. However, no documents are returned when you search "Ret" [Substance Name]. ) 3/12 documents don't have concept "mutation". For the official topics, only those documents that have at least one of the concepts in the query were retrieved. For each topic, up to 1,000 documents were retrieved. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,464.32,641.31,5.81,10.46" target="#tab_4">3</ref> gives the results: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future work 1. Domain-specific knowledge</head><p>The major difficulty comes from the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Each query is asking for information about a certain aspect of a topic. Relevant article must describe some specific role of the gene in the stated disease.</p><p>3 Find articles describing the role of a gene in a specific biological process.</p><p>Relevant article must describe some specific role of the gene in the stated biological process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Using MeSH subheadings</head><p>MeSH subheadings are used to further describe a certain aspect of a MeSH heading. For example, the MeSH heading "Liver" may be qualified with the subheading "drug-effects" to indicate tha t the article is not about the liver in general, but about the effect of drugs on the liver.</p><p>For the query, using MeSH subheadings will help identify a specific aspect of the query topic.</p><p>For template 1, the appropriate subheading is " Methods" , which is used for MEDLINE indexing "with techniques, procedures, and programs for methods" [2]. For other templates (2, 3, 4, and 5), the suitable subheading is " Genetics", which is used "for mechanisms of heredity and the genetics of organisms, for the genetic basis of normal and pathologic states, and for the genetic aspects of endogenous chemicals. It includes biochemical and molecular influence on genetic material." <ref type="bibr" coords="9,235.50,607.56,12.13,10.46">[2]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,293.21,607.56,5.81,10.46" target="#tab_6">5</ref> lists the combined MeSH heading/MeSH subheading for sample query 92-99: To do it automatically, we first identify MeSH terms in the query (see section " MeSH term Identification"). If the MeSH term can be qualified with subheading " Genetics" (Notice: each MeSH term is associated with a list of subheadings), we assign more weight to those documents that are indexed with the combination of that MeSH term and " Genetics" 2) Using UMLS semantic relations Finding appropriate MeSH subheadings is one way to narrow down the search to a specific aspect of the query topic. On the other hand, if we know what the specific aspect could be, we can search them in the document title or abstract. For example, if some resource gives all the possible roles genes can have on diseases in general, we can search those specific roles in the document title or abstract, instead of searching the word " role" . UMLS semantic relations can be used in this situation. The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has integrated more than 100 biomedical information resources, with more than 900,000 concepts (biomedical meanings). These concepts are categorized and related to each other by the UMLS Semantic Network. A semantic type in the Semantic Network is a category assigned to concepts based on their intrinsic and functional properties. For example, " kidney" is a "Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component" and "Sexuality" is a Behavior. The current release of the Semantic Network contains 135 semantic types. These semantic types denote physical objects, ideas, activities, biologic functions, anatomical structural, and chemicals. The UMLS semantic relations can be grouped into five categories: physical (e.g., "Tissue" connected_to "Body Part,Organ, or Organ Component"), functional (e.g., "Virus" causes "Pathologic Function"), spatial (e.g., "Fungus" location_of "Enzyme" ), temporal (e.g., "Genetic Function" co-occurs_with "Mental Process") or conceptual (e.g., "Disease or Syndrome" degree_of "Mental or Beha vioral Dysfunction"). In our experiment, only functional and temporal semantic relations are used.</p><p>Step 1: Identify concepts and their semantic types in each topic template For example, two concepts are mapped in topic template 2: "Role of gene" maps to concept "gene function". The semantic type of " gene function" is " genetic function" ; "Disease" is a concept and its semantic type is "Disease or Syndrome".</p><p>Step 2: Retrieve semantic relations between the semantic types from UMLS semantic network. Only temporal and functional relations are considered. Continue the above example, the relations between "genetic function" and "Disease or Syndrome" in UMLS are: " Affects" , " process_of " , and " result_of " are all functional relations.</p><p>Step 3: Extract the more specific relations in the definition of each semantic relation. For example, " Affects" is defined in the UMLS as: "Produces a direct effect on. Implied here is the altering or influencing of an existing condition, state, situation, or entity. This includes has a role in, alters, influences, predisposes, catalyzes, stimulates, regulates, depresses, impedes, enhances, contributes to, leads to, and modifies." By looking for the word " includes" in the definition, those more specific types of " Affects" are exacted: "has a role in", "alters", "influences", "predisposes", "catalyzes", "stimulates", "regulates", "depresses", "impedes", "enhances", "contributes to", "leads to", and "modifies".</p><p>Step 4: Add the more specific relations into the original query. They are ORed together and added as ordinary terms, not as concepts. For the above example, the added relations will be:</p><p>has a role in |alters|influences|predisposes|catalyzes|stimulates |regulates| depresses|impedes|enhances| contributes to|leads to|modifies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Gene name disambiguation</head><p>The ambiguity of gene symbols is substantial, not only because one symbol may denote multiple genes but particularly because many symbols have other, non-gene meanings. For example, gene APC also has many non-gene meanings, such as "Antigen Presenting Cells", or "Activated Protein C", or "Argon Plasma Coagulation". These two types of ambiguity provide a great challenge for information retrieval. Recent studies include <ref type="bibr" coords="11,441.66,633.81,12.22,10.46" target="#b4">[7]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="11,480.43,633.81,12.22,10.46" target="#b5">[8]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,500.68,633.81,13.19,10.46" target="#b4">[7]</ref> introduced a system, Gpmarkup, which automatically identifies gene/protein names in MEDLINE abstracts and links the names to their synonyms. Their system also disambiguates homonyms (two or more gene/protein names spelled alike but different in meaning) by mapping them to the full forms. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,241.35,694.56,11.52,10.46" target="#b5">[8]</ref> proposed an algorithm to disambiguate homonymous gene symbols by comparing their thesaurus descriptions and the textual contexts in which they occur (MEDLINE abstracts).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Psudeo feedback</head><p>Psudeo feedback has been proved to help query expansion. Those concepts extracted from the top ranked documents can be related and added to the concepts in the query. By relating and adding this kind of concepts to the query may help retrieve more relevant documents. Concepts extracted from the top ranked documents are related to the concepts in the query according to the MeSH hierarchy. The added concepts are either the hyponyms or hypernyms of the query concepts. Hyponyms are weighted the same as the original concept in the query. But the hypernyms are weighted less than the original concept, since they are more general.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,78.75,229.96,436.10,383.57"><head>Query 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>PubMed automatic term mapping is used to identify MeSH terms in queries. 2.

Uninformative terms in the documents and queries were removed according to the PubMed official stop words list, which includes 137 most frequently used terms in PubMed. The Porter stemmer was used to handle lexical variants. For each document or a MEDLINE record, the following fields were used to build a word-level inverted document indexing: Title, Abstract, EC/RN Number 2 , and MeSH 3 . On the other hand, it has been observed that title field and MeSH field are likely to contain those terms that describe the document' s topics, especially the Major MeSH terms 4</p><ref type="bibr" coords="2,78.75,558.06,12.37,10.46" target="#b2">[5]</ref></p>. Based on this observation, a concept-level indexing was created on title, Major MeSH terms, EC/RN Number, and MeSH terms. Concepts defined in our experiment are MeSH terms, their synonyms, and EC/RN numbers. The format of the concept-level indexing is as follows:</p>where</p></note></figure>
