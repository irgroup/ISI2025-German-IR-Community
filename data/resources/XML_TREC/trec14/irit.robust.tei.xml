<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The objective of our participation to the TREC 2005 Robust Task, was to evaluate the use of a conceptual indexing method based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="1,184.35,418.41,11.68,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> lexical database. The technique consists in detecting mono and multiword concepts corresponding to WordNet synsets from both documents and queries. Then these concepts are used as a conceptual indexing space. Terms not identified in WordNet are also added to complete the representation. Even though they are not useful during the expansion phase, they are used to compare documents and queries at the searching stage. This paper is organized as follows. In section2, we describe the synoptic scheme of our system. In section3, the approach is detailed : our method for concept detection and weighting is described. Section4 presents the official evaluation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of the Approach</head><p>In this section, we describe our conceptual indexing method based on WordNet. The principle consists in, being given a document (or a query), mapping it onto WordNet and then indetifying the WordNet concepts (mono and multi terms) from the words used in the text of the document (the query) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,388.99,617.50,10.64,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The extracted concepts are then weighed and tagged using part of speech information (POS) in order to facilitate their expansion.</p><p>The expansion which we qualify Short Expansion (or SE) consists of expanding from the document and/or the queries the mono sense WordNet terms (having only one sense) by using all of their synonyms extracted from the synset 1 they belong to. The indexing method may use expansion and stemming or not <ref type="bibr" coords="2,420.21,76.52,10.58,8.74">[5]</ref>, according to the used run.</p><p>It combines classical keywords indexing to conceptual indexing by adding the terms not recognized by WordNet to the dictionary ? document representation ?.</p><p>A total of five runs were produced for this experiment. They are described in Table2 of section 3.</p><p>In the next section we will explain the main steps of our system which are the concept detection and weighting methods used to carry out our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Detail of the approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Conceps Detection</head><p>Figure1-Description of the indexing method used to generate the different runs.</p><p>Concepts (mono and multi words) identified in WordNet are marked in the document. Concept detection consists in extracting mono and multiword concepts from documents and queries that correspond to nodes (synsets) in WordNet. Formally, let's consider: the initial document composed of n single words. The result of the concept detection process will be a document D c .:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concepts Detection</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concept Weighting</head><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,115.80,262.31,182.64,124.98">Document/Query C 1 #n … … C i #n … w 1 _w</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,193.38,160.02,318.75,10.06">D c = {c 1 , c 2 , …, c m , w' 1 , w' 2,…, w' m' }<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c 1 , c 2 , , c m are concepts identified as entries in WordNet. These concepts could be mono or multiword. It may also happen that single words w' 1 , w' 2,…, w' m' of the initial document (query) do not belong to WordNet vocabulary.</p><p>In that case, they will not be used for expanding the document (the query). However, they will be added to the final document (query) representation in order to be used at the search stage.</p><p>For detecting concepts in the document (query), we use an ad hoc technique that relies solely on the concatenation of adjacent words to identify compound (multiword) concepts of WordNet. In this technique, two alternative ways can be distinguished. The first one suggests to map WordNet on the document (the query) by extracting all multiword concepts from WordNet and then identifying those occurring in the document (query). This method has the advantage of creating a reusable resource. Its drawback is the possibility to omit concepts which appear in the query and in WordNet in different forms. For example, if WordNet contains the multiword concept "solar battery", a simple comparison do not make it possible to identify the same concept appearing in its plural form "solar batteries" in the document or the query. The second way, which we adopt in our experiments, follows the opposite path, mapping the document (query) onto WordNet: for each multiword candidate concept derived by combining adjacent words in the document (query), we first question WordNet using these words just as they are, and then we use their base forms if necessary.</p><p>Concerning word combination, as shown in Figure1, the longest successive word chain for which a concept is detected is selected. In the example of Figure1, the longest concept "chief_operating_officer#n" (#n is used for the POS name) is considered although "chief " and "officer" could also be identified as single word concepts. This concept is defined by WordNet as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,229.21,116.03,13.10,9.31">D=</formula><p>chief executive officer, CEO, chief operating officer --(the corporate executive responsible for the operations of the firm; reports to a board of directors; may appoint other managers (including a president))</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Why using Multiword Concepts?</head><p>The extraction of multiword concepts in plain text is important to reduce ambiguity. These concepts generally are monosemous even though the words they contain can be individually ambiguous. For example, when taking each word separately in the concept ear_nose_and_throat_doctor, we have to disambiguate (according to WordNet) between 5 senses for the word ear, 13 senses (7 for the noun nose and 6 for the verb nose) for the word nose, 3 senses for throat (and is not used because it is a stop-word) and 7 senses (4 for the noun and 3 for the verb) for the word doctor. So, we would have a number of 5x13x3x7= 1365 possible combinations of candidate senses. But when considering all the words forming a single multiword concept (of course, the multiword concept must be recognized by WordNet), we will only have one sense.</p><p>In this example, the full concept (WordNet synset) and its definition (gloss in WordNet) are as follows:</p><p>The noun ear-nose-and-throat doctor has 1 sense 1. ENT man, ear-nose-and-throat doctor, otolaryngologist, otorhinolaryngologist, rhinolaryngologist --(a specialist in the disorders of the ear or nose or throat.)</p><p>Statistics carried on WordNet2.0 presented in Table1, show that, from a total of 63,218 multiword concepts (composed of 2-9 words), 56,286 (89%) of them are monosemous. 6,238 have 2 senses (9.867%) and only 694 (0.506%) multiword concepts have more than 2 senses. Thus, the more there are multiword concepts in a document to be analyzed, the easier is their disambiguation. The extracted concepts are then weighed according to a kind of TF.IDF thatwe name CF.IDF. For a concept c i composed of n words, its frequency in a query equals to the number of occurrences of a concept itself, and the one of all its sub-concepts. Formally:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Example of concept weighting</head><p>Tf we consider the 3 word concept "elastic potential energy" in a given topic, its frequency is computed as follows:</p></div>

For example "costa_rica#n" is a concept that belongs to a WordNet synset identified in the document. Words that are not tagged (like "rojas" in this document example) do not belong to WordNet terminology. The notations "#n", "#a", "#v", "#r" are used to indicate the part of speech (POS) of the terms belonging to WordNet.</p><p>They refer respectively to names, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. At the moment, the POS tag is not used in the index.</p><p>We need it only to expand the identified mono-sense WordNet terms.</p><p>(DOC (DOCNO XIE20000930.0016 )DOCNO (TITLE costa_rica#n n to host#n talks#n for colombian#n peace#n )TITLE (TEXT costa_rican#n n foreign_minister#n n roberto rojas was quote#v by the press#n as saying#n that the meeting#n will#n be hold#v between#r october#n 16 and 18 in the central_american_country#n n but that the site#n had not be#v define#v yet rojas say#v costa_rican#n n president#n miguel angel#n rodriguez had say#v previously#r that costa_rica#n n would help#n colombia#n find#n the peace#n the costa_rican#n n government#n receive#v an official#n communication#n thursday#n from the colombian#n authorities#n authorize#v the meeting#n with representative#n of the revolutionary_armed_forces_of_colombia#n n farc#n and the national_liberation_army#n n eln rojas say#v the country#n will#n have#n an opportunity#n to promote#v its idea#n of agreement#n through#a dialogue#n costa_rica#n n has be#v the scenario#n and also#r play#v a role#n in the peace#n plan#n in central_america#n n and that … )TEXT )DOC</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation</head><p>We submitted five official runs to the Robust task: CKonT, CKonD, CKonTSE, CKSEonD et CKSEonTSE. The runs were carried out by using the title and/or description fields, by performing or not expansion. They are summarized in Table2. In the five (5) runs, WordNet terms are not stemmed, and those not belonging to WordNet are stemmed (classical indexing is used to no WordNet terms). An expansion method, named Short Expansion (SE), can be used to expand queries and/or documents. This method expands mono-sense WordNet terms with their synonyms, ie, with the terms belonging to their synset. The results obtained by the different runs are summarized in Table3. and the corresponding recall precision curves are given in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,149.25,675.75,3.77,8.74" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. It seems that expansion is worth only to find out more documents with a low similarity with the query. The other conclusion that can be drawn is that conceptual indexing brings better results with short and precise queries than with long one. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have evaluated the performances of our conceptual indexing method which consists of matching documents and queries with WordNet. In this method, documents and queries are represented by a set of WordNet senses. The first remark, when comparing our submitted runs, is that a "careful" expansion method when applied for both queries and documents bring the best results. Indeed, this expansion method is made so as to avoid the disambiguation problem (only mono sense terms are expanded). The second remark concerns the use of the Description field. As shown in the results, using Description field in the queries brings better results when the documents of the collection are expanded.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,158.40,697.25,295.27,10.46"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
