<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the aims of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Precision Medicine Initiative is to investigate how a person's genome can inform the treatment of his or her disease. It is hoped that understanding which specific genetic variations contribute to the pathologic process will enable specific drugs to be targeted against those genetic anomalies to precisely manage a patient's disease. Malignant diseases, in particular, have been found in many cases to be associated with a relatively few number of genetic anomalies. Consequently, these diseases are particularly susceptible to a strategy of precise treatment. This has lead to the design of many drugs capable of targeting important genes -and even specific genetic mutations.</p><p>However, as the number of available drugs has multiplied, and as their genetic specificity has increased, it has become increasingly difficult for clinicians to sift through the medical literature to identify potentially useful highly-precise anti-tumor agents. Another consequence of the explosion in the number of gene-targeting drugs is the increase in the number of clinical trials investigating their efficacy against malignancy. Thus, it is becoming increasingly challenging for cancer patients and clinicians to identify drug trials for which they might be eligible.  The 2017 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Precision Medicine Track aims to address the important clinical challenge of providing useful precision-medicine related information to clinicians treating patients with cancer. Specifically, participants are invited to devise automatic and/or manual systems capable of (1) obtaining pertinent scientific articles from the medical literature describing the precise treatment of tumors exhibiting specific genetic mutations of alterations; and (2) identifying clinical studies in the National Library of Medicine (NLM)'s ClinicalTrals.gov database that investigate drugs targeting the patient's malignancy and for which the patient might be eligible.</p><p>In this paper, we present our system designed for the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine Track. As the track specifically emphasizes that retrieved scientific articles and clinical trials should have a focus on treatment, we cast both tasks as a hybrid question answering (Q&amp;A) and information retrieval (IR) problem. Formally, we consider the topic (as exemplified in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,355.31,563.93,3.72,8.85" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) to be asking an implicit question, What is the best treatment for the patient described by the topic? To answer this question, we adapt techniques for Q&amp;A from knowledge bases by generating and using a knowledge graph encoding relationships between drugs, genes, and mutations. This allows us to retrieve articles discussing both the topic and its inferred answers by incorporating an aspect-based retrieval strategy based on rank fusion.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data evaluated in the 2017 TREC Precision Medicine track, Section 3 details our approach, Section 4 describes each of the runs we submitted, Section 5 reports initial results, and Section 6 summarizes the conclusions. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Data</head><p>Two separate document collections were used for the Precision Medicine track: scientific abstracts and clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Scientific Abstracts</head><p>The scientific abstracts considered in Task A originated from two sources: (1) MEDLINE abstracts, and (2) Conference Proceedings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEDLINE Articles</head><p>A January 2017 snapshot of MEDLINE abstracts was used for the scientific abstracts. The task organizers provided both a rich XML and simple textual representation for all abstracts. In this work, we considered the XML representation which provided, in addition to the textual content of the article, a variety of metadata including Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), keywords, and a controlled vocabulary of studied chemical compounds.</p><p>Conference Proceedings Because many of the topics evaluated in TREC PM were highly specific, the organizers also included abstracts of articles published in the proceedings of the annual meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). These articles were included with the intent to provide potentially relevant reports/articles describing precision medicine studies which are not included in MEDLINE.</p><p>It should be noted that only a simple textual representation of articles presented at AACR/ASCO was available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Registered Clinical Trials</head><p>For Task B, a snapshot of ClinicalTrials.gov obtained in April 2017 was considered. As with MEDLINE, both a rich XML and simple textual representation of each clinical trial was provided by the organizers. In this work, we considered the XML representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Approach</head><p>Our system, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,454.71,486.59,3.48,8.85">2</ref>, includes both "on-line" steps (i.e., steps applied for each topic) and "off-line" steps (steps applied before any topics are considered). In terms of on-line processing, the system has three mandatory steps:</p><p>1. Topic Analysis. The structured information of a given topic is analyzed to determine its main components or aspects; 2. Topic Expansion. The various aspects of the topic are expanded using external resources; 3. Document Retrieval. The aspects of the topic are represented as queries, and a set of ranked documents, i.e., scientific articles or clinical trials (depending on whether the system is configured for Task A or B), is retrieved; and as well as two "optional" steps designed to improve the quality of retrieved documents: 4. Aspect Fusion (Optional). The ranked documents separately retrieved for each aspect of the topic are combined or fused together;</p><p>5. Similarity Fusion (Optional). The ranked documents retrieved using multiple similarity measures (i.e., relevance models) are fused together.</p><p>In terms of off-line processing, the system relies on the availability of three data structures: (a) the Precision Medicine Drug Graph (PMDG), (b) an index of scientific articles, and (c) an index of clinical trials. In the remainder of this section we describe the off-line steps used to create the above data structures, followed by the on-line steps of our system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Building the Precision Medicine Drug Graph</head><p>Knowledge about the interactions between disease, genes, and drugs is available in a large variety of disconnected knowledge bases. Consequently, to unlock this knowledge, we create a unified knowledge graph which we refer to as the Precision Medicine Drug Graph (PMDG). The PMDG aggregates a subset of information from a variety of knowledge sources, including the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.26,508.41,10.44,8.85" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, FDA Labels, as well as the 15 data sources incorporated within the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,109.44,532.32,10.44,8.85" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,145.47,544.28,3.35,8.85" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the PMDG represents drugs, genes, and mutations as nodes. The PMDG encodes both binary relations such as HER2</p><p>Has-Synonym ----------→ neu, as well as ternary relations such as (EGFR, T790M) <ref type="figure" coords="3,177.87,586.74,78.78,8.60">-----------------→</ref> imatinib. Specifically, the PMDG encodes four types of relations: (1) drug synonyms, (2) gene synonyms, (3) that a gene and locus confer resistance to a drug, and (4) that a drug can target (e.g. regulate) a specific gene and (possibly) a locus. In our system, the PMDG is used for both Topic Analysis and Topic Expansion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Indexing the Data</head><p>We maintain two separate indices corresponding to the two tasks evaluated in the track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Indexing for Task A</head><p>For task A, we maintain an tiered index including both MED-LINE articles and articles published in AACR/ASCO Proceedings. Because the MEDLINE articles are available in a rich XML format and the AACR/ASCO proceedings are only available as text, the indexing strategy varies for each dataset.</p><p>Indexing MEDLINE Articles The National Library of Medicine (NLM) provides an abundance of metadata about each article indexed in MEDLINE. In this work, we indexed a total of eight fields of metadata:</p><p>• Indexing AACR/ASCO Proceedings Because AACR/ASCO Proceedings were only available in a simple text format, we were only able to index a subset of the fields indexed for MEDLINE articles:</p><p>• Article ID: the filename of the abstract as provided by the organizers, used as the document ID for TREC PM submissions; • Journal Title: the name of the conference; • Publication Date: the year of the conference; • Article Title: the title of the article; and • Abstract Text: the unstructured text of the article; 3.2.2 Indexing for Task B Task B relied on an index of clinical trials registered in Clini-calTrials.gov. While an abundance of metadata is available for each clinical trial, much of the metadata is represented as un-normalized free text, including date expressions, investigator names, descriptions of patient eligibility, etc. Producing the Clinical Trial index, consequently, entails two steps: (1) pre-processing each clinical trial, and (2) indexing each clinical trial.</p><p>Pre-processing Clinical Trials We observed three main inconsistencies in the metadata associated with each clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov:</p><p>1. Processing Investigator Names. Although the registry includes separate fields for the first, middle, and last name of each investigator, many investigators were provided with no first name, no middle name, and their entire name as the last name. If an investigator had no provided first name, we relied on a series of rules to try to recover the first and last names of investigator from the provided names. 2. Normalizing Temporal Expressions. We found that minimum/maximum eligibility age was expressed in a variety of ways, e.g., by years, months, weeks, or even days. Moreover, the start date was provided in a variety of inconsistent formats. To account for this, we normalized temporal expressions using Natty 1 . 3. Recognizing Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. The structured data associated with each clinical trial includes a single unstructured field containing all eligibility criteria. To distinguish between inclusion and exclusion criteria, we used a simple rule-based strategy for distinguishing between sections of the eligibility criteria field that describe inclusion and exclusion criteria. Moreover, to account for the role of negation, we applied negation span detection using LingScope <ref type="bibr" coords="4,278.01,380.27,13.18,8.85" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. By detecting negation spans, we were able to parse negated inclusion criteria as exclusion criteria and negated exclusion criteria as inclusion criteria.</p><p>Indexing Clinical Trials When indexing clinical trials, we considered a tiered index encoding multiple fields of metadata:</p><p>• NCT ID: The unique identifier associated with each clinical trial in ClinicalTrials.gov, used as the document ID for TREC PM submissions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topic Analysis</head><p>Because the topics evaluated in the 2017 TREC PM task correspond to complex semi-structured medical cases, determining the relevance of a document (i.e. scientific article or clinical trial) to a topic requires accounting for many different aspects. In this, we consider a total of six aspects of the topic: four corresponding to the four semi-structured fields of the topic, and two additional implied or "hidden" aspects.</p><p>The four explicit aspects are represented as follows:</p><p>1. Disease Aspect: The disease (a type of cancer) is represented as a 2-tuple (pair) containing (1) the literal/surface form of the disease included in the topic, and (2) the set of zero or more concept unique identifiers (CUIs) in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,376.14,468.03,11.84,8.85" target="#b2">[3]</ref> corresponding to the disease. To identify the concepts in UMLS corresponding to each disease, we used a simple pattern-matching approach relying on the surface form of the disease and any matching atoms in UMLS; 2. Genetic Aspect: Because a topic may indicate more than one genetic variant, we represent each genetic variant as a 3-tuple consisting of (1) the name of the gene, (2) the type of mutation, and (3) the locus of the mutation (if provided). The mutation type was determined using a small number of lexical patterns; the set of mutation types considered by our approach are: (1) amplification, (2) duplication, (3) translocation, (4) deletion, (5) point-mutation, (6) inactivation, and (7) unspecified; 3. Demographic Aspect: The demographic aspect of the topic was represented as a 2-tuple corresponding to two facets of demographic information, the patients age, and the patients gender; and 4. Other Aspect: The "other" aspect contains the set of medical problems (i.e., diseases, disorders, syndromes) provided by the TREC organizers for each topic. These typically include diseases which may affect the eligibility of a patient in a trial, or the efficacy of certain targeted treatments.</p><p>To account for the requirement that retrieved documents have a focus on targeted treatment and precision medicine, we considered to additional "hidden" aspects of each topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Precision Medicine Aspect:</head><p>This aspect indicates that retrieved documents must fall within the domain of precision medicine to be considered relevant; and 6. Treatment Aspect: This aspect indicates that retrieved documents must have a focus on treatment, and cannot be simple observational studies. To represent this aspect, we relied on the information encoded in the PMDG. Specifically, the treatment aspect is represented as a 2-tuple including (1) drugs targeting any gene/mutation in the topic, (2) any drugs that any gene/mutation in the topic confers resistance against.</p><p>Together, these six aspects are used to represent the diverse information needs expressed by each topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Topic Expansion</head><p>To account for the complexity of medical language in scientific articles and clinical trials, we incorporate query expansion techniques to expand (1) the medical problems within the disease and other aspects of the topic, (2) each genetic variant, and (3) any drugs in the treatment aspect of the topic.</p><p>Expanding the Disease and Other Aspects. To account for the role of synonymy in scientific articles and clinical trials, we incorporate two forms of query expansion: (a) we identify synonyms for each medical problem using UMLS and (2) we discover hyponyms using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,231.69,514.21,12.54,8.85" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Expanding the Genetic Variations. Because genetic information can be described in a variety of ways, we expand each gene itself so as to include gene synonyms using the Precision Medicine Drug Graph (PMDG). We expand the mutation type to include basic synonyms. Finally, we expand the locus of each mutation by (1) expanding the amino acids to their three-letter abbreviations and (2) adding the protein identifier "p." commonly used to indicate mutation loci in the literature.</p><p>Expanding Drugs. We expand drugs to include both brand names as well as generic names by using the PMDG. Specifically, we follow all synonym relations originating from the nodes corresponding to any drug in the treatment aspect, and use those nodes as synonyms for the drug.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Document Retrieval</head><p>The role of the document retrieval step is to produce a ranked list of documents -scientific articles or clinical trials -relevant to a given topic. We considered two strategies for document retrieval:</p><p>• Aspect Retrieval: to prevent any single aspect from having too large of an impact on the score of a document, in the aspect retrieval strategy, we cast each aspect of the topic as a separate, independent query and obtain a separate ranked list of documents for each aspect; and • Joint Retrieval: in the joint retrieval strategy, we cast each aspect of the topic as a clause in a single disjunctive Boolean query, obtaining a single ranked list of documents for the entire topic. Both strategies rely on Apache Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="5,481.02,260.37,3.38,6.46" target="#foot_0">2</ref> (version 6.6.0). It should be noted that the way in which each aspect was represented as a query (or clause) depends on whether the system is configured for Task A (scientific articles) or Task B (clinical trials).  <ref type="table" coords="5,344.41,512.49,3.78,4.62">2</ref>. Lexicon of drug roles targeting each type of genetic mutation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Retrieving Scientific Articles (Task A)</head><p>When retrieving scientific articles for a given topic, we encoded the disease aspect as an additive disjunctive Boolean query with a clause representing the surface form of the disease as indicated in the topic as well as additional clauses representing each expansion. By contrast, the genetic aspect was represented as special type of disjunctive Boolean query in which the score of a document was determined as the maximum score obtained for any clause in the query (rather than the total). When encoding the genetic aspect, we considered up to three clauses corresponding to (1) the gene and its expansions, (2) the type of mutation and its expansions, and (3) the locus (if provided) and its expansions (if any). To ensure that scientific articles satisfy the treatment aspect of the topic, we produced an additive disjunctive Boolean query in containing clauses encoding (a) the lexicon indicated in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,132.13,135.22,3.48,8.85" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, (b) the patterns indicated in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,288.18,135.22,3.48,8.85">2</ref>, (c) any drugs targeting the specific mutation and type of tumor indicated by the topic, and (d) any drugs known to be ineffective for the specific mutation. Finally, we address the precision medicine aspect by reducing the score of articles that focus on science rather than medicine and increasing the score of articles that appear that relate to clinical trials and studies involving humans. Specifically, we penalize the score of articles which (1) contain cell, biochem, chem, molecular, cytogenetics, pathology, or ⋆pathology in the title of the journal, (2) mention the terms cell, cell line, or cell cycle in the abstract or title of the article, and (3) have a MeSH term of "Cell Line, Tumor". To favor articles reporting the results of clinical studies, we increase the score of articles that have a MeSH term of "Human", or include any of the patterns indicated in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,166.02,314.55,3.45,8.85">3</ref>. We observed that, in general, scientific articles do not refer to the demographics or comorbidities of patients (an exception to this would be in the case of tumors occurring only in men or women-such as prostate or cervical cancer). Consequently, when searching scientific articles, we chose to ignore the demographic and other aspects of the topic. phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 phase I, phase II, phase III trial, randomized, patient Table <ref type="table" coords="6,96.02,455.79,3.78,4.62">3</ref>. Lexicon of words indicating medical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Retrieving Clinical Trials (Task B)</head><p>We observed that clinical trials often focused on general diseases rather than specific types of cancer. For example, when manually browsing ClinicalTrials.gov, we found that many clinical trials study any type of "solid tumor" rather than the specific type(s) provided in the topics evaluated in the Precision Medicine track. Consequently, when retrieving clinical trials for a given topic, we encoded the disease aspect as a disjunctive Boolean query with clauses representing (1) the surface form of the disease as indicated in the topic, (2) each expansion of the disease, as well as the phrases (3) "solid tumor" and (4) "solid neoplasm". When searching clinical trials, the genetic and treatment aspects were represented in the same way as when searching scientific articles. The demographic aspect was represented as a conjunctive Boolean query with three clauses ensuring (1) the minimum eligible age for the trial was &lt;= the age of the patient in the topic, (2) the maximum eligible age for the trial was &gt;= the age of the patient in the topic, and (3) the gender of the patient in the topic matched the eligible genders of the trial. To encode the other aspect of the topic, we constructed a disjunctive Boolean query containing each disease and its expansions, and penalized the score of clinical trials which matched this query in their Exclusion Criteria field, and slightly increased the score of clinical trials which matched this query in their Inclusion Criteria field. Finally, the precision medicine aspect was encoded as a disjunctive Boolean query favoring clinical trials which have at least one intervention of type "DRUG" or "GENETIC", and/or which include the term "Phase" in their Brief Title field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Aspect Fusion</head><p>When documents are retrieved using the Aspect Retrieval strategy, it is necessary to combine the ranked list of documents obtained for each aspect to produce a single ranked list of documents relevant to the topic. This is accomplished using a technique known as rank fusion or answer fusion. Rank fusion is a process for combining the ranked list resulting from multiple searches to produce a single ranked list of results. While a number of different methods for rank fusion have been published, they predominantly rely on combining the different relevance scores associated with the same document in different ranked lists. In our system, the scores produced when searching for each aspect can vary by several orders of magnitude, making score-based rank fusion techniques difficult to apply. Thus, we rely on a method known as Reciprocal Rank Fusion <ref type="bibr" coords="6,420.68,410.91,12.59,8.83" target="#b4">[5]</ref> (RRF). Rather than combining the different scores associated with a single document, RRF combines the reciprocal rank of the document in each ranked list. Formally, given a set of D documents to be ranked, and a set of rankings R, we determine the new score of each document d ∈ D as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,372.14,483.58,185.86,26.43">RRF-Score(d ∈ D) = r ∈R 1 k + r (d)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where r (d) is the rank of document d in ranking r , and k is a parameter intended to reduce the impact of low ranks on the score (in our experiments, we used k = 60 as recommended by the original authors). Thus, the role of the aspect fusion step is to combine the ranked list of documents obtained for each aspect of the topic using Equation <ref type="formula" coords="6,475.86,576.51,4.54,8.85" target="#formula_0">1</ref>to produce a single ranked list of documents for the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Similarity Fusion</head><p>It has been widely shown that for many machine learning evaluations, the top performing systems often combine a large variety of models. We were interested in learning whether this behavior was true for information retrieval problems as well. Thus, the role of the similarity fusion step entailed two steps: (1) the document retrieval process was repeated using a number of different similarity measures (or relevance models), and (2) the resultant ranked lists of </p></div>

For Task A, we report the inferred NDCG (infNDCG), Precision at 10 (P@10), and R-Precision (R-Prec).</p><p>For Task B, we report the Mean Average Precision (MAP), Precision at 5 (P@5), Precision at 10 (P@10), and Precision at 15 (P@15). In general, the best performance was obtained by Runs 2 and 3 which both incorporated Aspect Retrieval and Aspect Fusion. For Task A, Run 3 obtained slightly higher performance than Run 2 according to two metrics, suggesting that Similarity Fusion improved the quality of scientific articles retrieved by the system. By contrast, for Task B, Run 2 obtained slightly higher performance than Run 3 suggesting that considering multiple similarity measures provided no advantage to the system when ranking clinical trials. In addition to average results, we present the inferred NDCG and Precision at 5 scores obtained by each run as well as the maximum and median scores obtained by any run submitted by any team for each topic. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,498.20,322.43,9.00,8.85" target="#fig_6">4a</ref> presents the inferred NDCG scores for Task A, while Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,511.78,334.39,9.58,8.85" target="#fig_6">4b</ref> presents the Precision at 5 scores for Task B. It can be seen that performance of each run varies significantly between topics. For example, our simple baseline run, UTDHLTSQ, obtains the highest performance for Topic 7 in Task A, despite performing poorly over-all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we described our system designed for the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track. For both tasks, We submitted five runs corresponding to alternative configurations of our system. Our system incorporates an aspect-based retrieval paradigm wherein each of the four structured components is considered as an aspect, along with two "hidden" aspects encoding the need for retrieved documents to be within the domain of precision medicine and to have a focus on treatment. To this end, we construct knowledge graph encoding the relationship between genes, mutations, and drugs. Our experiments reveal that the aspect-based approach leads to improved quality of retrieved scientific articles and clinical trials.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,423.35,223.77,29.26,4.16;1,346.02,236.55,87.44,7.96;1,346.02,247.51,166.11,7.96;1,346.02,258.47,135.70,7.96;1,346.02,269.43,183.92,7.96"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Breast cancerGene(s): FGFR1 Amplification, PTEN (Q171) Demographics: 67-year-old female Other: Depression, Hypertension, Heart Disease</figDesc></figure>
