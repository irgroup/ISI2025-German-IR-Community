<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat are some of the massive sources of real-time information. Twitter, a popular microblogging website, which has massive user-generated content due to its large number of registered users. This year TREC 2017 has offered Real-Time Summarization (RTS) track with following objectives: (i) how fast the participating system can deliver relevant and novel tweets based upon the interest profile to mobile assessor via RTS broker through push notification. (ii) How we can generate the day-wise summary of tweet for given interest profiles.</p><p>Twitter allowed its registered user to post up to 140-character short message called tweet. Because of this, it becomes challenging for the participating system to calculate its relevancy against the interest profile. In the rest of paper, we will use tweet and post interchangeably. The organizer of TREC 2017 RTS <ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.18,284.01,11.61,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref> gave 188 interest profiles having topic-id, title, narrative and description.</p><p>The two scenarios were: Scenario A <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.32,320.97,10.89,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: Push notifications: Participating system continuously listens to the Twitter sample stream using Twitter Streaming API <ref type="bibr" coords="2,463.54,333.21,10.66,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The Twitter streaming API offers an approximately 1% sample of all tweets and is freely available to all registered users. As soon as the system identifies a relevant post against the required profile, it is immediately pushed to broker via a push notification. Push notifications should be relevant, timely and novel. Scenario B <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.52,382.05,12.74,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: Email digest. Alternatively, a user might want to receive a daily email digest that summarizes what happened that day with respect to the interest profiles. At a high level, these results should be relevant and novel; timeliness is not particularly important, provided that the tweets were all posted on the previous day.</p><p>For Scenario A, we pre-processed interest profile, removed all the stop words, and considered only noun, proper noun, and verb using Stanford POS tagger. In the next step, live tweets were collected, pre-processed and cleaned. Then we applied Okapi BM25 to get relevance score between tweets and each expanded interest profile. The threshold for interest profiles were estimated TREC RTS 2016 dataset. To ensure novelty we applied Jaccard similarity between the tweets which were already pushed and current candidate tweet Scenario B, e-mail digest, the submission was after scenario A in which we had to send a maximum of 100 tweets for each profile each day. At the end of a day, tweets were sorted in descending order of BM25, language model with JM smoothing and dirichlet smoothing ranking function score for each interest profile. All the tweets above the threshold were selected and saved according to the template given by TREC 2017. Again threshold was estimated using TREC 2016 dataset.</p><p>The rest of paper is organized as follows: In section2 we discuss related work, In section 3 we define the problem statement for scenario A and B. In Section 4 we discussed the methodology for scenario A. In section 5 we describe the methodology for scenario B. In section 6 we discussed the result and performance evaluation metric. In section 7 we conclude the discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>We started our work by referring TREC MICROBLOG 2015 papers.</p><p>CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.11,172.86,14.26,8.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has trained their Word2vec model using 4 years tweet corpus. They used Okapi BM25 relevance model to calculate the score. To refine the scores of the relevant tweets, tweets were rescored using the SVM rank package using the relevance score of the previous stage. Then Novelty Detection is done, where the tweets which are not useful are discarded, this is done using Jaccard similarity. University of Waterloo <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.53,245.49,13.36,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref> implemented the filtering tasks, by building a term vector for each user profile and assigning different weights to different types of terms. To discover the most significant tokens in each user profile, they calculated pointwise KL divergence and ranked the scores for each token in the profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROBLEM STATEMENT</head><p>Scenario A was mainly real time filtering task. Given an interest profile Q={Q1,Q2,..Qn}, and stream of tweets T={t1,t2,..tn} from public sample stream we need to compute the relevance score between tweets and profile R score=f(Q,T). Tweets having R score greater than threshold with respect to profile moved in the set PT= {pt1,pt2,...ptn}. At most, 10 novel tweets can be pushed to RTS broker per profile per day.</p><p>In the Scenario B, summary s={s1,s2,...,sn} has to be formed from relevant tweet RT={rt1,rt2...rtn} where rt i represents relevant tweet for a particular profile. A batch of top 100 ranked tweets per day per interest profile with any two tweets having a similarity of less than threshold sim(t1,t2) &lt; Ts is used for Email Digest. All tweets from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 were eligible candidates for a particular day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHODOLOGY FOR SCENARIO A:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1</head><p>Interest Profile Pre-processing TREC RTS 2017 has given 188 interest profiles. We converted these profiles into query by removing stop words and considering nouns, proper nouns and verbs using Stanford POS tagger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Profile (Query) expansion</head><p>We have downloaded profile specific tweet and extract top Named entity and hashtags for the each profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Profile Normalization</head><p>Interest profiles are consisting of title, sentence long description and paragraph long narrative. Title and description were merged so as to make interest profiles more informative. To increase the relevance, interest profiles were also pre-processed by converting all alphabets to small case and expanding the abbreviations. Also, interest profiles were stemmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Tweet Pre-processing</head><p>After gathering tweets, non-English tweets were filtered out. Tweet includes smileys, hashtags, and many special characters. did not consider retweets and tweet with only hashtag or emoticon or special characters. We also ignored the tweet with less than 5 words and removed all the stopwords from the tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Relevance Score</head><p>To calculate relevance score between tweets and interest profiles, we set weight as 2 for the original term in the interest profile and 1 for the terms added after training the profile. We have used BM25 model for calculating relevance score between expanded interest profile and query.Score is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,240.53,384.33,127.06,38.49">R_score = BM25 Sim(Q exp,T)] R_score = αT+βU+λE</formula><p>We have estimated α, β, λ using TREC 2016 Qrels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Novelty detection</head><p>For novelty detection, Jaccard Similarity was used. Temporal feature is used to select most informative tweet from the cluster</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,240.65,527.88,130.16,9.96">J(A,B) = (A ∩ B)/(A ∪ B) + F(T)</formula><p>where A and B are pushed and current tweets respectively. The highest ranked tweet for each profile was sent to TREC for assessment. Now for next eligible tweet, we calculated it's similarity with already sent tweet(s) so as to ensure novelty between them. Again a Jaccard threshold was decided and tweets below it were sent. Lower the similarity score, greater is the dissimilarity ensuring more novelty. Also, there were interest profiles where no relevant tweets for some day were found, which were known as SILENT DAYS. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">METHODOLOGY FOR SCENARIO B:</head><p>In this scenario, we had to make a summary up to top 100 relevant tweets for each interest profile. We have submitted 3 runs using ranking function like language model with JM smoothing, dirichlet smoothing Okapi BM25 ranking function to calculate relevance score. We have set 2 thresholds for the experiments. Ts-silent day threshold and relevance threshold Tr Again, these threshold were estimated using TREC 2016 datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">RESULTS</head><p>The evaluation of TREC 2017 Microblog track lasted 10 days, It consisted of 188 interest profiles. During the evaluation time, participants listened to the tweet stream continuously and analyzed with every tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Scenario A: User in the loop assessments</head><p>This live evaluation approach was started in TREC 2017 and promises a number of significant advantages over traditional post hoc batch evaluations because it is able to capture live user assessments. In this method, tweets submitted by participating systems to the RTS evaluation broker are immediately routed to an assessor, where it is rendered as a push notification containing the text of the tweet and the corresponding interest profile. The assessor may choose to judge the tweet immediately, or if it arrives at an inappropriate time, to ignore it. Either way, the tweet is added to a judging queue in a custom app on the assessor's mobile phone, which the assessor can access at any time to judge the queue of accumulated tweets.</p><p>As the assessor judges tweets, the results are relayed back to the evaluation broker and recorded. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have calculated relevance score between a tweet and expanded interest profile using BM25 Ranking function and customize ranking function. Novelty detection has been done using Jaccard similarity and temporal feature between previous pushed tweet and tweet to be pushed. We achieved average EG-p = 0.2065.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,256.13,265.89,84.37,8.96;5,133.00,124.80,418.80,138.70"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Scenario-A</figDesc><graphic coords="5,133.00,124.80,418.80,138.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
