<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">PageRank and Weighted PageRank</head><p>PageRank is a way to rank Web pages taking into account hyper-link structure of the Web <ref type="bibr" coords="1,151.61,637.18,11.71,10.48" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The easiest way to imagine the "physical" meaning of PageRank is to consider random surfer model, or a surfer who explores the Web in a random way. The surfer having found herself at a page jumps with some probability to an arbitrary page on the Web choosing the page uniformly from the set of all pages on the Web or with complementary probability follows one of hyper-links of the page choosing the outgoing link uniformly from the set of all the outgoing hyper-links of the page. The random surfer model forms ergodic Markov chain having a unique stationary probability distribution. An entry of the stationary distribution corresponding to a Web page can be interpreted as probability to find the surfer at the page and, hence, can be considered as a kind of popularity or authority measure of the page. PageRank provides nice and simple method to find out ranking of Web pages exploiting hyper-link structure of the Web but it produces just an approximation of the ranking since the random surfer model uses uniform distributions for all situation of choice happening during surf process implying that the random surfer has no preferences. The assumption is limited by its nature. Personalized PageRank was called upon to solve the problem but it is still quite restricted since assumes preferring behaviour just at jumping arbitrary page on the Web and non-preferring behaviour during regular following outgoing hyper-links. Taking into account these limits and restrictions of PageRank and Personalized PageRank we propose Weighted PageRank where we are free to weight hyperlinks according any possible preferring behaviour of an user. The most general definition of Weighted PageRank we can imagine is the following. Let us denote by n the number of pages on the Web. Let P = {1, 2, . . . , n} be the set of all the Web pages. We use subscripts i, j for enumeration over the set of all the Web pages. Let assume that we have infinite but countable number of types of links. We denote the set of link types as T , where T = N actually. We choose weights for each link type and denote them by {α k } ∞ k=1 . We use subscript k to enumerate link types. Link type weights meet the following conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,119.32,433.07,367.12,11.51">α k 0, ∀k ∈ T,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,119.32,447.20,367.12,32.12">∞ k=1 α k = 1.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Let us denote by P i the set of the outgoing links from page i, i ∈ P. It is evident that P i ⊂ P. Let us denote by n i the number of the outgoing link from page i, |P i | = n i . Let us denote by P k i the set of the outgoing links from page i of type k ∈ T . We note that a link can be polytypic and belong to several P k i . We assume here that a link is at least monotypic. We note that ∞ k=1 P k i = P i , and the most of P k i are empty. Let us denote by n k i the number of the outgoing link from page i of type k ∈ T ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,331.18,592.48,52.04,14.28">|P k i | = n k i .</formula><p>Let us define a map t i (j) of outgoing links of page i to their types.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,91.93,635.14,248.28,42.53">t i (j) : P i → 2 T \{∅}. t i (j)</formula><p>is a list of types of link (i, j). Let us denote by T i the set of link types which outgoing links of page i have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="2,249.91,709.41,78.55,12.33">T i = ∪ j∈P i t i (j).</formula><p>We note that k∈T i n k i n i . Now that we have defined a number of auxiliary notion, let us define weighted matrix W which plays for Weighted PageRank the same role as Google matrix for PageRank.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,115.34,188.16,371.11,31.25">w ij = m∈t i (j) α m n m i + 1 n i k ∈T i α k , j ∈ P i ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="3,115.34,224.14,86.60,11.50">w ij = 0, j ∈ P i .</formula><p>A link of a page receives a weight proportional to the weight of its link type with a portion of weights of link types which are not presented at the page.</p><p>Let us define one more notion: a set of links marked by their types.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="3,189.89,364.45,296.55,11.50">M i = {(j, m i (j))|j ∈ P i , m i (j) ∈ t i (j)}.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Proposition 1 If an original graph is strongly connected, which corresponds to ergodic Markov chain, then W is a stochastic matrix.</p><p>Proof We shall proof that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="3,234.85,483.04,108.68,31.85">n j=1 w ij = 1, ∀i ∈ P.</formula><p>Since the original graph is strongly connected there are not dangling pages.</p><p>Let us proof the statement for non-dangling page i,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="3,220.07,590.47,266.38,84.84">P i = ∅. n j=1 w ij = j∈P i w ij + j ∈P i w ij .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The second term is zero. Let us analyze the first term.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="4,182.09,101.01,304.36,160.81">j∈P i w ij = j∈P i   m∈t i (j) α m n m i + 1 n i k ∈T i α k   = (6a) = j∈P i m∈t i (j) α m n m i + k ∈T i α k = (6b) = (j,m)∈M i α m n m i + k ∈T i α k = (6c) = m∈T i j∈P m i α m n m i + k ∈T i α k = (6d) = m∈T i α m + k ∈T i α k = 1 (6e)</formula><p>We substitute definition of weight matrix entry in (6a). We open brackets and sum the second term in (6b). Double summation is equivalent to summation over M i set (6c). Now we can account elements of M i by their type (6d). Summation all the terms in (6e) applying (2) finishes the proof. 2</p><p>Weighted PageRank in its general definition can produce almost any ranking of the Web pages and actually possess too high liberty, therefore, it would be useful to consider special instantiations of Weighted PageRank with particular choice of link type weights.</p><p>Example 1 PageRank is a particular case of Weighted PageRank.</p><p>We have a graph. Let us assume that we have two types of links. Let us assume that all the links of the graph are of the first type and of the second type. Let us consider the complement the of graph to a fully connected graph. The links belonging to the complement we assume to be of the second type. Denote the weight of the first type by c, and the weight of the second type by (1 -c).</p><p>Then transition matrix written according to definition is the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11" coords="4,115.34,586.59,247.12,90.19">w ij = c n 1 i + c n 2 i , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 1 i , j ∈ P 2 i , w ij = 1 -c n 2 i , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 2 i , w ij = 1 -c n 2 i + c n i , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 2 i .</formula><p>After some simplification one can get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12" coords="5,115.34,68.98,245.77,87.27">w ij = c n 1 i + c n i , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 1 i , j ∈ P 2 i , w ij = 1 -c n i , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 2 i , w ij = 1 n , P 1 i = ∅, P 2 i = ∅, j ∈ P 2 i .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Weights according to a clustering</head><p>Let assume that we have a clustering C of all the pages on the Web. It does not matter how we get the clustering.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13" coords="5,119.32,300.33,165.69,45.96">C = {C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C N }, ∪ N i=1 C i = P, C i ∩ C j = ∅, i = j, i, j = 1, N .</formula><p>Having the clustering we can select two types of links: links lying inside clusters, e.g. links between pages belonging to same cluster, such links are also called intra-links, and links crossing cluster borders, e.g. links between pages belonging to different clusters, such links are also called inter-links. Let α k be weights for these two types of links:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14" coords="5,119.32,485.28,93.55,27.45">α k &gt; 0, k = 1, 2, α 1 + α 2 = 1.</formula><p>Let us define subindeces in the following way: k, m = 1, 2, k = m.</p><p>The Weighted transition matrix can be simplified in this case:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15" coords="5,115.34,621.16,174.93,96.41">w ij = 1 n , P i = ∅, w ij = α k n k i , j ∈ P k i , P m i = ∅, w ij = α k n k i + α m n i , j ∈ P k i , P m i = ∅, w ij = 0, j ∈ P i .</formula></div>

We performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check if the distribution of AP measures for PageRank and Weighted PageRank (or NDCG measures for PageRank and Weighted PageRank) follow the same distribution (the null hypothesis) and got that we cannot reject the null hypothesis up to significance level equal to 0.9865 for AP measure (or 0.9293 for NDCG measure), which makes us to conclude that AP measure of Weighted PageRank is greater than AP measure for PageRank in majority of cases is an arbitrary result.
