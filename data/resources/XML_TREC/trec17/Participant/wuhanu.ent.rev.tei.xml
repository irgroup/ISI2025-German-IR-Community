<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, much attention has been focused on the task of expert search. A lot of effective models have been proposed, which all made use of the co-occurrence information around expert evidence. This intuition is proved to be quite effective.</p><p>The language modeling methods are widely used in expert search. In TREC 2005, Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,166.22,530.76,11.71,9.02" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Azzopardi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.95,530.76,11.71,9.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref> introduced two language modeling methods for the expert search task. These methods were later explained by Balog et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,427.76,542.28,11.68,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref> as candidate model (model 1) and document model (model 2). Fang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.43,553.74,11.68,9.02" target="#b3">[4]</ref> also proposed a similar framework, but they explicitly modeled on relevance and adopted the probability ranking principle to rank experts.</p><p>Further, some detailed problems were studied under the framework proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,458.96,588.24,10.63,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Petkova et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,183.74,599.76,11.71,9.02" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposed a method to consider the dependency between terms and candidates using proximity-based measures. Balog et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,354.94,611.28,11.67,9.02" target="#b5">[6]</ref> elaborated the estimation of candidate-document association. Serdyukov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.64,622.74,11.68,9.02" target="#b6">[7]</ref> explored relevance propagation in expert search. Balog et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,259.55,634.26,11.68,9.02" target="#b7">[8]</ref> considered non-local information available in the collection for expert search. For a thorough review, please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="1,392.26,645.78,11.71,9.02" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="1,423.31,645.78,15.32,9.02" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The language modeling methods have also been proved to be effective under environments other than the TREC collections. For example, Balog et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.92,668.76,16.65,9.02" target="#b10">[11]</ref> created the UvT collection, which involved web pages with multi-linguistic features from a uni-versity. Besides, Serdyukov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.80,149.76,16.69,9.02" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,344.46,149.76,16.64,9.02" target="#b12">[13]</ref> applied the language modeling method to the internet environment and testified its effectiveness using search engine results.</p><p>It is the third year that our group participated in the TREC expert search task. In TREC 2006, we adopted a window-based method for expert search <ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.51,195.72,15.35,9.02" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We firstly built pseudo-profiles for each expert using their co-occurrence information in the documents, and then searched for relevant profiles using text retrieval models. In TREC 2007, we adopted a simple ranking model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,329.67,230.22,15.32,9.02" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, in which an expert's score is the linear combination of scores for all the supporting documents. In addition, we had adopted several methods to filter out invalid supporting documents, which can effectively enhance precision <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.37,264.72,15.34,9.02" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>This year, we mainly focus on the ambiguity of expert evidence in expert search. In the collection, an expert can appear in several kinds of evidence. Some evidences are ambiguous and can denote more than one expert.</p><p>We only consider three main kinds of evidence here: 1. ev fn : full name, e.g. "Jiepu Jiang"; 2. ev abbr : abbreviated name, e.g. "J. Jiang", "Jiang"; 3. ev em : email address, e.g. "jiepu.jiang@gmail.com". Generally, ev em is often the most explicit form of evidence, while ev fn and ev abbr can be ambiguous. The ambiguity depends on the size of the collection. For example, ev fn is mostly explicit in an enterprise that involves a few thousand experts, but it can be highly ambiguous over the internet. ev abbr is often highly ambiguous, even only in an enterprise size collection.</p><p>Current models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.70,420.24,11.93,9.02" target="#b3">[4]</ref>[5] <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.55,420.24,11.93,9.02" target="#b5">[6]</ref>[10] consider the ambiguity by involving a combination of several kinds of evidence with different weights in estimating the candidate-document associations. But most experiments indicated that using ev abbr will result in a loss in performance.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on better use of the ambiguous expert evidence, i.e. ev abbr . In contrast to other models, our proposed model estimates p(e|q) separately by each kind of evidence that can denote e. Besides, we have also used an auxiliary method in our experiments, i.e. phrase detection in the query.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we will describe our methods; in section 3, we will explain our experiments and submitted runs; in the end, we will draw a conclusion and discuss some future challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Modeling Expert Evidence in Expert Search</head><p>In this section, we will mainly explain our model for expert search, which considers each kind of evidence separately. From a language modeling perspective, we can rank experts by p(e|q), the probability that the query q is generated by the expert e. Then, applying Bayes rules, p(e|q) can be transformed as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="2,234.51,646.50,3.62,9.02" target="#formula_1">1</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,255.18,664.50,90.57,23.91">( | ) ( ) ( | ) ( )</formula><p>p q e p e p e q p q</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,280.44,661.16,190.36,19.22"> <label>(1)</label></formula><p>In a specific ranking task, p(q) is constant for each e and can be ignored in ranking. Besides, we simply assume the same prior probability p(e) for each expert e here. As a result, we can rank experts by p(q|e).</p><p>We represent all possible kinds of evidence for e as a set EV e {ev i }, in which ev i can be any of ev fn , ev abbr , or ev em that can denote e. Further, the whole event space can be partitioned into several subsets for each ev i . By the total probability formula, we can transform p(q|e) as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,222.31,218.76,3.60,9.02" target="#formula_3">2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,228.72,238.14,145.07,19.55">( | ) ( | , ) ( | ) i e i i ev EV</formula><p>p q e p q ev e p ev e</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,254.04,231.92,216.76,24.58">   <label>(2)</label></formula><p>In Eq. (2), p(ev i |e) is the probability that e will appear in the form of ev i , which can be explained as a kind of expert-evidence association, and p(q|ev i ,e) is the probability that e will generate q when it appears in the form of ev i , which can be explained as the evidence-topic association.</p><p>In the rest of this section, we will further explain our estimatition for p(ev i |e) and p(q|ev i ,e). For simplification, we have adopted the following assumption here: Assumption 1: ev fn and ev em are explicit, and only ev abbr can be ambiguous.</p><p>In assumption 1, we mean to only consider the ambiguity of ev abbr . The ambiguity of ev fn is ignored here, since it is rare in an enterprise collection that two persons have the same full name.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Expert-Evidence Association</head><p>The association between expert and evidence is measured as p(ev i |e), the probability that e appears in the form of ev i . In our model, we estimate it using a maximum likelihood estimation as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,227.57,456.06,3.62,9.02" target="#formula_5">3</ref>): </p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,250.74,473.89,100.23,24.02">( , ) ( | ) ( , )</formula><p>In Eq. (3), tf(ev i ,e) is the frequency of ev i that denotes e in the whole collection, and Ev e is the set of all possible evidences that can denote e.</p><p>For tf(ev fn ,e) and tf(ev em ,e), we can easily count them as tf(ev fn ) and tf(ev em ), which are the frequency of ev fn and ev em in the whole collection, since they are assumed to explicitly denote e here (assumption 1). Now, the rest of the question is how to estimate tf(ev abbr ,e), which is the frequency of ev abbr that denotes e in the whole collection. The problem is that ev abbr may denote more than one expert and the disambiguation cannot be perfect. For this problem, we first adopt a rule that can disambiguate ev abbr with certainty in a part of the collection, and then use the distribution of ev abbr in the disambiguated part to infer its distribution in the whole collection.</p><p>First, though we cannot disambiguate ev abbr in all the documents of the collection, we can disambiguate ev abbr in the documents that contain a related expert's ev fn or ev em . For example, if "Jiepu Jiang" is mentioned in a document, we know that "J. Jiang" in the same document refers to "Jiepu Jiang". Similarly, if "Jay Jiang" is mentioned, we know that "J. Jiang" in the document is not "Jiepu Jiang". For a simplification, we do not consider the circumstance that both "Jiepu Jiang" and "Jay Jiang" appear in a document. Using this method, we can disambiguate ev abbr in a part of the collection. We represent ev abbr in the disambiguated part of collection as ev' abbr .</p><p>Then, we can transform tf(ev abbr ,e) as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,306.88,195.72,3.61,9.02" target="#formula_7">4</ref>): </p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="4,232.08,214.14,103.08,9.25">( , ) ( )<label>(</label></formula><p>In Eq.

( <ref type="formula" coords="4,168.31,333.60,3.55,9.02" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), ev' abbr refers to ev abbr that can be disambiguated, and p(e|ev' abbr ) is the proportion of ev abbr that denotes e in the disambiguated part of collection, which can be estimated as the right part of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,272.99,356.64,3.55,9.02" target="#formula_8">5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Evidence-Topic Association</head><p>The association between evidence and the topic, i.e. p(q|ev i ,e), is the probability that e will generate q when it appears in the form of ev i . In another perspective, it can also be explained as the probability that ev i will generate q when it denotes e. We adopt the latter explaination, since it can be easily associated with previous language modeling methods for expert search. p(q|ev fn ,e) and p(q|ev em ,e) can be estimated directly as p(q|ev fn ) and p(q|ev em ), since ev fn and ev em are assumed to be explicit (assumption 1). The estimation of p(q|ev fn ) and p(q|ev em ) is quite similar to previous models for expert search.</p><p>For ev abbr , we can also adopt the intuition in 2.1. First, we can disambiguate ev abbr in a part of the collection. Then, we can estimate p(q|ev abbr ,e) as Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="4,401.71,516.12,3.60,9.02" target="#formula_10">6</ref>): <ref type="bibr" coords="4,386.51,534.48,3.42,9.25">)</ref> abbr abbr abbr e p q ev e p q ev e p q ev     </p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="4,211.98,534.48,144.19,9.25">( | , ) ( | , )<label>( |</label></formula><p>In Eq.

For simplification, we use ev' abbr-e to represent ev abbr that denote e in the disambiguated part of collection.</p><p>Further, we can estimate the probability of query generation for each of ev fn , ev em , and ev' abbr-e by previous language modeling methods for expert search. In this paper, we only adopted a frequently cited method, i.e. model 2 in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,368.27,612.54,10.63,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, as in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Other Methods</head><p>Some auxiliary methods have been studied in expert search to enhance the effectiveness, e.g automatic detection of expert home page, using HTML structures, the link structure in the collection, etc. We have also tested for a auxiliary method for expert search. We adopted a method for automatic detecting phrases in the query. For two adjacent terms in the query, i.e. t i and t j , we adopt p(t i t j |t i ,t j ) to determine whether t i t j is a phrase, which is the probability of t i and t j are adjacent when both of them appear in the documents. Further, we adopt a threshold value for p(t i t j |t i ,t j ) to filter term pairs that are not closely connected. Our previous experiments indicated that this method is profitable in the TREC 2007 collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>We submitted four runs this year to testify our methods proposed in section 2. First, we submitted a group of runs to testify whether our method considering each expert evidence is profitable: WHU08BASE: it mostly adopted the model 2 in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.57,546.96,10.61,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. But we simplified p(d|c), the candidate-document association. We simply set p(d|c) to 1 if c appears in d, since our previous experiments indicated that this simplification can enhance effectiveness. We used a combination of both ev fn and ev em in this run. ev abbr is ignored since it reduced the effectiveness in our experiments. Phrase detection is used.</p><p>WHU08CAN: it adopted the model 2 in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,302.23,604.44,10.62,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and p(d|c) is estimated in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,443.38,604.44,3.54,9.02" target="#formula_11">9</ref>). We used a combination of both ev fn and ev em in this run. ev abbr is ignored since it reduced the effectiveness in our experiments. Phrase detection is used.</p><p>WHU08RFCAN: it adopted our proposed method to consider each kind of ev i . We used ev fn , ev em , and ev abbr in run. Phrase detection is used.</p><p>Table . 1 gives out an overview of the evaluation results for three runs. We can find out that our proposed method, i.e. WHU08RFCAN, outperformed WHU08CAN. Besides, we have also tested for the phrase detection method: WHU08NOPHR: it adopted the method in WHU08BASE, but it did not used the phrase detection.</p><p>However, our experiments indicated that this method did not achieve better results in TREC 2008, although our previous experiments in TREC 2007 queries showed it is profitable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we described our methods adopted in the TREC 2008 expert search task. First, we proposed an adaption to the language modeling method for expert search, which considers the probability of query generation separately using different kinds of expert evidence (full name, abbreviated name, and email). Our experiments indicated that this method can effectively make use of the ambiguous evidence in expert search (e.g. abbreviated name). Previous expert search models can be easily integrated into the method proposed here. Besides, we have adopted a phrase detection method in our experiments, but it failed to make better results.</p><p>In the future, we plan to further investigate on the proposed method that considered each kind of evidence. First, we only adopted the most frequently used method for the estimation of p(q|ev i ), which should be tested using more methods. Second, in Eq. (3), Eq. (4), Eq.
