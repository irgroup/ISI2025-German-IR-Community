<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the massification of the internet and mobile devices, such as smartphones, people have started to access news more frequently from digital sources than printed ones <ref type="bibr" coords="1,201.11,396.81,14.29,7.77" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.79,396.81,10.72,7.77" target="#b12">13]</ref>. This has meant that newspaper publishers have had to focus more on the digital experience and perform users' behavioral analysis for providing tools such as news recommendation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,182.96,429.68,13.64,7.77" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Furthermore, as Pranjić et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,64.68,440.64,14.88,7.77" target="#b26">[27]</ref> indicate, linking news to other relevant articles can improve businesses' websites metrics such as user engagement and average time on page. Subsequently, this can improve revenues from ads or sponsored articles.</p><p>Therefore, in 2018 the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) along with The Washington Post 1 , decided to propose the News Track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,278.15,495.60,13.61,7.77" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, a track where the goal is to enhance users' experience while reading news articles.</p><p>Since TREC 2020, the News Track is organized into two subtasks, Background Linking and Wikification. The former has been defined as the task where "given a news article, a system should retrieve other news articles that provide important context and/or background information that helps the reader better understand the query article" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.80,583.27,13.61,7.77" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The latter exploits, as a means of contextualization, the linking of textual elements, such as concepts and artifacts, to an external knowledge-base, in this case to Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,206.86,605.19,13.74,7.77" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present the participation of the L3i Laboratory of the University of La Rochelle at the 2021 TREC News Track Background Linking task. Our participation consisted of five different approaches that used, for instance, keyword extraction, entities, and events detection, but also sentence embeddings and linear combination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Before TREC 2018 News Track, there is a reduced number of works that explore the use of news articles as a way to contextualize elements such as comments <ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.11,297.05,9.52,7.77" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.20,297.05,13.74,7.77" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or events <ref type="bibr" coords="1,503.12,297.05,13.74,7.77" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Since the proposal of the News Track in TREC 2018, we have seen an increment of publications related to the contextualization of news articles using other news articles. Most of them are works explaining TREC participant systems <ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.76,340.89,14.09,7.77" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,468.08,340.89,11.16,7.77" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.49,340.89,10.57,7.77" target="#b23">24]</ref>. However, we can find as well some other related outputs and analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,504.99,351.85,14.19,7.77" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,521.42,351.85,10.65,7.77" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>More recently and besides TREC-related outputs, we can name the work of Pranjić et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,410.54,373.76,13.78,7.77" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, where the authors explore different models to link background and related news articles in a Croatian corpus. Furthermore, Koloski et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,443.37,395.68,14.94,7.77" target="#b18">[19]</ref> explore the linking of crossborder news articles in Latvian and Estonian. Also, we can name the MIND dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,383.90,417.60,13.69,7.77" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, a collection of news articles from Microsoft News that are associated with human behaviors, in order to explore news recommendation tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA</head><p>For 2021, the TREC News Track organizers provided a corpus composed of 728,626 news articles and blog posts published by The Washington Post from January 2012 through December 2020. Each document, either news article or blog post, includes elements such as title, kicker (section header), body, author, images captions, and publication date. Also, TREC organizers delivered a list of 51 different topics, i.e. news articles, for which TREC News Track's participants had to propose background articles. For the 2021 edition of TREC News Track, the organizers also added a subtopic task, in which specific information, such as the background, is expected for each topic. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,397.10,602.88,3.43,7.77" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we present the topic structure used in the 2021 TREC News Track.</p><p>We first performed a pre-processing that consisted of parsing each document element, such as titles and captions, in order to get sentences. This pre-processing was done using Turku Neural Parser <ref type="bibr" coords="1,317.96,657.67,13.74,7.77" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Once the documents were pre-processed, we decided to create embeddings for every document element using Sentence BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,542.31,679.59,13.61,7.77" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a fine-tuned BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,390.80,690.55,15.06,7.77" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which produces embeddings that can be compared using cosine similarity. Specifically, we made use of the &lt;top&gt; &lt;num&gt;Number: xxx &lt;/num&gt; &lt;docid&gt;f30b7db4-cc51-11e6-a747-d03044780a02&lt;/docid&gt; &lt;url&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ homicides-remain-steady-in-the-washington-region/ 2016/12/31/ f30b7db4-cc51-11e6-a747-d03044780a02_story.html&lt;/url&gt; &lt;title&gt;Topic title&lt;/title&gt; &lt;desc&gt;I would like to learn more about this topic&lt;/desc&gt; &lt;narr&gt;Traditional TREC narrative paragraph on the topic&lt;/narr&gt; &lt;subtopics&gt; &lt;sub num="1"&gt;This is the first subtopic.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub num="2"&gt;And this is the second one.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/subtopics&gt; &lt;/top&gt; pre-trained model stsb-mpnet-base-v2<ref type="foot" coords="2,194.61,325.13,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_0">2</ref> which at the time of the experiments was the most performing model available.</p><p>Due to limitations on how many tokens can be processed by Sentence BERT, i.e. 128 byte-pair encoding tokens, and to avoid losing vital information, we calculated the embeddings sentence by sentence. To be precise, we requested from Sentence BERT model the dense representation of each token in every sentence. The final dense representation of a text portion was obtained by averaging the dense vector of every token.</p><p>It should be indicated as well that we created composite vectors, in which we calculated the average embeddings based on multiple document elements: Title-Lead, Title-Body, and Title-Body-Captions. We also processed, in the same way, each topic provided by the TREC organizers, which notably included the creation of dense vectors for the narration or for the subtopics.</p><p>For retrieving documents from the corpus, we indexed the preprocessed data using Open Distro for ElasticSearch<ref type="foot" coords="2,243.94,500.63,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_1">3</ref> (ODFE), an ElasticSearch<ref type="foot" coords="2,103.21,511.76,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_2">4</ref> branch which implements a performing k-NN algorithm that can be used to retrieve documents using dense vectors, such as embeddings. <ref type="foot" coords="2,127.76,533.84,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_3">5</ref>In total, we indexed 728,500 articles from The Washington Post, which corresponded to 99.98% of the articles provided by TREC organizers. The code for pre-processing and indexing the data is publicly available in GitHub <ref type="foot" coords="2,157.30,577.84,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_4">6</ref> . It should be noted, in the code, that the indexes contained more information than the one detailed in this work. However, not all the information was used for the creation of the submitted approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPLORED APPROACHES</head><p>In this section, we describe in detail the five approaches we explored to provide background links for each topic:</p><p>(1) KWVec: keywords and dense vectors to retrieve the related background articles; (2) Lambda: linear combination of multiple queries;</p><p>(3) 300K_ENT_PH: the articles retrieved by KWVec are reranked with the utilization of entities and event mentions; (4) 300K_ENT_PH_DN: the articles retrieved and re-ranked by 300K_ENT_PH are again sorted depending on the description and the narrative field; (5) Lambda_narr: the outcome produced by the Lambda approach is followed by re-ranking the recommended articles using the narrative field. Each of the following sections detail the five approaches used to provide subtopic background linking. These five approaches consist of re-rankings of the former approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Run 1: KWVec</head><p>This approach consists of using keywords and dense vectors to retrieve the related background articles for a determined topic.</p><p>Specifically, we start by extracting unigram keywords from the text produced by the concatenation of the title, body, and captions. <ref type="foot" coords="2,554.43,335.60,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_5">7</ref>This is done using YAKE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,414.29,348.71,9.65,7.77" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, an unsupervised keyword extractor. Once we have the unigram keywords, we obtain those related to the title by matching the title's unigrams and the obtained keywords.</p><p>The second step of KWVec consists of using a boosting query <ref type="foot" coords="2,552.92,379.60,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_6">8</ref> , where a collection of queries are used to retrieve the documents, and another set is used to decrease their relevance.</p><p>To retrieve the documents, we submit three different queries to ODFE. Two of them ask ODFE to retrieve the documents that are relevant to the keywords found by YAKE. To be precise, we search title keywords in titles and body keywords in bodies. These queries are done through a query string query <ref type="foot" coords="2,453.42,456.48,3.64,6.31" target="#foot_7">9</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, as YAKE assigns a weight 𝑤 to each keyword, we make use of these weights to increase or decrease the query string query relevance through the boost parameter. Nonetheless, as YAKE's weights interval is between (0, ∞), where the lower the score the better, we modify it with Equation 1 to an interval of (𝑖𝑛𝑓 , 0], where the higher the score the better.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,375.97,545.56,182.24,21.58">𝐾𝑊 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 = -𝑙𝑛(𝑤) if 𝑤 &lt; 1 0 otherwise<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The third query retrieves the most relevant documents using ODFE's exact k-NN and cosine similarity. <ref type="foot" coords="2,475.20,581.64,7.27,6.31" target="#foot_8">10</ref> Specifically, the cosine similarity is calculated between the title-body dense vectors of the topic article and those found in the index.</p><p>It should be indicated that we modified ODFE's cosine similarity (𝑠) score using Equation <ref type="formula" coords="2,408.97,627.63,3.43,7.77" target="#formula_1">2</ref>. The first reason is that ODFE's cosine similarity is vertically translated, within the interval [0, 2], to provide only positive scores. The second reason is to boost the cosine similarity by a scalar defined experimentally to 250 and prevent its fading with respect to the keywords scores.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,111.94,145.92,182.10,21.58">𝑆𝑖𝑚 = 250 × (𝑠 -1) 𝑖 𝑓 𝑠 ≥ 1 0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We requested ODFE to reduce by 20% the relevance of documents that are associated with an unwanted kicker 11 and/or whose title was similar to the topic's. The former aspect was to reduce the relevance of articles that are frequently not used by The Washington Post's journalists. The latter aspect was calculated using exact k-NN and cosine similarity between titles dense vectors. We do this to avoid articles that might be considered relevant because they are either a duplicate of the topic article 12 or whose title is too similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Run 2: Lambda</head><p>Besides the previously described approach, we decided to explore a linear combination (see Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,175.93,302.17,3.77,7.77" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) optimized through a Bayesian optimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,138.72,313.29,14.95,7.77" target="#b22">[23]</ref>  13 . Through this optimization, our goal was to determine the weights (𝜆) that different queries scores (𝑥), such as title similarity, should be given in order to achieve the highest nDCG evaluation. This approach is similar to the one used by Cabrera-Diego et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,128.86,357.13,10.45,7.77" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for merging different systems outputs.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,129.70,382.79,164.35,9.38">𝜆 1 𝑥 1 + 𝜆 2 𝑥 2 + . . . + 𝜆 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For the Lambda approach, we explored four different independent queries 14 , title to title, body to body, lead to title and lead to body, using two methods, keywords and dense vectors. This gave a total of eight different independent queries used for the optimization. The queries based on keywords use the method presented in Section 4.1, while queries based on dense vectors used an unmodified version of ODFE's exact k-NN and cosine similarity. Furthermore, for the Lambda approach, we removed from the recommended articles those with an unwanted kicker (see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,160.61,488.24,44.64,7.77">Footnote 11)</ref>.</p><p>To calculate the value of the different 𝜆, we used as training data the sets provided by the organizers from previous years plus some additional articles that we annotated ourselves. 15 Specifically, we requested ODFE to calculate 16 the relevance score of the eight queries for each document for which we had a gold standard score. Then, the Bayesian optimization proposed different 𝜆 weights, in the interval of [-10, 10], that optimized an objective function.</p><p>The objective function to be maximized by the Bayesian optimization is presented in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,157.90,587.20,3.34,7.77" target="#formula_3">4</ref>, where 𝐺 is a weighted harmonic average, 𝑄 1 and 𝑄 3 are respectively the first and third quartile, and 𝑄 2 11 Opinions, Opinion, Letters to the Editor, The Post's View, Global Opinions, All Opinions Are Local, Local Opinions 12 Although the organizers removed most of the duplicate articles, the process was not without faults. 13 https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization 14 This means that each query was done one by one. 15 We annotated five recommended articles per topic, about which we did not know anything. The recommended articles came from the title to title dense vector queries. 16 https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/ reference/7.12/search-explain.html is the median. These values are calculated based on the nDCG@10 scores obtained by each topic for all the years (2018-2020).<ref type="foot" coords="3,531.10,96.62,7.27,6.31" target="#foot_9">17</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,367.65,117.03,190.55,21.12">𝐺 = 5𝑄 1 𝑄 2 𝑄 3 (𝑄 2 𝑄 3 ) + (2.5𝑄 1 𝑄 3 ) + (1.5𝑄 1 𝑄 2 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The weighted harmonic average presented in Equation 4 was defined to boost the median (𝑄 2 ) nDCG@10 score, but also to create a negatively skewed distribution of the nDCG@10 scores, by boosting the third quantile (𝑄 3 ). This would mean that we expect most of the nDCG@10 scores to have higher values rather than lower ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Run 3: 300K_ENT_PH</head><p>This approach extends the KWVec method with a re-ranking step applied after the relevant documents were retrieved by the ODFE query. Thus, since named entity recognition (NER) has been playing an important role in information seeking and retrieval, we propose to exploit knowledge about entities and their relationships (events) for re-evaluating the relevance of the query results. For this and for taking advantage of the annotation efforts from previous campaigns, we leverage the fine-grained entities defined by the organizers of the TAC KBP Recognizing Ultra Fine-grained Entities (RUFES) 2020 <ref type="foot" coords="3,550.43,316.16,7.27,6.31" target="#foot_10">18</ref>and the events defined by the ACE 2005 evaluation campaign <ref type="foot" coords="3,538.18,327.17,7.27,6.31" target="#foot_11">19</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.1</head><p>Fine-grained Entities. The KBP 2020 RUFES dataset provided by the organizers consisted of the development source documents and evaluation source documents drawn from a collection of The Washington Post news articles. The development source corpus and the evaluation source corpus had approximately 100, 000 articles each, from which 50 documents were annotated for the development set with entity types from an ontology that contains approximately 200 fine-grained entity types and that followed the same three-level x.y.z hierarchy as in the TAC-KBP 2019 EDL track <ref type="bibr" coords="3,506.27,433.83,15.01,7.77" target="#b14">[15]</ref>  <ref type="foot" coords="3,521.27,431.67,7.27,6.31" target="#foot_12">20</ref> . For example, such an entity organized in a hierarchy is: Photographer is from an Artist that, in turn, is a subtype of PER 21 .</p><p>In order to benefit from the extraction of these entity types, we made use of our recently proposed model for coarse-grained and fine-grained named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.87,488.78,7.55,7.77" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,469.42,488.78,3.77,7.77" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,473.20,488.78,7.55,7.77" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,483.96,488.78,7.53,7.77" target="#b6">7]</ref> that consists in a hierarchical, multitask learning approach, with a fine-tuned encoder based on BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,380.52,510.70,13.87,7.77" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Events.</head><p>The annotated data of the ACE 2005 corpus provided by the ACE evaluation is restricted to a range of types, each with a set of subtypes. Thus, only the events of an appropriate type Events are distinguished from their mentions in text. An event mention or a trigger is a span of text (an extent, usually a sentence) with a distinguished trigger word and zero or more arguments, which are entity mentions, timestamps, or values in the extent. Since there is nothing inherent in the task that requires the two levels of type and subtype, we will refer to the combination of event type and subtype (e.g., Life.Die) as the event type. If we consider the example sentence "There was the free press in Qatar, Al Jazeera but its' offices in Kabul and Baghdad were bombed by Americans.", an event extractor should detect a Conflict.Attack event mention, with the trigger word bombed.</p><p>For detecting events, we focus on the event mention detection, and we use a BERT-based model with entity markers <ref type="bibr" coords="4,227.78,403.00,9.63,7.77" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,239.65,403.00,6.69,7.77" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,248.59,403.00,11.17,7.77" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,262.00,403.00,10.58,7.77" target="#b21">22]</ref>.

We can notice that for some topics, e.g. 957 or 979, it was very hard to predict a good background article for all the participants. In these cases, the median is not only very low, but the full distribution is quite compact and close to zero. This contrasts with other topics, like 946, 937 and 977, where despite having a low median, at least one of our approaches managed to reach values similar or equal to the maximum nDCG@5 score. Finally, we can observe that for some topics it was easy to predict background articles for most participants, such as topic 964 and 972.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="6,95.37,87.81,4.47,7.77" target="#tab_6">3</ref> we present a summary of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,219.97,87.81,3.36,7.77">2</ref>, where we indicate the number of nDCG@5 scores, produced by our runs for each topic, found within each nDCG@5 quartiles. It should be noted, that in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,75.50,120.69,3.37,7.77" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, if the value associated with a quartile was equal to another one, e.g. 𝑄 0 = 𝑄 1 , like in topic 946, the score was assigned to the quartile closest to the median one (𝑄 2 ).</p><p>Based on the results present in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,202.78,153.56,3.43,7.77" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, we can determine that the recommendations produced by our approaches generated an nDCG@5 greater than the participants' median in at least 60% of the topics. Specifically, KWVec 66.6%, Lambda 60.7%, 300K_ENT_PH 74.5%, 300K_ENT_PH_DN 64.7% and Lambda_narr 70.5%. Moreover, all our approaches achieved the maximum score nDCG@5 score in at least 9.8% of the topics, topped by 300K_ENT_PH_DN with a 21.5%.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,98.27,241.24,3.30,7.77">3</ref>, we present the distribution of nDCG@5 scores generated by each of our explored approaches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>One aspect that we noticed from KWVec during the experimentation with the 2020 topics is that the scores obtained by the cosine similarity were, in multiple cases, diminished by the scores obtained by keywords. In other words, the final score given by ODFE to a document came mostly from the keywords, and not from the cosine similarity calculations. This is why we added weight (250) to Equation 2. However, this number was chosen experimentally based on 2020 topics. Due to this, we decided to explore the Lambda approach, where we expected that the Bayesian optimization could automatically determine the weights (𝜆) that should be used to merge the scores to get the best nDCG scores. Nonetheless, the performance of Lambda did not surpass that of KWVec, even if similar queries were used along with more specific ones.</p><p>There are multiple possible reasons why the Lambda approach did not surpass KWVec's performance. In the first place, for training, we relied on data from previous years which were produced using different methods. This means that for training we used documents that on occasions would not be retrieved by our queries as highly relevant, and therefore we introduce a bias in the weights of certain queries. Sometimes the top retrieved documents by our queries had to be removed from the training as we did not know their gold standard relevance. In spite of the fact that we manually annotated some top retrieved documents, for which we did not have a gold standard relevance score, the additional scored documents seemed to be insufficient for the training. This last point can be because of the annotation quality and variety, as it focused on one type of query, the title-title similarity, and the process was done by just one person, who could naturally be biased.</p><p>With respect to Lambda_narr, although it did not surpass KWVec performance, we can determine from Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,481.59,285.07,3.43,7.77">3</ref>, that re-ranking the documents according to the narrative produced interesting results. We managed to set 50% of the nDCG@5 scores within a smaller and better range of values [0.310, 0.717] with respect to the other approaches. Nonetheless, most of the Lambda_narr scores were closer to 0.310 rather than to 0.717, creating a positively skewed distribution that affected its median. Despite this, Lambda_narr's median, 0.445, is similar to the one set by its parent, the Lambda approach, with an nDCG@5 of 0.446.</p><p>In regard to the re-rankings enhanced with entities and events or narratives, both runs, 300K_ENT_PH and 300K_PH_DN are rather homogeneous, with the same range of values [0.126, 0.714], and slightly similar median values. However, both 𝑄 1 and 𝑄 3 nDCG@5 scores surpass those of KWVec and Lambda.</p><p>It is interesting to observe that despite the fact that the model 300K_PH_DN achieved the largest number of topics with a maximum score, 11 as seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,428.65,460.41,3.30,7.77" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, its median did not surpass KWVec. It is possible that the 300K_PH_DN median was severely affected by the nDCG@5 scores of topics 982 and 962, which were zero, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,371.00,493.29,3.36,7.77">2</ref>.</p><p>In all the cases, the results obtained by 300K_ENT_PH and 300K_PH_DN, and especially the latter, could indicate that background linking could benefit from augmenting the articles with additional extracted information, such as named entities and events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we presented the participation of the Laboratory L3i, University of La Rochelle, at TREC 2021 News Track Background Linking. From our participation, we noticed that, despite the existence of embeddings from fine-tuned language models such as Sentence BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,378.67,624.80,13.88,7.77" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, keywords are still one of the most powerful sources of knowledge to rank news articles. Also, we observed that extracting additional textual elements, such as named entities and events, can be useful and, in some cases, they can provide unique information that will bring out the most relevant articles. Furthermore, re-ranking news articles based on simple inputs from journalists, like a summary of what it is expected to retrieve, can improve the performance of a news background linking system. Regarding training a Nonetheless, based on our results, it could be feasible, but more annotated data would be necessary to reduce bias. Finally, as future work, we would like to apply the previously explored background linking approaches in less-represented languages, such as Croatian and Finnish, through the Embeddia project <ref type="bibr" coords="7,270.96,258.37,13.74,7.77" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,53.80,283.13,240.24,8.06;2,53.80,294.09,182.42,8.06"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Structure of TREC News Track 2021 topics, where the description and subtopics fields were added.</figDesc></figure>
