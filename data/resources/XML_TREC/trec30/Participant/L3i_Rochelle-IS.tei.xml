<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper summarizes the participation of the L3i laboratory of the University of La Rochelle in the TREC Incident Streams 2021. This track aimed at identifying critical information present in social media by categorizing and prioritizing tweets in a disaster situation to assist emergency service operators. For both classifying tweets by information type and ranking tweets by criticality, we proposed a multitask and multilabel learning approach based on representing the tweet text and the event types with pre-trained language models, and by highlighting entities and hashtags. We also experimented with a bag of words representation and classical machine learning methods for the prioritization task. We conclude that, because our multitask approach can take advantage of both tasks, it achieved the best performance in comparison with different proposed ensembles. Our submissions obtained top performance for the prioritization task and surpassed the median performance for the information type classification task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods are often a surprise or have little warning, result in deaths, injuries, and destruction, and require swift action to protect people and property. These types of major events and issues are often shared and communicated on Twitter before many other online and offline platforms. TREC 1 Incident Streams campaign aims at producing a series of curated feeds containing social media posts (Twitter), where each feed corresponds to a particular type of information request, aid request, or report containing a particular type of information. The main purpose is creating tools for filtering media stream down to actionable information or to route that information to the appropriate stakeholder (e.g., public health officials, emergency response officers, etc.).</p><p>TREC-IS 2021 is the fourth year of promoting research to better support emergency response services' efforts to harness social media, making it an ideal space to investigate new tools and techniques. In this paper, we describe our approach for this edition. We explore methods based on the Transformer architecture and classical machine learning algorithms. Our main approach consists of a stack of Transformer layers with pre-trained and fine-tuned language models trained in a multitask manner to predict both information type and the prioritization level. Furthermore, we take advantage of the presence of entities, the event type, and the title of the tweet. We present relevant related work related to previous TREC Incident Stream editions in Section 2 and the description of the TREC Incident 2021 in Section 3. We detail our methods in Section 4 and the experimental setup along with several ablation studies are presented in Section 5. We draw conclusions about our findings in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>TREC-IS was initiated in 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,436.64,493.29,15.06,7.77" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and it developed test collections and evaluation methodologies for automatic or semi-automatic filtering approaches for the identification and the social media aidrequests categorization during crisis situations. Relevant crises for TREC-IS include six natural and man-made events: wildfires, earthquakes, floods, typhoons/hurricanes, bombings, and shootings. While the participants in this pilot edition were relatively effective at identifying common information types such as news reports and sentiment, identifying actionable information types like search and rescue requests proved to be still challenging. The participant systems were mostly based on bag of words representation (term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting) and classical machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,317.96,635.76,9.82,7.77" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,330.91,635.76,6.77,7.77" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.83,635.76,11.25,7.77" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,355.22,635.76,10.72,7.77" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Although they tended to over-estimate, they were more accurate at estimating information criticality.</p><p>TREC-IS 2019 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,384.81,657.67,15.01,7.77" target="#b21">[22]</ref> included two editions, 2019-A and 2019-B, two Twitter datasets with events retrospectively crawled by TREC-IS organizers (based on manually selected keywords), and modified performance metrics to differentiate between actionable information types and all types. Besides the classical bag-of-words or n-gram representation, this year's participants leveraged tweet text during categorization by converting text into a form of word or character sequence embedding (GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.32,109.73,13.75,7.77" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, FastText <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.53,109.73,9.54,7.77" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,251.15,109.73,13.76,7.77" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, ELMo <ref type="bibr" coords="2,53.80,120.69,13.59,7.77" target="#b29">[30]</ref>). The organizers reported that while deep learning methods were becoming more prevalent and effective, the traditional machine learning remained competitive, and thus, the majority using these approaches (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression or Random Forests) were the most effective systems in terms of identifying actionable content for both editions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,143.96,175.48,14.19,7.77" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.39,175.48,11.21,7.77" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.84,175.48,10.65,7.77" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>TREC-IS 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.43,186.44,10.58,7.77" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was separated in three tasks. High-Level information type classification was the task where tweet streams from a collection of crisis events should be classified as having one or more of the high-level information types described in an ontology provided by the organizers. The second included a restricted version of the first task that focused only on a subset of the high-level information types. This subset included the top six information types labeled as actionable in previous editions (i.e., the types that have, on average, the highest priority) as well as five other types selected from the full set used in the first task. While these two tasks continued the prior TREC-IS work on classifying information for wildfires, earthquakes, floods, typhoons/hurricanes, bombings, and shootings, TREC-IS 2020 proposed the third task to provide assistance to public health officials and emergency response officers with additional tools and evaluation data for future public health emergencies or resurgence of COVID-19. The organizers concluded that the additional complexity of a large information-type label space led to significant performance improvements compared to systems that are trained on a coarser label space <ref type="bibr" coords="2,129.98,383.70,9.71,7.77" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.93,383.70,10.65,7.77" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TREC-IS 2021</head><p>For standardized evaluations of systems, TREC-IS provided participants with training and test datasets, comprised of three components: the ontology of high-level information types, a collection of crisisevent descriptions, and the tweets for each event to be categorized. The participant TREC-IS systems are intended to produce two outputs for crisis-related social media content:</p><p>(1) Classifying tweets by information type, where each tweet should be assigned as many categories as are appropriate; (2) Ranking tweets by their criticality (priority). TREC-IS provided multiple Twitter datasets collected from a range of past wildfires, earthquakes, floods, typhoons/hurricanes, bombing, and shooting events. The metadata for each event is provided in an XML topic file as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,232.88,580.96,3.36,7.77" target="#fig_0">2</ref>.</p><p>The information types as either top-level intent, high-level or low-level. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,169.73,602.88,4.57,7.77">1</ref> is a post regarding an event that happened on 4 August 2020, when a large amount of ammonium nitrate was stored at the port of the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, accidentally exploded. This tweet has an information type of a top-level Donations that asks for a service to be provided. The tweet is of high priority with four information type categories: Donations, Location, ContextualInformation, Sentiment.</p><p>The provided training dataset consisted of a total of 73,499 tweets that covered 75 topics. We did not perform any pre-processing on the data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">MULTITASK INFORMATION TYPE AND PRIORITY TWEETS CLASSIFICATION</head><p>We propose a multitask and multilabel learning approach that consists in a hierarchical architecture with a fine-tuned RoBERTa-based encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.29,460.41,15.05,7.77" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and a stack of Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,467.72,460.41,15.06,7.77" target="#b32">[33]</ref> blocks on top of the encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.09,471.37,7.55,7.77" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.64,471.37,3.77,7.77" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.42,471.37,7.55,7.77" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,372.16,471.37,6.54,7.77" target="#b5">6]</ref>. The multitask prediction layer consists of two separate linear dense softmax layers as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,530.85,482.33,3.36,7.77" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>A Transformer is a deep learning architecture based on multihead attention mechanisms with sinusoidal position embeddings. In our implementation, we used learned absolute positional embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,340.53,526.17,15.06,7.77" target="#b12">[13]</ref> instead, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.41,526.17,13.87,7.77" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Both versions produced nearly identical results <ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.36,537.13,13.88,7.77" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It is composed of a stack of identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first layer is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, while the second one is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. A residual connection is around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We decided to add a stack of Transformer layers due to the assumption that additional hyperparameters can increase the ability of the architecture to better model long-range contexts and alleviate the number of spurious predicted entities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,480.74,624.80,9.57,7.77" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The output of the RoBERTa encoder consists of the final hidden state vector of [𝐶𝐿𝑆] as the representations of the whole sequence and the sequential token representation. We apply the stack of Transformer blocks on this sequence and the output is concatenated with the [CLS] representation which afterwards is fed into two output layers for classification: a sigmoid dense layer for information type classification (with a 0.5 cut-off) and a softmax dense layer for priority classification. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Marking Entities and Highlighting Hashtags</head><p>Different from previous approaches that primarily focused on the tweet text, we, additionally, took advantage of topic-related information (as in the topic example in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,192.63,379.17,3.24,7.77" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p><p>Hashtags. First, since hashtags are one of the main reasons for which Twitter trends emerge rapidly around the day's news, events that unexpectedly gain viral traction, we explore their representation. A hashtag is a combination of keywords or phrases preceded by the # symbol, excluding any spaces or punctuation. Thus, to exploit them, we separate the keywords with a simple rule that tokenizes at the encounter of an uppercase letter (e.g., #BloodDonation becomes # Blood Donation).</p><p>Entities. Second, given that any kind of information can be posted and shared, it is possible to raise the importance of tweets that are related to a person, a product, an organization, or any other entity of interest. These entities can be extremely relevant when aid is being needed in specific locations, specific time frames, etc. For detecting the entity mentions in a document, we used an out-of-thebox already trained model provided by spaCy v3.0+ 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,251.73,555.98,13.88,7.77" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. spaCy features a statistical entity recognition system with default trained pipelines that can identify a variety of named and numeric entities, including companies, locations, organizations, events, and products.</p><p>EntityMarkers. For exploiting the hashtags and the entities, we implemented the pre-trained language model with EntityMarkers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,53.80,627.87,9.82,7.77" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,65.96,627.87,11.25,7.77" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,79.55,627.87,11.25,7.77" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,93.14,627.87,10.72,7.77" target="#b31">32]</ref>. First, our model extends the RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.78,627.87,15.06,7.77" target="#b19">[20]</ref> model applied to text classification and we add two dense linear layers with softmax activation for the separate tasks: information type and priority. Next, we augment the input tweet with a series of special tokens. For example, the tweet in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,201.25,671.70,4.51,7.77">1</ref> becomes enhanced with extra information as in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,162.99,682.66,3.36,7.77" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Other Priority Classification Methods</head><p>We also explore the bag of words representation (term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting) and two classical machine learning approaches for predicting the priority. 4.2.1 Support vector machine (SVM) with mixed word ngrams. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most practiced machine learning methods for classifying text due to the fact that it is independent of the dimension space of the feature <ref type="bibr" coords="3,495.26,332.42,13.61,7.77" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We used TF-IDF weighting since due to the writing style used on Twitter, social media languages would likely be less informative while comprising a large portion of high-frequency terms, thus should be penalized. We experimented with unigrams, bigrams, and both representations. Our results showed that the combination is the best representation for the SVM classifier, as unigrams by themselves hardly seemed meaningful while it is suspected that they can serve as complements to bigrams. We report one internal SVM-based run as (b) in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,553.06,420.09,3.32,7.77" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Logistic regression (LR) with word and character ngrams.</head><p>Words are often thought to be the traditional "grain", observable for feeding texts into classifying algorithms. Subwords models are often used to overcome the limits of generalization when token forms vary too much <ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.92,480.35,14.13,7.77" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,432.28,480.35,11.92,7.77" target="#b18">19]</ref> or when lemmatization or stemming remains difficult in some languages <ref type="bibr" coords="3,468.11,491.31,14.19,7.77" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,484.53,491.31,10.65,7.77" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Here, we do not consider words but character strings. Since words are just a subset of all character strings of a text, we believe that, with an appropriate choice of n-gram size, it is possible to get some strong baseline without tokenization or even pre-processing. Our experiments showed that character n-grams with 𝑁 = 4 showed the best results, and we report an internal result as (a) in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,461.00,557.07,3.43,7.77" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. It seemed that shorter ngrams failed to store the sequential aspect of language while longer n-grams failed to generalize since they tend to rather give sparse representations (due to anti-monotonicity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,469.99,589.94,15.07,7.77" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, a 5-gram is at the best as frequent as the 4-grams it contains). We also observed that TF-IDF weighting has a good impact on the results of this type of representation. Among the various machine learning algorithms we experimented, LR was the best performing one (Section Other Priority Explore Methods in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,446.60,644.74,3.24,7.77" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In our internal experimental setup, we produced a train-test split, considering that the test set should contain unknown event types. Thus, for the training set, we selected the event types from 0 to 64, To evaluate the performance of such systems, the following two groups of metrics were proposed by the organizers:</p><p>• Information Type: its overall classification accuracy, microaveraged across events and macro-averaged across information types, its overall F1 score, macro-averaged across all information types and micro-averaged across events; and its F1 score among six actionable information types (GoodsServices, SearchAndRescue, MovePeople, NewSubEvent, Emerg-ingThreats, ServiceAvailable); • Prioritization: its overall prioritization error, micro-averaged across events and macro-averaged across all information types and information priority score correlational performance (Pearson correlation). • Also, nDCG@100 is reported: a normalized, discounted cumulative gain evaluated across the top 100 tweets, microaveraged across all test events.</p><p>The TREC-IS edition evaluated each participating run across two axes: information type categorization, and information criticality (tweet priority). Table <ref type="table" coords="4,132.62,646.72,4.39,7.77" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents our internal evaluation results, with two sets of experiments: one that used a commonly used sequence length of 256, and the other with the maximum tweet tokens, 280.</p><p>For information type classification, we underlined the first two best results in each set. For prioritization, we underlined the results with a value &gt; 30.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Submitted Runs</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,339.04,385.05,4.39,7.77" target="#tab_2">2</ref> compares our submissions with the mean, median, minimum and maximum scores of TREC Incident Streams 2021. The following are our runs that were submitted to this edition of the track:</p><p>• (4) + (2): A simple encoder with two additional Transformer layers proved to be efficient regarding the detection of the information type obtaining the highest F1 score on the actionable types (compared to our runs), while entities helped in discerning better between the levels of criticality.</p><p>-Information Type: (4) RoBERTa-base + 2×Transformer with a sequence length of 256; -Priority: (2) RoBERTa-base + E(ntities). • (5) + (1): The highest F1 score for all information types and F1 for priority detection in actionable types were obtained by augmenting the tweets with our pre-processed hashtags, with and without additional Transformer layers.</p><p>- -Information Type: RoBERTa-base + 2×Transformer + event type + event title with a sequence length of 280; -Priority: SVM TF-IDF mixed. -Information Type: RoBERTa-base + 2×Transformer + event type + event title with a sequence length of 280; -Priority: RoBERTa-base + 2×Transformer + event type + event title + # with a sequence length of 280.</p><p>When comparing Table <ref type="table" coords="5,147.91,471.37,4.39,7.77" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="5,190.58,471.37,3.30,7.77" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we first observe that our internal results have the same distribution as the official TREC results. For the prediction of the information type, the F1 scores for all information types, as well as for the actionable ones, are generally lower when no additional Transformer layer is used, and the highest when over two layers are added. Also, when comparing the importance of entities, hashtags, or events, we notice that augmenting the tweets with the event title and type outperforms the models that use entities. Moreover, the pre-processing of the hashtag information further increases the performance when applied together with several Transformer layers. When detecting the priority types, we observe the same tendencies when it comes to the number of Transformer layers. However, higher scores were observed when entities and hashtags were added to the base model also. Regarding the maximum length of the tweets, a marginal increase in performance was observed when using the maximum length of a tweet (280), nonetheless, they were not statistically significant.</p><p>Finally, it is clear, from our internal experimental setup, and then from the final TREC results, that augmenting the text with entities and hashtags can bring an important increase in the detection of tweet criticality, and can be further improved when the event type and title are known.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>For the participation of our team (L3i) in the TREC Incident Streams 2021, we proposed two approaches, a multitask information type and a prioritization Transformer-based model with entities, hashtags, and event types, and a classical machine learning-based method for the prioritization task. We conclude that taking advantage of learning both tasks with highlighted features (e.g., entities, hashtags) outperforms all our other methods in our experimental setup. The machine learning methods obtained high scores. However, they could not compete with the Transformer-based methods. Finally, our submissions obtained top performance for the prioritization task and scores above the median for the information type classification task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,317.96,363.44,240.25,8.06;2,317.66,374.40,81.10,8.06"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Topic example from the tweet streams curated by the TREC-IS organizers.</figDesc></figure>
