<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We have participated in three TREC 2021 tracks: Deep Learning, Health Misinformation, and Podcasts. With our three runs submitted to the Deep Learning track, we investigate the effectiveness of anchor texts in the current MS MARCO setup inspired by the two decades old statement that anchors "often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,255.98,441.01,9.52,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Therefore, we use the Webis MS MARCO Anchor Text 2022 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,279.36,451.97,14.68,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref> consisting of anchor text pointing to MS MARCO documents and combine anchor text with other features in LambdaMART models.</p><p>Our runs for the Health Misinformation track target topics that seem to be of argumentative nature, and we then attempt to rank documents higher that contain "good" argumentation. The underlying assumption is that well-argued texts contain fewer wrong, unreliable, or misleading information. Respective results for queries like "Should I apply ice to a burn?" then might not lead searchers to wrong decisions that negatively affect their health.</p><p>In the Podcasts Track, for retrieval, we classify episodes as entertaining, subjective, or containing discussions by using models that we had trained on a small set of manually labeled episodes. We test re-rankings of standard result lists by using the classifiers' confidences based on audio embeddings, text embeddings, or both combined. To generate engaging summaries, we employ only sentences classified as entertaining by our combined model. We investigate both extractive and abstractive summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DEEP LEARNING TRACK</head><p>Transformer-based re-rankers caused a paradigm shift in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,368.25,260.39,16.06,7.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>-also evident in the Deep Learning tracks with transformer-based approaches being the most effective in the previous years <ref type="bibr" coords="1,354.19,282.30,13.42,7.94" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,369.86,282.30,10.06,7.94" target="#b10">11]</ref>. We submitted three traditional learning-to-rank runs to the TREC 2021 Deep Learning track to help to diversify the judgment pool and to allow the comparison of modern transformerbased rankings with more traditional baselines. Within our three runs, we focus on the research question of whether anchor text is an effective feature in the MS MARCO scenario. We train two LambdaMART <ref type="bibr" coords="1,375.43,348.06,10.68,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> models that use anchor texts as feature type (among others) and one LambdaMART model without anchor text.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="1,349.50,369.98,4.09,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the 50 feature types that we use in the learning-to-rank models. To calculate the query-document similarity, we use four types of text: (1) the document body, (2) the document title, (3) the URL, and (4) anchor text pointing to the document. For each of these four text types, we calculate nine feature types using Anserini <ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.73,424.77,13.61,7.94" target="#b30">[31]</ref>: BM25, F2Exp, F2Log, PL2, QL, QLJM, SPL, TF, and TF • IDF scores. In addition, we use eight queryindependent document feature types including the Alexa Rank 1 or Harmonic Mean and PageRank of the domain provided by the Common Crawl, 2 as well as six query features since such features can be used by LambdaMART to learn different subtrees for different types of queries <ref type="bibr" coords="1,378.20,490.52,13.36,7.94" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>As our anchor text source, we use the Webis MS MARCO Anchor Text 2022 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,403.61,512.44,13.49,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. 3 This dataset enriches 1,703,834 documents for Version 1 and 4,821,244 documents for Version 2 of the MS MARCO document collection with up to 1000 anchor texts extracted from six Common Crawl snapshots from the years 2016 to 2021 (1.7-3.4 billion documents). The anchor text dataset already is filtered to remove "low quality" anchor texts (intra-site anchor texts, very long anchor texts that are very long, and stopword-only anchor texts). Here, we use only anchor texts extracted from the Common Crawl snapshot 2021-04 since it seems to be the snapshot in the Webis MS MARCO Anchor Text 2022 dataset closest to the crawling time of Version 2 of MS MARCO. We thus use 60.62 million anchor texts pointing to 1.14 million documents.</p><p>Using the official training and validation labels for Version 2 of the MS MARCO document collection, we train LambdaMART  nDCG@3 nDCG@10 P@1 P@3 P@10 MRR@10 models-a feature-based learning to rank approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.19,391.28,9.28,7.94" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,251.71,391.28,10.29,7.94" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.24,391.28,10.09,7.94" target="#b29">30]</ref>. In a pilot study, we trained LambdaMART models with 100, 1,000, and 5,000 trees optimized for MRR using the LightGBM framework <ref type="bibr" coords="2,279.45,413.20,14.60,7.94" target="#b16">[17]</ref> on all 50 feature types; other hyperparameters at their default values. The model with 5,000 trees had a higher MRR on the validation set than the models with 1,000 or 100 trees. The right plot in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,290.00,446.07,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the 10 most important feature types for the model with 5,000 trees: TF • IDF-scored titles are the most important but QLand QLJM-scored anchor texts follow at positions 5 and 7.</p><p>To also assess the effectiveness of anchor text in the TREC 2021 Deep Learning track setup, we submitted the following three runs.</p><p>webis-dl-1. LambdaMART model with 5,000 trees (other hyperparameters at their default values) trained on all 50 feature types (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,75.29,539.22,2.94,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); re-ranks the top-100 results of the track's official baseline.</p><p>webis-dl-2. LambdaMART model with 5,000 trees (other hyperparameters at their default values) trained on the 41 feature types without the anchor text-based feature types; re-ranks the top-100 results of the track's official baseline.</p><p>webis-dl-3. LambdaMART model with 1,000 trees (fewer parameters to prevent overfitting on the training data; other hyperparameters at their default values) trained on all 50 feature types (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,75.29,637.85,2.94,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); re-ranks the top-100 results of the track's official baseline.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,76.01,656.48,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the official effectiveness results of our runs and of the official baseline. All our runs improve upon the baseline but none of the improvements are statistically significant at a p-value of 0.05 with Bonferroni correction. Our webis-dl-3 run (1,000 trees) achieves the highest effectiveness, indicating that using 5,000 trees might overfit to the training data (even though 5,000 trees obtained higher MRR scores on the validation set in our pilot study). Comparing webis-dl-1 (with anchor text) to webis-dl-2 (without anchor text) shows that anchor text can very slightly improve the effectiveness. Still, since anchor text is assumed to be most effective for navigational queries <ref type="bibr" coords="2,393.21,338.05,9.24,7.94" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.69,338.05,11.47,7.94" target="#b12">13]</ref> and since none of the TREC 2021 Deep Learning track's topics are intended to be navigational, probably no larger effect was to be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">HEALTH MISINFORMATION TRACK</head><p>Our six runs for the Health Misinformation track focus on investigating whether re-ranking with axioms that capture facets of argumentativeness can improve the "helpfulness" while reducing the "harmfulness" of results for queries that seem to be of argumentative nature (i.e., not just factual look-ups).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Initial Retrieval with BM25 and MonoT5</head><p>We index the document collection using Anserini <ref type="bibr" coords="2,503.27,473.54,14.81,7.94" target="#b30">[31]</ref> (plain text extraction with Jsoup, stopword removal with Lucene's default stopword list for English, Porter stemming). Our first baseline run webis-bm25 uses Anserini's BM25 implementation (default values 𝑘 = 0.9, 𝑏 = 0.4), our second baseline run webis-t5 uses PyGaggle's<ref type="foot" coords="2,554.49,515.23,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_0">4</ref> default MonoT5 model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.88,528.34,14.71,7.94" target="#b25">[26]</ref> castorini/monot5-base-msmarco to rerank the top-50 BM25 results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Argumentative Axiomatic Re-ranking</head><p>For each of the two baselines (BM25 and MonoT5), we have two further runs that re-rank the baseline's top-20 results for queries that seem to be argumentative (i.e., not just "simple" factual look-ups). The re-ranking is based on axioms capturing argumentativeness and we largely applying the same re-ranking strategy as in our previous TREC participations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.12,628.96,9.33,7.94" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,439.69,628.96,6.14,7.94" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.08,628.96,6.22,7.94" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Identifying Argumentative</head><p>Queries. Based on the assumption that users submitting "argumentative" queries (i.e., not simple factual look-ups) will prefer documents containing good argumentation-that then might contain fewer wrong or misleading information-, we first check which of the Health Misinformation track's topics are argumentative. We manually inspected all topics and, given their non-factual health-related nature (e.g., "Should I apply ice to a burn?"), concluded that all of them could be labeled as argumentative queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Re-ranking Axioms.</head><p>To re-rank the top-20 baseline results, we use three axioms that prefer argumentative documents from our previous years' runs submitted to the Common Core, Decision, and Health Misinformation tracks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,180.32,316.15,9.33,7.94" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.90,316.15,6.14,7.94" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,200.28,316.15,6.22,7.94" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Retrieval axioms (i.e., formally defined constraints applied to retrieval models) have been developed within the field of axiomatic thinking in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="3,173.98,349.02,10.45,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to define heuristic constraints that good retrieval models should probably fulfill. A basic example is the term frequency axiom TFC1 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.63,370.94,13.61,7.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: for a single-term query, from two documents of the same length, the document with more query term occurrences should receive a higher retrieval score. We follow the ideas of axiomatic thinking and apply three axioms that capture document argumentativeness. In contrast to the restrictive "same length"-assumption in TFC1, we relax the preconditions to ensure the axioms' practical applicability.</p><p>Axiom ArgUC (Argumentative Units Count). The general idea of the ArgUC axiom is to favor documents that contain a larger number of argumentative units.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 be an argumentative query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two documents retrieved for 𝑄, let count Arg (•) be the number of argumentative units in a document, and let ≈ 10% indicate "equality" up to a 10% difference. If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and count Arg (𝐷 1 ) &gt; count Arg (𝐷 2 ), then 𝐷 1 should be ranked higher than 𝐷 2 .</p><p>Axiom QTArg (Query Term Occurrence in Argumentative Units). Retrieved documents usually consist of argumentative and nonargumentative units or text passages. The general idea of the QTArg axiom is to favor documents where the query terms appear closer to or in more argumentative units.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 = {𝑞} be an argumentative single-term query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two retrieved documents, and let 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 be the set of argumentative units of a document 𝐷. If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and 𝑞 ∈ 𝐴 𝐷 1 for some 𝐴 𝐷 1 ∈ 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 1 but 𝑞 ∉ 𝐴 𝐷 2 for all 𝐴 𝐷 2 ∈ 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 2 , then 𝐷 1 should be ranked higher than 𝐷 2 .</p><p>Axiom QTPArg (Query Term Position in Argumentative Units). Following the general observation that in relevant documents the first occurrences of query terms are closer to the beginning of the document <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.92,223.00,13.40,7.94" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.50,223.00,10.05,7.94" target="#b28">29]</ref>, the QTPArg axiom favors documents where the first appearance of a query term in an argumentative unit is closer to the beginning of the document.</p><p>Formalization. Let 𝑄 = {𝑞} be an argumentative single-term query, 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 be two retrieved documents, and let the first position in an argumentative unit of a document 𝐷 where the term 𝑞 appears be denoted by 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 ). If length(𝐷 1 ) ≈ 10% length(𝐷 2 ) and 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 1 ) &lt; 1 st position(𝑞, 𝐴𝑟𝑔 𝐷 2 ), then 𝐷 1 should be ranked higher than 𝐷 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Argumentative Unit Detection.</head><p>The above argumentative axioms are based on argumentative units. To detect argumentative units in documents, we use the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF-based argument tagging tool TARGER <ref type="bibr" coords="3,395.33,362.63,9.63,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>; available via an API. <ref type="foot" coords="3,487.92,360.48,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_1">5</ref> As input, TARGER accepts a text, and it returns markers indicating the beginning and end of argument premises and claims (argumentative units).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Actual Runs.</head><p>In addition to the three argumentative axioms, we also employ the axiom ORIG <ref type="bibr" coords="3,458.22,411.94,14.64,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that simply returns the preferences of the initial BM25 or MonoT5 ranking. We do this to "balance" argumentativeness and topical relevance. Differing from the the original axiomatic re-ranking pipeline <ref type="bibr" coords="3,503.72,444.82,13.22,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we do not train the weights for the axioms but apply two simple strategies distributing a total weight of 1.0 to the four axioms: (a) we manually set the weights such that at least two argumentative axioms have to agree to "overrule" the ORIG preference (runs webis-bm25-ax1 and webis-t5-ax1; weights: ORIG gets 0.22 and the argumentative axioms each get 0.26) or (b) we manually set the weights such that all three argumentative axioms have to agree to overrule the ORIG preference (runs webis-bm25-ax3 and webis-t5-ax3; weights: ORIG gets 0.49 and the argumentative axioms each get 0.17).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation</head><p>In the Health Misinformation track, the retrieval effectiveness of the submitted runs is evaluated using nDCG, precision, and a compatibility measure. To this end, NIST assessors labeled the usefulness, correctness, and credibility of documents. The compatibility measure combines these three aspects into preference orderings for the document helpfulness and harmfulness.</p><p>The results for our runs in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,452.41,644.07,4.25,7.94" target="#tab_3">3</ref> show that no real effect of the axiomatic re-ranking can be observed. The reason is that the axioms very rarely overrule the ORIG preference. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PODCASTS TRACK</head><p>We participated in the retrieval and summarization tasks of the TREC 2021 Podcasts track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Retrieval Task</head><p>We submitted four runs for this task employing Elasticsearch's BM25 retrieval model. These four runs consist of one baseline without re-ranking and three runs including a supervised re-ranking method that use audio features, text features, and both, respectively. For the supervised methods, we manually annotated 1,000 podcast segments (length of 2 minutes) for each of the three re-ranking criteria: entertaining, subjective, discussion. Each podcast segment was annotated by a single annotator. We used the training queries and our baseline to retrieve these segments. Using an SVM classifier, the different feature sets are then employed to train (on the annotated data) and predict (on the segments retrieved for each topic in the final evaluation) whether a segment is entertaining, subjective, or contains a discussion. The results are then re-ranked by multiplying their BM25 score with the SVM's confidence for the respective criterion (a value between 0 and 1).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Summarization Task</head><p>We submitted two runs for this task, an abstractive and an extractive summarization system. We tested to generate summaries biased towards the most entertaining sentences of the episodes, which we expect to be especially suitable to encourage consumers to listen to the whole episode. We employ the combined features model of the retrieval task (Section 4.1) to determine which sentences are entertaining, and use the confidence of the classifier as a proxy for how entertaining a sentence is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Actual</head><p>Runs. The run Webis pc abstr (abstractive) employs a DistilBART<ref type="foot" coords="4,388.23,381.79,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_2">6</ref> summarization model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,478.65,383.94,13.37,7.94" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, finetuned on the CNN/DailyMail corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="4,407.30,394.90,13.61,7.94" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,423.74,394.90,11.59,7.94" target="#b24">25]</ref> to create a textual summary for an episode. As input to the model, we use a concatenation of up to 25 sentences in their original relative ordering in the episode: the 5 sentences with the highest confidence for being entertaining according to our SVM classifier, as well as the respective previous and following two sentences (when they exist). The audio summary of this run is not abstractive but simply concatenates the up to 25 selected sentences in their original relative ordering in the episode until a length of one minute is reached or all 25 sentences are included.</p><p>The run Webis pc extr (extractive) employs the TextRank algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,341.60,515.45,14.85,7.94" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to rank the episode's sentences, using the 10 highest ranked sentences as the summary-in their original relative ordering in the episode. TextRank applies PageRank on a weighted graph with nodes representing sentences and the starting edge weights being the "similarity" of the sentences. As the similarity, we employed a sum of two components: (1) the cosine similarity of their sentence embeddings, extracted using a sentence transformer model<ref type="foot" coords="4,340.22,590.01,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_3">7</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,346.33,592.16,13.26,7.94" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and (2) the sum of our SVM classifier's entertainment confidences for the two sentences. The audio summary concatenates the 10 sentences until a length of one minute is reached or all 10 sentences are included. <ref type="table" coords="4,418.21,641.47,4.17,7.94" target="#tab_6">6</ref> shows the effectiveness of both runs. Without achieving any "excellent" score and only very few "good" scores, both runs perform very poorly-substantially below the one-minute baseline. Further investigations are needed to identify reasons for this poor summarization quality. Like for retrieval, possible explanations are a misconception of the ranking criteria on our side (leading to false annotations of the training data) or general problems in the generalizability of our approaches. Another problem might be that our hypothesis is wrong (focusing on entertaining sentences leads to especially engaging summaries) and would have led to a poor quality even if the classification had worked perfectly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In the Deep Learning track, we investigated the effectiveness of anchor text-based features in LambdaMART-based re-rankings of the official track baseline. The experimental evaluation only showed some very slight improvements when anchor text-based features are used-the non-navigational topics of the TREC 2021 Deep Learning track simply do not really benefit from anchor text.</p><p>In the Health Misinformation track, we investigated whether axiom-induced preferences that capture argumentativeness lead to more relevant and helpful search results. The experimental evaluation showed no effect since the axioms hardly ever changed the BM25 or MonoT5 baseline ranking preferences.</p><p>In the Podcasts track, we investigated the effectiveness of supervised approaches using both text and audio embeddings. The experimental evaluation showed that our re-ranking decreased the effectiveness for every instance in the retrieval task while our summaries generated from entertaining sentences could not reach the one-minute baseline in the summarization task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,53.50,84.49,504.70,172.67"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(Left) Feature types employed in our Deep Learning track runs (9 anchor text-based query-document feature types not used in run webis-dl-2).
