<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Conversational search has gathered a lot of interest both by industry with the rise of smart assistants, and subsquent domestic products that include such assistants, as well as by the academic comunity, where the CAsT track is a manifestation of this interest and a joint effort to obtain offline datasets for conversational search. Conversational information seeking (CIS) appears as the next step to drift from the usual keyword-based search paradigm. Both users and systems are formatted for interacting with search through keywords, where queries are short and lack conversational elements, such as context. Conversational search intents introduce novel and difficult challenges to which search engines are not sensible. The introduction of a fine-grained context dependency between utterances introduces problems such as coreference resolution, and lack of commonsense knowledge.</p><p>Our work explores the contextual approximation of the user's information need through query reformulation using pre-trained language models. Moreover, we also focus on keeping track of conversational context using the entities that appear throughout the conversation to identify relevant documents that could improve early-precision, by giving more weight to entities that were disregarded during the ranking process.</p><p>Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 formalize our query rewriting and entity centrality approaches. Section 4 discusses our results. Section 5 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Our work is related to research in conversational search and entitydriven reranking. Conversational Search A common approach for conversational search includes a query rewriting model that first reformulates a raw, de-contextualized, query and then uses a standard search setup such as a BM25 initial ranker followed by a pre-trained language model for reranking such as BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,179.86,668.62,14.61,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.28,668.62,13.24,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Recent research <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.80,679.57,9.30,7.94" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,65.34,679.57,10.30,7.94" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,77.89,679.57,10.30,7.94" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.43,679.57,11.51,7.94" target="#b23">24]</ref> have used variants of this multi-stage framework by fine-tuning pre-trained language models such as T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,244.16,690.53,14.69,7.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,53.80,701.49,14.83,7.94" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as the query rewriter. There has also been work that models query rewriting as a classification problem <ref type="bibr" coords="1,474.25,199.85,13.25,7.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, in which, for each term in previous conversational turns, the task is to predict whether it is relevant or not to the current turn query.</p><p>Another direction of research has focused on leveraging dense retrieval for conversational search. Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,477.52,243.69,14.60,7.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a singlestage conversational search pipeline which integrates query reformulation into the query encoder of a bi-encoder. Similarly, Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,329.10,276.56,14.85,7.94" target="#b25">[26]</ref> use a teacher-student approach to train a query encoder, which takes as input the concatenation of the current turn and previous turns, to mimic embeddings of rewritten queries from an ad-hoc dense retriever. Entity-Driven Reranking Entities are one effective way of modeling what is important about a topic. Moreover, conversations are often about entities. These observations introduce possible ways to improve current context tracking techniques for conversational search. Previous work shows that explicitly tackling named-entities can improve many language modeling tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,483.10,375.19,9.40,7.94" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,494.74,375.19,10.18,7.94" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Neural architectures still present room for improvement while carrying conversational history, as they do not fully discriminate the important textual information available <ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.00,408.07,13.36,7.94" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Popular approaches to maintaining a conversational context include using the Transformer architecture to encode context along with information needs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.18,440.95,13.52,7.94" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.95,440.95,10.14,7.94" target="#b16">17]</ref>. While these approaches leverage on pre-trained language models to obtain semantic context they are limited by the amount of information they can encode.</p><p>External knowledge sources provide additional information that may not be explicit in documents. A fundamental aspect is the extraction and linking of named-entities across the conversation turns. Well known entity linking work includes TagMe <ref type="bibr" coords="1,530.78,506.70,10.68,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and DBPediaSpotlight <ref type="bibr" coords="1,386.98,517.66,13.49,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which used knowledge-graphs based on Wikipedia, or DBpedia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,404.29,528.62,9.47,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and their respective entity page information and connections to disambiguate the most likely entities to be linked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PROPOSED APPROACHES</head><p>Conversational search introduces context inference issues due to the multi-turn design of the CAsT track. The systems designed for this submission focus on understanding two main issues. The first explores if entities are useful to improve the early precision of the top documents by including information that may have been neglected by pre-trained language models. The second issue is the approximation of the unresolved queries to the manually resolved query set. In this section, we outline our retrieval setup and the entity reranking approach. Then we describe our query reformulation methodology.</p></div>

Query entities define the initial information intent, hence we consider them to be the strongest signal to drive the conversation.

The first stage is the text-ranker described in section 3.2. The text ranker produces the 𝑃 𝑗 ranking. The second stage analyzes 𝑃 𝑗 to estimate entity centrality scores, which are used to rerank passages more effectively. We refer to these two stages as the text-retrieval and entity centrality stages throughout this notebook.</p><p>The set of unique entities 𝐸 𝑗 , for turn 𝑗, is computed from the conversation query history 𝑄 𝑗 , and the top retrieved passages 𝑃 𝑗 of the current query 𝑞 𝑗 .

We use a threshold of 0.1 to extract entities.</p></div>

Given a query, we retrieve 1000 passages with BM25. With the top 1000 passages, we rerank them using 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 . We fine-tune 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 on the MS-MARCO training dataset of (query, non-relevant passage, relevant passage) triples.</p><p>Similarly to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.87,315.31,14.72,7.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref> our text input to the 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 is: Query: q Passage: p Relevant:</p><p>(6)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Query</head><p>Rewriting Model (𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 ). Following previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,317.96,458.61,13.22,7.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we fine-tune the text-to-text transformer (T5) model for query rewriting. Given a dataset of (raw query, conversational context, rewritten query) triples, the query rewriting model, 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 , takes as input a concatenation of the raw query and conversational context and outputs a rewritten query. The conversational context c = {𝑞 1 , 𝑝 1 , 𝑞 2 , 𝑝 2 , • • • , 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑝 𝑖 } consists of previous conversational queries 𝑞 𝑖 and previous retrieved answers 𝑝 𝑖 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</head><p>In this section, we first describe the datasets used for training our multi-stage pipeline. Next, the training details for the fine-tuning of 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 are described. The four proposed systems' are presented alongside their runtags. To conclude the section we compare the results of our CAsT submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets</head><p>The fine-tuning process of 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 leverages on the following datasets: QReCC <ref type="bibr" coords="3,86.04,511.69,11.73,7.70" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is a question-answering dataset that includes 14k conversations and 81k question-answer pairs from Natural Questions, TREC CAsT 2019 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,120.54,533.39,9.52,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and QuAC <ref type="bibr" coords="3,177.23,533.39,9.52,7.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Each conversation includes a raw query, a conversational context previous queries and retrieved answers and the rewritten query. QNLI <ref type="bibr" coords="3,78.12,566.49,16.34,7.70" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is a sentence pair classification dataset derived from SQuaD <ref type="bibr" coords="3,82.41,577.22,13.49,7.94" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Given a (question, sentence) pair, the task is predict whether the context sentence contains the answer to the passage or not. QNLI contains 105k training pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training</head><p>Query Rewriting Model (𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 ) To fine-tune 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 for query rewriting on QReCC, the raw query is concatenated to the conversational context with the &lt;SEP&gt; token. 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 is trained to produce the rewritten query. In addition, 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 is trained on data from QNLI to take advantage of multi-task learning. We hypothesize that the QNLI task could improve the ability of the query rewriter to infer which context is important for the current utterance. Following Raffel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.78,309.14,13.49,7.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the input to 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 for QNLI is as such:</p><p>qnli question: q sentence: s</p><p>where q is the QNLI question and c is the sentence context. We fine-tune 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 for 10 epochs using the Adafactor optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5, batch size of 4, and weight decay of 4e-5. We select the epoch with the lowest evaluation loss as our final model for inference. Query Expansion Model (𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 ) When fine-tuning 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 on QReCC the raw query is concatenated to the conversational context with the &lt;SEP&gt; token. To create expansion terms, we use terms in the rewritten query that are not in the raw query. Then the model is trained to produce the expanded terms. We train 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 is with the same parameters as 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>Inference The input used to rewrite and expand queries on CAsT is similar to the input used for training over QReCC. However, CAsT passages are longer than QReCC retrieved answers. Thus, the input to 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 is only the last three automatic canonical passages. In addition, since 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 was fine-tuned with queries that did not include expansion terms, only the rewritten queries are included in the conversational context. As such the context for a raw query 𝑟 𝑖 is as follows: <ref type="bibr" coords="3,544.52,606.20,13.68,7.94" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where q𝑖 is the rewritten query 𝑖 from 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and 𝑝 𝑖 is the automatic canonical passage for 𝑞 𝑖 .

Query and passage entities are linked, over the top 20 passages, given the 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 described in nDCG Precision Runtag Type @3 @5 @10 @5 @10 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,75.00,484.74,4.09,7.94" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the results for each of our submissions to CAsT 2021. The manual run, LTI-entity-g, shows the difference in using the rewritten queries, and indicates that there is room for improvement in our rewriter. Our manual run is slightly below the median, which confirms the strength of 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 , and how the entity centrality model is unable to detect better documents on lower positions of the ranking. Across the three automatic runs, we observe that a combination of the 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 (LTI-rewriter-tc) outperforms generating multiple queries (LTI-rewriter-5q) -based on different retrieved passages -with 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 . We originally hypothesized that generating queries based on multiple top-ranked passages would incorporate additional relevant terms that were missing from the automatic canonical passage. However, given that 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 + 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 approach only used automatic canonical passages, this difference in performance signifies that using passages that the user did not look at hurts performance.</p><p>The entity centrality based system, LTI-rewriter-g, used the queries provided by the system LTI-rewriter-tc to perform the second-stage reranking on top of the 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 . Hence, the slight improvement when using the entity centrality reranker versus the direct application of the reformulated queries over 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 . On average the number of relevant documents on the top 5 and top 10 retrieved results stays roughly the same, which indicates that the 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 is very strong, and the entity centrality is not able to detect better documents from the top 20 documents that should be placed higher in the ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>This edition of the CAsT track, our models present lower scores when empirically compared to previous editions. This can be due to the increasing dataset difficulty over the past editions. However, we can observe that our query rewritting model trails by a 7-10% gap in terms of precision, which indicates that the query rewriting is a powerful tool to address conversation contextualization, and there is still room for improvement. Moreover, we could identify that explicitly modeling entities is less useful for maintaining context when the pre-trained language model reranker provides a competitive ranking.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="4,53.50,114.66,242.15,341.02"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Experimental Results for CAsT 2021 runs. The Type column indicates whether the run is Manual (M), or Automatic (A). section 3.2. The entities on the query side were manually corrected in case of mislinks to the knowledge base. With the entity graph built over the passages and query we use the entity centrality over the graph to perform a second-step reranking using the PageRank scores.• LTI-rewriter-g (section 3.1 and section 3.3.1): Is an automatic adaptation of run LTI-entity-g, which build the graph with the entities obtained from the rewritten queries, and respective passages obtained with the approach described in section 3.3.1. • LTI-rewriter-5q (section 3.3.1): Automatic run which uses the top five ranked passages from the previous query as input to 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 . Rather than appending all five passages into one conversational context, we instead use generate five separate conversation contexts with each of the passages and generate five queries. We then append each unique query to each other and feed it into BM25 + 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 . • LTI-rewriter-tc (section 3.3.1 and section 3.3.2): Automatic run which first rewrites queries with 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 and then feeds the resolved query into 𝑇 5 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑 . The rewritten and expanded query is then fed into BM25 + 𝑇 5 𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 .</figDesc><table coords="4,60.67,114.66,226.51,37.34"><row><cell>LTI-entity-g</cell><cell>M</cell><cell>0.4618 0.4541 0.4321 0.5848 0.5013</cell></row><row><cell>LTI-rewriter-g</cell><cell>A</cell><cell>0.3688 0.3656 0.3593 0.4861 0.4304</cell></row><row><cell>LTI-rerwiter-5q</cell><cell>A</cell><cell>0.2955 0.2982 0.2919 0.4076 0.3665</cell></row><row><cell>LTI-rerwiter-tc</cell><cell>A</cell><cell>0.3671 0.3651 0.3585 0.4873 0.4291</cell></row></table></figure>
