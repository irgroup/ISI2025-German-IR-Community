<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Search engines are widely used to find health advice online <ref type="bibr" coords="1,282.73,336.18,9.52,7.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the web is plagued with misinformation about diseases and treatments <ref type="bibr" coords="1,110.56,358.10,9.33,7.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. It has been demonstrated that interacting with incorrect search results leads to poor health-related decisions being made <ref type="bibr" coords="1,75.77,380.02,9.39,7.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The TREC Health Misinformation Track pursues the development of retrieval methods that promote credible and correct information over misinformation for health-related information needs. In these working notes, we present a multistage retrieval system that our team, from CiTIUS at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), has developed for addressing this task.</p><p>Nowadays, modern architectures are often formed by a multistage pipeline, with an initial (document) retrieval phase, followed by one or more re-rankers and different combination stages <ref type="bibr" coords="1,273.83,478.65,7.20,7.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,281.03,478.65,3.60,7.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,281.03,478.65,3.60,7.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,284.63,478.65,7.20,7.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We designed an architecture that allowed us to test different signals and combinations methods to better detect misinformation, and promote correct and credible documents. The different runs submitted to the TREC track were obtained from different configurations of our processing pipeline.</p><p>These working notes are organised as follows: Section 2 briefly explains the task and its objectives, Section 2.1 presents the data provided by the organisers, Section 3 presents a high-level view of our retrieval system, Section 4 introduces the solutions that we presented to the task, and, finally, Sections 5 and 6 expose the obtained results and some conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">ADHOC RETRIEVAL TASK</head><p>The main goal of the 2021 AdHoc Web Retrieval was to develop search technologies that promote credible and correct information over incorrect information, assuming that interacting with incorrect health search results, leads to poor decisions being made.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dataset</head><p>The organisers of the track opted for the no-clean version of the C4 dataset. This corpus was created by Google to train their sequenceto-sequence T5 model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.71,410.76,9.31,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The collection is formed of text extracts from the April 2019 snapshot of Common Crawl<ref type="foot" coords="1,495.68,419.57,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , and it contains approximately 1 billion English documents.</p><p>Each topic provided by the organisers consists of a health-related query. The topic represents a user trying to determine whether or not a treatment is useful for a given disease or condition. All topics have a fixed structure (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,441.31,476.51,2.94,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), containing a stance field that states if the treatment is actually helpful or not for the disease.</p><p>If a treatment is considered helpful then correct documents will be those supportive of the treatment. If the treatment is considered unhelpful then correct documents would dissuade users from applying the treatment for the disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MULTISTAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,343.51,567.67,4.17,7.94" target="#fig_2">2</ref> presents our multistage retrieval system whose goal is to identify and promote correct and credible documents. Combining different signals and fusion strategies, we produced the runs that we submitted for the competition (see Section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document Retrieval</head><p>In this first stage, we indexed the corpus using the Anserini library <ref type="bibr" coords="1,317.96,647.86,9.27,7.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Afterwards, we applied a BM25 search whose parameters were set to 𝑘 1 = 0.9 and 𝑏 = 0.4, which is a setting in the range of their recommended values. We employed Pyserini's<ref type="foot" coords="1,492.41,667.63,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_1">2</ref> implementation of BM25. This outputs an initial ranking of documents ordered by decreasing estimation of relevance to a query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Passage Re-ranking</head><p>The main goal of this stage was to skip the noisy or offtopic parts of the texts and focus on the most relevant passages. To that end, we utilised state-of-the-art neural re-ranking technology. More specifically, our method is based on Nogueira's work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.82,319.39,14.85,7.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which used the T5 model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.03,330.35,10.67,7.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for predicting document relevance and ranking. In our case, we took advantage of the Python library Pygaggle<ref type="foot" coords="2,290.17,339.16,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_2">3</ref> that provides models already fine-tuned for a passage ranking task. We opted for a monot5-base model trained on the Med-MARCO, a medical subset of MS MARCO passage ranking dataset.</p><p>At prediction time, a sliding window over the documents was applied (window size was equal to 6 sentences and the stride was equal to 3), and the passage selected was that producing the highest score. The ranking of documents was then reordered based on this score. Following the lessons learnt from our experiments in 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,53.80,439.94,13.22,7.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we opted for reordering the top 100 documents based on their high scoring passages, while the documents ranked from the 101th position remained in their original positions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Passage Reliability Prediction</head><p>Two alternative approaches were tested for passage reliability estimation, namely: a supervised classifier and a sentence similarity unsupervised strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Supervised approach.</head><p>A T5-base model was fine-tuned to classify passages as "reliable" or "unreliable" to a given query: 𝑄𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑦 : 𝑞 𝑃𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒 : 𝑝 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 : The model was trained using the 2019 Decision Track data and the 2020 TREC Health Misinformation Track data. It should be noticed that we kept only the topics that contained at least one harmful document. Moreover, two different labelling approaches were tested: first, categorising as "reliable" the documents labelled as 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 = 1 in the qrels and as "unreliable", the ones labelled as 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 = 0; and second, considering as "reliable" the ones labelled as 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 = 1 and 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 = 1, and the remaining ones as "unreliable". The latter labelling strategy yielded the best results in preliminary experiments (e.g., training with 2019 decision track data and testing with 2020 TREC health misinformation data) and, thus, we adopted this method for the submitted runs.</p><p>We also experimented with the following two alternatives: i) feeding the model with the unmodified "description" field upfront the passage (run citius.r8) or ii) feeding the model with a derived correct sentence obtained from the "description" and "stance" fields (run citius.r7). See Section 3.5.1 for more details.</p><p>A T5-base model was fine-tuned with a constant learning rate of 3 × 10 -4 for a variable number of iterations depending on the dataset size and with batches of size 8. We performed 2 training epochs and selected a max length of 512 input tokens.</p><p>At prediction time, a softmax function was applied over the "reliable" and "unreliable" tokens. Then, documents were re-ranked according to the probabilities assigned to the "reliable" token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Unsupervised approach.</head><p>An unsupervised approach based on sentence similarity was also included into our system. To that end, a derived correct sentence obtained from the "description" and "stance" fields (see Section 3.5.1) was encoded and compared with each sentence in the most relevant passage of the document.</p><p>This encoding was carried out with Sentence BERT models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,543.03,469.49,13.24,7.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that these models perform much better than traditional BERT models for sentence similarity tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,533.98,491.41,13.36,7.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The cosine similarity measure is applied on the obtained embeddings and used as ranking value (its mean over all passage sentences). An example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,476.19,524.28,3.07,7.94" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Rank Fusion</head><p>As a final step, our system allows to combine different scores from the previous stages (document ranking, passage re-ranking and passage reliability estimation) to generate a final ranking. We followed two unsupervised rank fusion strategies:</p><p>• CombSUM <ref type="bibr" coords="2,383.52,609.60,13.23,7.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which is a score-based technique that sums the scores that the document has in the ranked lists. In our case, the scores were first normalised 4 . • Borda Count <ref type="bibr" coords="2,391.38,642.47,13.51,7.94" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.13,642.47,10.14,7.94" target="#b15">16]</ref>, which is a rank-based technique that implements a voting scheme. Each document gets votes from each ranked list, and these votes are added. The number of votes depends on the document's position in the list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">NLP improvements</head><p>3.5.1 NLP syntactic parser. The initial re-ranking approach explained in Section 3.2 comes with the power of modern Transformerbased architectures but also with their inherent caveats. In this task, it is particularly relevant their lack of consistency: slight changes in the input query's formulation may greatly affect the result of the model, as opposed to traditional bag-of-words models.</p><p>The model should rank taking into account the "description" and "stance" fields present in the topics, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,238.65,178.20,3.01,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Making these inputs Transformer-friendly may be tricky and two configurations were tested: using the query as it is (without the stance) or paraphrasing the description into an affirmative or negative sentence depending on the stance (equivalent to generating a correct statement). We observed that the second method performed significantly better and boosted MonoT5's performance (in experiments with 2020 data). This was confirmed in the results of our participation this year (see Section 5).</p><p>To make such transformation, an algorithm built upon a syntactic constituency parser was used. The chosen parser (CRF Constituency Parser based on RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="3,145.55,298.75,13.77,7.94" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) is state-of-the-art for this task. Faster models yielding lower performance may be desirable depending on the application. Using this parser, we were able to automatically transform the question into an affirmative or negative sentence, inserting a negation depending on the stance. For example, the generated correct sentence from Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,195.43,353.55,4.09,7.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref> would be "Dexamethasone is a good treatment for croup".</p><p>The same strategy was applied to generate correct sentences for the unsupervised approach of the passage reliability prediction explained in Section 3.3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Paraphrasing technology.</head><p>The unsupervised method from Section 3.3.2 was observed to have substantial performance improvements by manually making small variations in the queries. For example, instead of "Dexamethasone is a good treatment for croup", equivalent inputs may be "Dexamethasone can be used to treat croup" or "Dexamethasone may cure croup".</p><p>To introduce this approach into the pipeline, a T5-based automatic paraphraser was built, based on Ceshine Lee's available models on Huggingface<ref type="foot" coords="3,139.87,499.91,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . However, these models performed badly due to the medical vocabulary present in the majority of queries. To address this issue, a vanilla T5-base was first pretrained using a standard unsupervised masking procedure with COVID-19 related research papers (CORD-19 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="3,181.75,545.89,12.94,7.94" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Code is available for this pretraining <ref type="foot" coords="3,95.05,554.70,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_4">6</ref> as well as the fine-tuned model <ref type="foot" coords="3,215.16,554.70,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_5">7</ref> .</p><p>The model had now seen lots of medical terms during pretraining. Hence, applying the general non-medical paraphrasing fine-tuning resulted in excellent paraphrasing performance. It also shows the importance of pretraining in large Transformer models, allowing us to accomplish a task for which there was no specific data (medical sentence paraphrasing).</p><p>Since this technology is introduced into the unsupervised approach in Section 3.3.2, which already uses SentenceBERT for passage-query alignment, we only use the two most dissimilar paraphrases to the query. Note that under the cosine metric for sentence similarity, comparing a similar paraphrase with a sentence of a passage instead of the query will not make any difference. Language models use perplexity as a measure of how well the underlying probability distribution fits the observed sentence. Perplexity is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,365.78,314.00,192.42,16.27">𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑙 (𝑤 1 , 𝑤 2 , . . . , 𝑤 𝑛 ) := 2 -𝑛 𝑖=1 log 2 𝑝 (𝑤 𝑖 ) 𝑛<label>(1)</label></formula><p>It is often used as an evaluation metric for a model, but it can also be used to measure the likelihood of a given sentence under the model. By setting the perplexity limit to consider a sentence "unlikely" really high, the model can be used to discard the noisiest and less plausible sentences without affecting the rest of the text (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,345.89,391.72,2.94,7.94" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</p><p>For this task, there is no need for a complex model, since it is meant to just distinguish between correctly formed phrases and notorious boilerplate. We chose a simple bigram probabilistic model, which is both fast and adequate for perplexity computation.</p><p>The training corpus for the perplexity models needs to be a clean, well-formed set of text. To this end, we selected the set of abstracts from the CORD-19 research papers, as a curated source of training data for the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RUNS</head><p>Taking all of this into account, we generated and submitted 10 different runs using our multistage retrieval system:</p><p>• citius.r1: this run consisted of an initial document level BM25 search plus a MonoT5 passage re-ranking of the top 100 retrieved documents using the correct sentence derived from the "description" and "stance" fields for each topic (see Section 3.5.1). • citius.r2: initial doc-level BM25 search plus a passage reranking of the top 100 retrieved documents based on the CombSUM fusion of three scores: BM25 score, MonoT5 most relevant passage score using the "description" field, and passage reliability score obtained with the unsupervised approach (RoBERTa Large STSB model<ref type="foot" coords="3,478.32,648.27,3.38,6.44" target="#foot_6">8</ref> ). • citius.r3: same as citius.r2, but using RoBERTa Base STSB v2 model instead 9 .</p><p>• citius.r4: same as citius.r2, but including paraphrases for the unsupervised strategy of estimating passage reliability (see Section 3.5.2). • citius.r5: same as citius.r3, but including paraphrases for the unsupervised strategy of estimating passage reliability (see Section 3.5.2). • citius.r6: same as citius.r2, but removing passage sentences with a perplexity &gt; 15𝐾 prior to the sentence similarity comparison (see Section 3.5.3). • citius.r7: initial doc-level BM25 search plus a passage reranking of the top 100 retrieved documents based on the Borda fusion of three scores: BM25 score, MonoT5 most relevant passage score, and passage reliability score obtained with the supervised approach (section 3.3.1) using the correct sentence as input along with the passage. • citius.r8: same as citius.r7, but using the topic's description unmodified instead of the derived correct sentence along with the passage. • citius.r9: same as citius.r2, but MonoT5 uses the correct sentence instead of the "description" field alone to estimate the most relevant passage. • citius.r10: same as citius.r3, but MonoT5 uses the correct sentence instead of the "description" field alone to estimate the most relevant passage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">RESULTS</head><p>The track organisers distinguished between systems that only made use of the query (automatic runs) and those that utilised other fields of the topics (manual runs). In our case, most solutions were considered as manual. In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,164.04,411.08,3.01,7.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the results for our manual runs are reported, meanwhile, in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,165.34,422.04,4.17,7.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref> the results for the automatic runs are shown. The track organisers also provided us with a baseline BM25 run (first row). As expected, manual runs, which employ the stance field, perform better than automatic runs. citius.r1 is the most promising automatic run. In general, it appears that using the correct sentence in the passage re-ranking stage (citius.r1, citius.r9 and citius.r10) enhances performance. However, it seems that including other signals within our ranking process worsens performance.</p><p>On the other hand, if we take a look at the runs that use MonoT5 with the description alone, two of them stand out: citius.r3 and citius.r5. These used the RoBERTa Base STSB v2 model for sentence similarity, and the second one also included paraphrasing. In terms of the competition, we ended ranked as the third-best team, being our best automatic solution citius.r1.</p></div>

This approach represents the foundation of our participation in the TREC 2021 Health Misinformation Track.</p><p>We have submitted ten different runs, and some interesting conclusions could be extracted.
