<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes our approaches to the opinion retrieval and blog distillation tasks for the Blog Track. For opinion retrieval we employ a two-stage framework consisting of keyword search and opinion classification, where customer reviews collected from Amazon.com are used for feature selection. For the blog distillation task we consider all the blog posts belonging to a blog in order to estimate the relevance of the blog at large. To accomplish this, we first identify relevant blogs for a given topic by keyword search and then examine all the posts for each identified blog. In addition, we attempt to detect and discard spam blogs (splogs) and non-English blogs to improve system performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In 2006, TREC introduced a new track, the Blog Track, which received 57 runs from 14 different research groups world-wide <ref type="bibr" coords="1,138.20,520.33,11.59,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For the second year of the track, two tasks were tackled; one was the opinion retrieval task-continuing from the first year-and the other was the blog distillation task. We took part in both tasks, except for the polarity sub-task of opinion retrieval. The following reports on our approaches to the two tasks and the results of the official runs and some additional experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Blog Distillation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Task</head><p>The blog distillation task aims at finding key blogs for a given topic that one would like to add to her RSS reader and to read on a regular basis. Note that, unlike opinion retrieval, this task is not concerned with whether the blogs are opinionated or not. There are 45 topics created in advance by the participants, and for each topic we return a ranked list of up to 100 blog feeds. The primary metric used for this task is MAP. More details can be found at the official Blog Track Wiki. <ref type="foot" coords="1,512.41,308.98,3.99,7.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Our Approach</head><p>For this task, we consider all the blog posts belonging to a blog in order to estimate the relevance of the blog at large. To accomplish this, first we search for blogs that are possibly relevant to a given topic using its title as a query. Then, after discarding non-English blogs and splogs as described shortly, we search for blog posts belonging to each of the initially retrieved blogs using the same query (topic title). In order to assess the relevance of each blog for the topic, we plot the topical relevance (cosine similarity in this study) of the blog posts for the blog along their posing dates. We regard the area under the line as the overall relevance of the blog. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,552.55,512.02,5.45,9.74" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates our proposed framework described above.</p><p>The following sections detail some of the key components within the framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Non-English Blog Detection</head><p>As the Blog Track targets only English contents, all non-English blogs can be seen as noise <ref type="bibr" coords="1,500.18,624.27,11.59,9.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Thus, it is expected that, if one could precisely detect and discard non-English blogs, it would improve system performance. To this end, we employ a character-based n-gram model to distinguish non-English from English blogs.  For this experiment, we built a character-based 3gram model with the simple Jeffreys-Perks law smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,72.21,270.80,12.72,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> using the Reuters-21578 corpus consisting of 21,578 news stories. <ref type="foot" coords="2,145.78,282.38,3.99,7.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> For each permalink file in the blog06 corpus, we extracted its textual contents (represented as a character sequence c 1 . . . c n ) and computed the cross entropy on the 3-gram model as in</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,100.06,346.02,148.28,55.21">H ≈ - 1 n log P(c 1 . . . c n ) ≈ - 1 n i log P(c i |c i-2 , c i-1 ),</formula><p>with a 2nd order Markov approximation. The lower the value of H is, the more likely the input character sequence c 1 . . . c n is English. When H for a given character sequence is greater than a predefined threshold t, we regarded it as non-English. We set t = 3.553 such that t separates two normal curves, each representing English and non-English contents, with the predicted error rate being 1% for English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Graphical Relevance Aggregation</head><p>Given a set of initially retrieved blogs obtained by "blog search" (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,144.55,570.89,3.94,9.74" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), we estimated the overall relevance of each blog B for a given topic by graphical relevance aggregation described below. We first computed the cosine similarity score s i between the topic title q and each post b i ∈ B as the topical relevance of b i . Then, those similarity scores were sorted according to the posting dates of their associated blog posts and were plotted on a graph with the x-axis being the posting dates normalized by the timespan of B. We regarded the area under the line as the overall relevance of the blog for the given topic. The rationale behind is that a good blog frequently talking about a given topic would have posts constantly having high topical relevance with the topic (query), resulting in a large area under the line. For example, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,487.42,129.79,5.45,9.74" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows topical relevance along the normalized time-line for five blogs initially retrieved for "NYC restaurants" (topic #978). Lastly, the initially retrieved blogs were ranked and output according to a descending order of the area. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Results and Discussion</head><p>We submitted four runs for this task, for which the configurations and results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,522.98,509.10,4.09,9.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. From these results, excluding splogs and non-English contents is seemingly effective for feed search; MAP improved by 5.5% compared with the baseline. Next, to examine the effectiveness of the graphical relevance aggregation described in Section 2.2.2, we simply summed up the cosine similarity scores associated with blog posts for each blog identified by the initial blog search, and ranked the blogs in a descending order of the sums. We did not use splog and non-English contents detection for this experiment. The resulting MAP was 0.1792, indicating the validity of the graphical relevance aggregation.</p><p>An even simpler approach to perform feed search without relevance aggregation would be to output the 100 feeds that are most highly ranked by the initial blog .2420 (+5.6%) Exclude non-English &amp; splogs search. We tested this approach with/without splog and non-English contents detection. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,226.01,190.82,5.45,9.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results in MAP and precision at 5 (P@5), where all the official runs are included for comparison. Contrary to our expectation, it turned out that the initial-search-only run without relevance aggregation and splogs/non-English blogs detection (the top row) performed well, obtaining over 20% higher MAP than our official runs. Although we observe some improvement among the highly ranked permalinks as indicated by P@5 for some cases, only run that beaten the initialsearch-only run in MAP is the one with non-English blog exclusion. In other words, splog detection and relevance aggregation did not improve MAP in the current settings.</p><p>To investigate the problem, we closely looked at the blog06 corpus and found that many permalink URLs were not properly extracted from the corresponding feed files.</p><p>For exam-BLOG06-feed-000017 is associated with no permalinks in 20051206/feeds-000.gz according to &lt;PERMALINKS&gt; tags, but the feed actually contains several permalinks, such as Http://www.MacHall.Com?strip id=357.</p><p>The same problem was found for BLOG06-feed-000036, BLOG06-feed-000043, and many others. Another problem is, although less frequent, that the extracted URLs are sometimes not permalinks but hyperlinks to the web pages the blog posts are commenting on. For example, see BLOG06-feed-000065, BLOG06-feed-001152, etc. These flaws may be in part harming our approach focusing on individual permalinks' topical relevance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Opinion Retrieval</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task</head><p>The opinion retrieval task intends to find blog posts which do not simply mention a given topic but ex-plicitly express opinions of the authors or commenters about it. The topic (or target) can be any concrete/abstract object including a person, a product, an event, etc.</p><p>Given 50 topics selected from a commercial blog search engine query logs, participants are required to return an ordered list of up to 1000 blog posts (documents) for each topic. The evaluation is done through the standard pooling procedure, and system performance is measured primarily by MAP. Before creating an index of the blog06 corpus, we extract textual information from the permalink files. Ideally, only the contents and comments of blog posts should be extracted as permalinks contain a variety of information not necessarily related to the posts themselves, such as advertisements. For this purpose, we developed a heuristic algorithm taking advantage of feed files and HTML tag structure similarly to Liao et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,542.55,671.99,11.59,9.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, as our preliminary experiments showed that using only the extracted contents and comments actually degraded the system performance, the experiments .2420 (-21.0%) .5111 (+15.0%)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Our Approach</head><p>reported in this paper relied on all the textual information found in permalink files. Even though it was not utilized to produce official runs, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,236.07,252.59,5.45,9.74" target="#fig_4">4</ref> presents (a digest of) the extraction algorithm for completeness.</p><p>Input: A permalink file Output: Post contents and comments (if any)</p><p>Construct an HTML tag tree for an input;</p><p>For each child node of &lt;body&gt; do Remove tags and their contents which are normally not related to post contents (e.g., &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt;); Remove tags which do not bear textual contents (e.g., &lt;br&gt; and &lt;hr&gt;); Remove tags with irrelevant id or class values (e.g., advertisement) and their contents; Remove tags with five or more &lt;a&gt; tags as their children; end Locate and extract post contents based on the post title and snippet obtained from the corresponding RSS; Locate and extract comments based on a &lt;form&gt; tag; For indexing and retrieval, we used an open source IR system, Apache Lucene, 3 equipped with the vector space model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,135.86,621.08,12.72,9.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the tf-idf term weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="4,91.19,634.63,11.59,9.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Stopwords were removed and all terms were lower-cased in indexing. No stemmer was applied.</p><p>Given a topic, we utilized &lt;title&gt; fields only as a query. In this initial retrieval phase, we limited the 3 http://lucene.apache.org/ number of retrieved documents (permalinks) to the top 2000. Then, opinion and splog classifiers were independently applied to those 2000 documents, where Support Vector Machines (SVMs) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,479.47,266.14,12.72,9.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) were experimentally tested. Instead of discarding blogs marked as "splog" or "non-opinion," we integrated classification results (confidence for prediction) with the retrieval results (cosine similarity) in the form of their product.</p><p>As the training data set for learning the opinion classifier, we used the qrels from the 2006 Blog Track where 11,234 and 8,280 documents are manually labeled as opinions (labels 2-4) and non-opinions (label 1), respectively. Note, however, that we explored to use 27,544 positive/negative customer reviews harvested from Amazon.com in order to find good sentiment terms as features.</p><p>For splog classification, 10,000 splogs randomly selected from SplogSpot<ref type="foot" coords="4,415.12,469.88,3.99,7.12" target="#foot_2">4</ref> were used as positive instances. On the other hand, since we do not have a good set of non-splogs, we regarded the relevant permalinkswhether opinionated or non-opinionated-from the Blog Track 2006 qrels as non-splogs, considering the fact that permalinks judged as relevant are typically non-splogs. To be precise, only 8.3% of relevant permalinks are reported to be splogs <ref type="bibr" coords="4,479.06,566.70,11.59,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As with the case of the opinion classifier, individual terms-which Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,449.80,595.04,12.72,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> reported to be quite effective-were used as features for splog classification. Additionally, we used two features based on hyperlink information. One was the variance of outlink URL frequencies within a permalink, which intended to capture the characteristic that splogs tend to have a number of links pointing to the same URL. The other link-based feature was the variance of the number of unique anchor texts pointing to the same URL, which represented our observation that splogs often use different anchor texts to link to the same website.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>We submitted five runs for the opinion retrieval task. The configurations of those runs and their performance in MAP for opinion retrieval (not mere topical relevance) are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,184.01,309.86,4.09,9.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>In brief, our attempts to separate opinions from nonopinions and to separate splogs from non-splogs all failed. We are currently inspecting the results to identify what has caused the problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Concluding Remarks</head><p>This year, we participated in the Blog Track and tackled the blog distillation and opinion retrieval tasks. Unfortunately, the empirical results indicate only limited success with respect to our attempts to exclude noise (i.e., splogs and non-English contents) from the system output and to estimate the overall blog relevance. We are currently analyzing the results and are examining our approaches for improvement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="2,54.00,210.85,240.12,9.74"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Our proposed framework for blog distillation.</figDesc></figure>
