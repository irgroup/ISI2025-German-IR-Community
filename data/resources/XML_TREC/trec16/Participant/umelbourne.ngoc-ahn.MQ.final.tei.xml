<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Runs</head><p>The University of Melbourne submitted runs from four systems to the TREC 2007 Million Query track, as summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="1,227.76,355.47,4.06,9.82" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The umelbstd system used the Zettair information retrieval engine (http://seg.rmit. edu.au/zettair), with the default similarity measure, which is based on a language model with Dirichlet priors. Neither stemming nor stopping was employed. The Zettair engine uses a dynamic query pruning technique to reduce query time, as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,398.40,409.71,81.50,9.82" target="#b2">Lester et al. [2005]</ref>. For the umelbexp runs, each query was first posed to a commercial search engine, with the domain for the query restricted to the .gov domain. The query was then expanded with the non-stop words contained in the first five snippets, and the expanded query was submitted to the same system as umelbstd.</p><p>The umelbimp system used the impact-based system described by Anh and <ref type="bibr" coords="1,454.44,477.51,60.62,9.82">Moffat [2005]</ref>. This approach is based on the vector space model, where each distinct term in the document collection is categorised as a dimension. An object (document or query) is represented as an impact vector in this space, where the projection of the object in each dimension is called the impact of the corresponding term in this object and is defined as an integral number valued between 0 and 8 inclusively. The similarity score between a document and a query is the scalar product of corresponding vectors, and is also integral.</p><p>The umelbsim system resulted from merging the outputs of umelbstd and umelbimp. The intention was simple: the two original runs employ different similarity measures, and, in this case, even different parsing policies, hence merging might help to improve the effectiveness. To avoid the complication caused by the different nature of the similarity scores (umelbstd gives floating point scores with almost no ties, while umelbimp gives integral scores with a great chance of ties), the merging was based on rank rather than on actual score. The new score s d for a document d is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,220.56,378.62,173.44,12.59">s d = (max +2 -r 1 d ) Ã— (max +2 -r 2 d )</formula><p>where r 1 d and r 2 d are the ranks of d in the first and second runs, respectively, and max = 1000 is the maximal rank. If a document does not appear in the result list of a run, its rank in that run is taken to be max +1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,122.28,488.07,5.45,9.82">2</ref> gives the results as provided by NIST. The MAP scores are from topics (and relevance judgments) provided in the previous three years of the Terabyte track. Documents for judging were selected in these years via pooling, although the exact method differed slightly from year to year. The judgments are therefore are "full", but only for the originally pooled systems. The runs submitted to the current track, however, may have many high-ranking documents unjudged. There is no way to tell from the MAP scores how significant these unjudged documents are; they are simply assumed to be irrelevant. In contrast, the rank biased precision (RBP) metric <ref type="bibr" coords="2,486.36,569.43,33.39,9.82;2,94.68,582.99,52.35,9.82" target="#b3">[Moffat et al., 2007]</ref> quantifies the degree of uncertainty via an error residual, reported after the plus sign in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,133.44,596.43,4.06,9.82">2</ref>. It can immediately be observed, for instance, that the umelbexp has returned a large number of unjudged documents, almost half of the documents, as weighted by RBP. In this case, it would not be surprising if most of the new documents are in fact irrelevant, as umelbexp was very much an ad-hoc experiment in doing something "different". Nevertheless, the RBP score alerts us to the possibility that the system is being unfairly penalised. A paired, two-tailed t-test on MAP scores finds significant difference between umelbexp and every other system at level p = 1e -16; umelbsim is significantly different from both umelbimp and umelbstd at level p = 0.05; but the difference between umelbstd and umelbimp is not significant. It therefore appears that the merging of the umelbimp and umelbstd into umelbsim has produced a composite system better than its components.</p><p>The staMAP and expMAP figures reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,340.80,466.83,5.45,9.82">2</ref> are estimations of MAP using methods proposed by NEU <ref type="bibr" coords="3,177.60,480.27,117.03,9.82" target="#b4">[Yilmaz and Aslam, 2006]</ref> and UMass; the figures as provided by NIST have been reported. Evidently, there is something wrong with the scale of the expMAP figures. Nevertheless, the two estimation techniques agree in ordering and relative magnitude with the "full" MAP scores, and the estimates provided by staMAP are surprisingly close to the full MAP scores -surprising, because they are based on an entirely different set of topics.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,142.92,548.07,5.45,9.82" target="#fig_0">1</ref> explores the distribution of MAP and staMAP scores for each of the submitted runs. Note that, oddly enough, staMAP produced a number of MAP estimates that were greater than 1.0; these have been omitted. Additionally, topics for which there were no relevant documents have also been excised. In each case, the MAP score observed on the historical TREC topic sets are less dispersed than the estimates produced by staMAP for the new topics, which were sampled from a real-world query log. This effect might be due to the conscious effort placed in the past into designing TREC topics that are neither too easy nor too hard, or it could be an artifact of the estimation technique in staMAP itself.</p><p>The minimal test collection or mtc method of UMass <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.48,656.43,77.67,9.82" target="#b1">[Carterette, 2007]</ref>  mating probabilities of relevance for unjudged documents, and is aimed primarily at discriminating between pairs of systems. It produces not just an estimate of the difference in MAP scores between systems, but also a variance on that estimate and a confidence that the actual difference that would result from full evaluation is non-zero. These figures were provided by NIST, and are reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,133.20,326.79,4.06,9.82" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. The mtc method gives a probability of 1.0 that full-evaluation deltas are non-zero for every pairing except for umelbstd and umelbimp, where the probability is given as 0.92. These results accord with those reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,288.00,353.91,4.06,9.82">2</ref>, although obviously once again there is a problem with scaling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Judging</head><p>The University was also actively involved in performing relevance judgments, judging a total of 28 topics. Some observations upon the judging experience might be germane. First, on the question of topic selection. Topics were chosen at random from the full query set, which was derived from a real-world query log. The assessor was then presented with a list of ten randomly selected topics, and asked to choose one to actually assess. However, the assessor's choice amongst these ten topics is far from random. The experience of the Unversity's assessor was that the underlying information need was not readily comprehensible from the query itself in most cases. The assessor is therefore constrained to choose topics that they themselves understand; and even amongst these topics, there is a natural tendency to choose the topic that is clearest. What effect this bias has upon the makeup of topics that made it into the final topic set is a matter for speculation.</p><p>Second, there is the issue of the document corpus. The Million Query track used the same gov2 collection as the Terabyte track of TREC has been using. On each occasion that this document corpus is used, one is reminded once again of the enormous volume of essentially identical pages that occur in it multiple times; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,238.92,617.07,124.47,9.82" target="#b5">Zobel and Bernstein [2006]</ref> place the proportion of redundant documents at over 25% of the collection. Serious thought needs to be given to either purging these redundant documents from the collection, or else systematically ensuring that relevance judgments made for one document in an equivalence set are carried through to the rest.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,94.68,365.79,425.09,9.82;3,94.68,379.35,171.57,9.82"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Gaussian kernel density estimates for staMAP (solid black line) and MAP (dashed red line) for each of the submitted systems.</figDesc></figure>
