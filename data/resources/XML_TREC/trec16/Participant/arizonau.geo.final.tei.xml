<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The task of TREC 2007 Genomics track is to implement a system that can answer the given biological questions through the retrieval of passages from 162K full-text HTML articles. The introduction of a new set of questions (36 official topics and 14 sample topics) in TREC 2007 Genomics track poses an interesting and a significantly different challenge from the one in 2006. Unlike the template-based questions in 2006, the questions this year required answers in the form of a list of entities that belong to the requested entity classes. For instance, antibodies, which is marked by brackets, is the requested entity type of the question "What <ref type="bibr" coords="1,455.88,375.41,66.01,9.21">[ANTIBODIES]</ref> have been used to detect protein TLR4?". In addition, the questions cover a range of 14 different biological entity classes such as genes, proteins, mutations, diseases etc. The participants were provided with 14 sample questions together with a sample passage for each of the questions, and the goal is to build a system that can find passages for the 36 official questions based on the techniques developed in answering the sample questions.</p><p>Similar to our system for TREC 2006 Genomics track, our system this year can also be divided into three major components: preprocessing, document retrieval and passage retrieval. While the overall system is composed of the same main components, the subcomponents have been substantially revised to deal with finding answers that are in the form of list entity classes. We first provide an overview of these three major components and describe some of the innovative features of our system in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preprocessing</head><p>Rather than using the HTML full-text articles, we used the structured XML format of the articles that were processed by the BioSemantics group 1 , which were made available for 2006 participants. Part of the preprocessing step is to resolve acronyms in the full-text articles using a popular acronym resolution algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.24,593.93,10.36,9.21" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The corresponding MeSH terms for each article are obtained from PubMed as well. These XML files are then indexed using both Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="1,468.84,605.45,11.05,9.21" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,616.85,11.05,9.21" target="#b2">[3]</ref> indexing systems. The reason behind using two indexing systems is to explore if the different rankings of the documents retrieved by the two systems would make any impact in the precision of the extracted passages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Document Retrieval</head><p>The document retrieval component involves the processing of natural language questions to form queries and expansion of biological entities identified by the question processor. A variety of techniques were used in the expansion of keywords, including one to determine the specificity of a keyword. In this section, we first describe our approach for question processing, then for keyword expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Question Processing</head><p>Before queries are generated, keywords have to be extracted from the natural language questions. A na√Øve approach was used in extracting keywords by finding the noun phrases from the questions and check against resources such as Entrez Gene and UMLS Metathesaurus to recognize their types. It is typical that different parts of the word sequences in the noun phrases can belong to different entity classes. In that case, such noun phrases are broken down into separate query terms. For instance, the noun phrase "lysosomal abnormalities" are broken down into "lysosomal" and "abnormalities", since "lysosomal" is recognized as part of a body region and "abnormalities" as a finding according to UMLS Metathesaurus.</p><p>Other than noun phrases, verbs and dependencies of word relations are also extracted. For questions that have certain verbs such as "detect" and "measure", the corresponding extracted passages are preferred to have mentions of experimental methods. Dependency between a noun phrase and the question requested entity type is extracted in an attempt to narrow the scope of the requested entity type. For instance, in the question "What serum [PROTEINS] change expression in association with high disease activity in lupus?", articles assigned with the MeSH term "serum protein" are preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Related Terms through Definitions</head><p>Keywords are typically expanded with their synonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms. However, definitions of terms defined in ontologies such as MeSH can be useful for the expansion of keywords. Unlike <ref type="bibr" coords="2,188.04,409.85,11.05,9.21" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which reported the use of definitions for keyword expansion decreases the performance of their system, our system does not utilize the whole definitions as expansion, but rather using only the recognized terms identified in the definitions. This can better prevent arbitrary and irrelevant terms from being used in keyword expansion.</p><p>We define term t 1 is related to term t 2 if t 1 appears in the definition of t 2 . As an example, "neurodegenerative disease" and "nervous system" are terms in the MeSH ontology. The definition of "neurodegenerative disease" is "Hereditary and sporadic conditions which are characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction", according to MeSH. From the definition, we infer that "nervous system" is related to "neurodegenerative disease".</p><p>By applying this rule to the MeSH ontology, relations of terms were built and utilized for keyword of expansion. Term t 2 is used as keyword expansion of term t 1 if t 1 is related to t 2 . Using the above example, "neurodegenerative disease" is used as an expansion of the keyword "nervous system".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Specificity of keywords</head><p>Some keywords such as "nervous system" tend to be too general to be used for queries, as relevant documents can mention entities that are related to "nervous system" rather than the actual mention of "nervous system". For instance, a relevant document can have mentions of a specific part of the nervous system (such as neurons), or a specific disease related to nervous system (such as Parkinson's disease). Inclusion of such general keywords and their expanded forms in the queries can potentially miss out relevant documents. It is therefore important to be able to determine the specificity of keywords in an automatic manner, so that general keywords are treated differently from specific keywords in the formation of retrieval queries.</p><p>Our approach is to determine the specificity of a keyword based on the MeSH hierarchy. The intuition of the approach is that if a keyword has more hyponyms (i.e. more specific terms) than hypernyms (i.e. more general terms), then the keyword should be considered as general. Let k be the number of levels that separate t from t', where t and t' are terms in the MeSH hierarchy and t' is the root ancestor term of t. Let m be the number of levels that separate t from t'', where t'' is a descendant of t and t' and t'' is the lowest leaf term of t'. We define t be a general keyword if k &lt; m, otherwise t is considered as a specific keyword.</p><p>With respect to the formation of queries, we call keywords that are required to appear in documents as essential keywords, while keywords that are preferred but not required as nonessential. In other words, documents are considered as relevant even in the absence of the non-essential keywords. Keywords that are considered as general are treated as nonessential keywords in queries, while specific keywords are used as essential keywords. Using the Lucene query syntax as an illustration, essential keywords are preceded by the "+" operator as follows:</p><p>+lysosomal +abnormalities "nervous system" The above query indicates that a relevant document must contain the words "lysosomal" and "abnormalities", and it is preferred but not required to have the phrase "nervous system".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Keyword Expansion</head><p>Our system utilizes the following types of keyword expansion: synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, related terms through definitions (as described in section 2.2) and lexical variants. The MeSH ontology is used in expanding keywords with synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms and related terms. For gene names, lexical variants are generated by recognizing breakpoints as in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,186.60,351.17,10.45,9.21" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Breakpoints of a gene name are positions in which a space or a hyphen can be inserted in order to generate variants. An example of a breakpoint for the gene "Sec61" is the position in between the letter "c" and the digit "6". With this breakpoint, variants such as "Sec-61" and "Sec 61" are generated. Another way of generating lexical variants was through the use of ADAM database <ref type="bibr" coords="3,266.88,397.25,11.05,9.21" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to get frequently occurring abbreviations.</p><p>We also utilized the fuzzy match and wildcard match features in Lucene to generate additional lexical variants of gene names other than the two approaches mentioned above. A fuzzy match is to find matches with small edit distances from the original term. This allows matches such as "MMS2" with "hMMS2" from the document collection. On the other hand, wildcard matches allow "Raf" to be matched with "Raf1" from the document collection. For fuzzy and wildcard matches of gene names, we picked the top 5 matches that had the shortest edit distances from the original term and disallowed matches that are common English words. For lexical variants of non-gene names, we only perform lemmatization to obtain their singular form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Ranking of documents</head><p>To merge the list of documents retrieved by Lucene and Indri, we used a weighted combination of the normalized scores to score and rank documents. Let d i be a document in a set of documents D. Let R = {"lucene", "indri"} to indicate the retrieval systems Lucene and Indri, and ds r (d i ) be the score for the document in which d i is retrieved by r, where r ‚àà R.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,108.00,583.01,414.01,50.08">Let DS r = { ds r (d 1 ), ‚Ä¶, ds r (d n ) }, where n = |D|. indri i indri lucene i lucene i DS d ds DS d ds d doc score max ) ( ) 1 ( max ) ( ) ( _ √ó - + √ó = Œ± Œ±</formula><p>, where 0 ‚â§ Œ± ‚â§ 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Passage Extraction</head><p>Candidate passages are extracted from the retrieved documents by the passage extraction component, which utilizes various entity recognizers and verifies the relevancy of candidate passages with the use of semantic relatedness based on MeSH and UMLS semantic network. Certain requirements of the candidate passages have to be met before they are considered as valid passages for their corresponding questions and submitted as the final results.</p><p>A passage is defined as a contiguous list of sentences from a paragraph. In our case, we limited the maximum number of sentences in a passage to be 3. Our passage extraction component takes top-k ranked articles that are relevant to the question and retrieve sentences that have the essential keywords. We call such sentences as the seed sentences. Neighboring sentences of a seed sentence are merged to form a candidate passage. Various entity recognizers are utilized to tag and identify entity classes of interest in candidate passages. Semantic relatedness based on the MeSH ontology and the UMLS semantic network is verified between the tagged entities in the candidate passages and the non-essential keywords in the corresponding question to determine relevancy of passages. Candidate passages that do not satisfy certain requirements are not considered as valid passages, and therefore would be filtered out from the final results. Valid passages are then ranked before submitting as final results. A passage p is valid with respect to question q if it satisfies the following requirements:</p><p>(i) p contains all essential keywords of q.</p><p>(ii) p contains a term that belongs to the requested entity type of q.</p><p>(iii) p contains a term t such that t and non-essential keyword w of q are semantic similar. We detail each of the main steps in extracting valid passages in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Recognition of Entities</head><p>Once candidate passages are generated based on seed sentences, recognition of entities is performed for the candidate passages to identify keywords with entity classes of interest. To recognize gene or protein names, a statistical learner named BANNER <ref type="bibr" coords="4,447.60,304.13,11.05,9.21" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was used to handle the wide variation of gene names due to the frequent use of authors' preferred way of naming genes rather than using the standardized gene names <ref type="bibr" coords="4,402.12,327.05,11.05,9.21" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,417.72,327.05,7.37,9.21" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Mutation is another complicated domain that lacks standard convention of naming mutations. Our system utilizes MutationFinder <ref type="bibr" coords="4,181.08,350.09,15.56,9.21" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which is based on a large set of regular expressions describing mutations, to recognize mentions of mutations. In the case of antibodies, mentions of antibodies are commonly prefixed as "anti-" and keywords such as "antibody" and "serotype". We also noticed it is common to mention antibodies in the form of catalog numbers from manufacturers of antibodies. We collected the catalog numbers from the major manufacturers and represented them in regular expressions. For other entity classes, we rely on the use of MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="4,152.52,419.09,15.56,9.21" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which is based on comprehensive UMLS Metathesaurus and is one of the few recognizers that can identify a huge variety of entity classes in one package. We list the UMLS semantic types used in recognizing various entity classes of interest in table </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Semantic Relatedness</head><p>Typical expansion techniques such as synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms rely on the use of ontologies. However, relevant documents can be left out when general keywords as well as their expanded forms by typical expansion techniques are used as part of the queries.</p><p>Terms related to such general keywords should be used for expansion instead, but expansion of general keywords at the query level can be difficult when related terms are considered. There can be thousands of terms that are related to a general keyword, but not every related term is relevant to the question. Inclusion of irrelevant terms in the process of query formation can affect the precision of document retrieval. However, verifying the relevancy of passages by checking the existence of semantic relations between the terms appearing in the passages and the general keywords in the question can avoid the inclusion of irrelevant passages. Assessing passage relatedness can improve the precision of the passage retrieval component of question answering systems.</p><p>To overcome the issue of general keywords, we use the idea of semantic relatedness <ref type="bibr" coords="5,493.80,236.21,16.57,9.21" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to verify the relatedness of a pair of terms with respect to their meaning. The notion of semantic similarity can be easily confused with semantic relatedness. Semantic similarity is the relatedness of a pair of terms that belong to the same class, such as a is-a relation, while terms that are said to be semantically related do not necessarily belong to the same class.</p><p>We developed a novel and scalable method based on logic programs to find semantic relatedness between a pair of terms by utilizing the MeSH ontology and UMLS semantic network. The relations we used in our component include is-a relations, relations based on the UMLS semantic network and relations based on MeSH definitions, as described in section 3.2. The relations are represented as logical facts, so that a is-a relation in the MeSH hierarchy is represented as is_a_desc(t, t'), where t and t' are MeSH terms and t is a descendant of t'. Likewise, related terms are represented as is_mesh_related(t, t'), in which t appears in the definition of t'. The predicate symbol is_related(t, t') indicates that t is semantically related to t'. Facts in the form of is_a(t, t') and is_mesh_related(t, t') collectively form a knowledge base denoted as F mesh , and the corresponding rules that describe semantic relatedness are denoted as R mesh . Below are some of the rules defined for R mesh :</p><p>is_related(X,Y) :-is_a_desc(X,Y). is_related(X,Y) :-is_mesh_related(X,Y). is_related(X,Y) :-is_a_desc(X,Z), is_mesh_related(Z,Y).</p><p>The above rules for R mesh are written in Prolog style, and the symbol ":-" indicates if. The left side of the ":-" is the head of the rule and the right side of the rule is the body or the condition. The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types. As in the approach for semantic relatedness based on MeSH, logic programs are also used to find semantic relatedness between two terms by utilizing the UMLS semantic network. Term t belonging to semantic type st is represented as is_a(t, st). causes(st 1 , st 2 ) is used to represent the fact that semantic type st 1 causes semantic type st 2 . For instance, the semantic type "cell dysfunction" has the semantic relation "causes" with the semantic type "neoplastic process". These facts in their logical forms (denoted as F UMLS ) and rules (denoted as R UMLS ) are used to infer relations between two terms. Some of the rules defined for R UMLS are as follows:</p><p>is_related(X,Y) :-is_a(X,ST1), is_a(Y,ST2), causes(ST1,ST2). is_related(X,Y) :-is_a(X,ST1), is_a(Y,ST2), is_a(Z,ST3), produces(ST1,ST3), affects(ST3,ST2).</p><p>The first rule says that term X is semantic similar to term Y if X belongs to semantic type ST1 and Y belongs to semantic type ST2, and ST1 has the semantic relation "causes" with ST2.</p><p>We say that two terms t 1 and t 2 are semantic similar if F UMLS U R UMLS |= is_related(t 1 , t 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Passage Ranking</head><p>Among the list of valid passages, the passages are ranked based on the following criteria: (i) keyword density (ii) section rank (iii) request entity type density. The scoring criterion for section rank (denoted as score_origin) is described as follows: The final score of a valid passage is simply the summation of all the four scoring criteria, and the list of passages is ranked according to the final score.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,176.04,191.40,5.09,12.08">=</formula></div>

In an attempt to extract passages of high passage MAP, only the top 50 documents retrieved by Lucene (i.e. Œ±=1 for document ranking) were used in the extraction of passages in run1. For run2, top 75 documents retrieved by Lucene and Indri with Œ± set as 0.75 for document ranking. We give higher preference to documents retrieved by Lucene since our Indri component was in an early stage of development. run3 is our interactive run based on the automatic run run1 with the modification of the queries of 8  <ref type="table" coords="6,135.72,518.57,5.54,9.21">2</ref> -The median of our official runs for four different measures compared with the median of all runs (denoted as "All").</p><p>Here we list the 8 queries that we modified in our interactive run, and group them in terms of methods used for their modification: o Extra knowledge from web resources Topic 205: What [SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS] of anxiety disorder are related to coronary artery disease?</p><p>‚Ä¢ Inclusion of the underlined terms in the query as general symptoms of anxiety disorder according to <ref type="bibr" coords="6,258.12,622.73,15.56,9.21" target="#b12">[13]</ref>: "Anxiety disorder can have massive and lasting effects on the sufferers ability to enjoy life, sufferers commonly experience symptoms such as panic attacks, phobias and many physiological anxiety disorder symptoms like shortness of breath, lethargy, insomnia and many more."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Analysis</head><p>Using the gold standard passages released by TREC, we investigated the reason behind the low document MAP achieved by our runs. Rather than measuring document MAP after passage extraction as reported in table 2, we measured document MAP based on the top 100 retrieved documents for each of the topics in our submitted runs. This allows us to determine if our passage extractor plays a role in achieving low document MAP. We realized that the document MAP is 0.1509 for our first run (run1) and 0.1204 for our second run (run2). This suggests that we should perhaps increase the number of documents used in passage extraction.</p><p>We further look into the influence of document MAP with respect to top 100, 200 and 500 retrieved documents, and how each of the keyword expansion techniques contribute to the performance of the system. The results are reported in table <ref type="table" coords="7,378.12,539.21,4.14,9.21" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, and they were evaluated after some programming-related improvements for the keyword expansion techniques. In table <ref type="table" coords="7,513.48,550.73,4.20,9.21" target="#tab_6">3</ref>, "baseline" method means that only the exact keywords were used for the retrieval without any keyword expansion. Expansion techniques such as synonyms (S), fuzzy match (F) and wildcard match (W) were described in section 3.4. Expansion of gene variants (V) included the use of ADAM database and generation of gene variants based on breakpoints, which were described in section 3.4 as well. We are rather surprised to see that only the generation of variants has a positive impact to the performance of our system. The increase in the performance is largely due to the ability to generate gene variants such as "NFkb" from "NFkappaB" in topics 234 and 235. For the other expansion techniques, there was little gain in performance only when the top 500 retrieved documents were considered.</p><p>We also evaluated the effectiveness of our novel semantic relatedness component, as discussed in section 4.2. Using the technique described in section 3.2 for determining the specificity of keywords, it was found that 6 of the 36 questions contain one or more general keywords. We applied the semantic relatedness technique to the 6 questions which contain general keywords, and evaluate the effectiveness of the component by comparing the performance of the system with and without the use of the component. We list the questions that are automatically identified to have general keywords by our component, and the general keywords are underlined in the questions. The numbers in the angled brackets indicate the topic ID, while the words in the squared brackets represent the requested entity type of the corresponding questions.  <ref type="table" coords="8,135.72,676.49,5.54,9.21">5</ref> -Performance of the system when the semantic relatedness component is not used among the questions with general keywords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We described our approach in handling the TREC Genomics questions, which are in the form of list questions for this year. One of the novel aspects of our approach is that our system determines whether a keyword is too general to be used for retrieval and utilizes MeSH ontology and UMLS semantic network for semantic relatedness. The motivation of this approach is that some questions contain general keywords, which means that using only the general keywords and their expanded forms in the queries for retrieval can potentially miss out the relevant documents. Our results show that using the semantic relatedness component can affect the performance of the system positively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="4,113.40,442.01,403.22,229.29"><head>Table 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>1.
