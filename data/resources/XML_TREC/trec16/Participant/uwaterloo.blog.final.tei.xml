<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The University of Waterloo participated in the opinion finding task of the Blog track. The task consists of finding blog posts (documents) containing an opinion expressed about the subject of the query. Each query represents a single "entity" that can be, for example, a person, product name, abstract concept, location or event. The relevance judgements were done on a 5-point scale: -1 -not judged, 0 -nonrelevant, 1 -relevant, 2 -relevant, negative opinion; 3 -relevant, mixed positive and negative opinion, 4 -relevant, positive opinion. While many elements in the language can be used to express subjective contents, adjectives are one of the major means of expressing value judgement in English. Our approach consists in using a list of 1336 subjective adjectives manually constructed by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,296.28,337.78,169.88,9.94">Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [2]</ref> for identifying opinionated contents. We hypothesise that presence of subjective adjectives within fixed-size windows around query term instances in a document is a useful feature for finding opinions directed at the query concept.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System description</head><p>Our approach to finding blogs containing opinions about the concept expressed in the query is a twostaged process. In the first stage, a set of documents is retrieved in response to the query using a topicrelevance ranking method, while in the second stage, this document set is re-ranked using opinion-finding method. The two stages are described in detail below:</p><p>In the first stage (document retrieval), 1000 documents are retrieved using BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,438.36,491.86,12.80,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref> implemented in the Wumpus IR system <ref type="bibr" coords="1,160.32,504.58,11.79,9.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The BM25 tuning parameters b and k were set to 0.75 and 1.2 respectively as they showed optimal performance in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,213.36,517.18,11.70,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We experimented with two types of queries:</p><p>-Single non-stopword terms (runs UWbaseTerms, UWopinion1 and UWopinion2); -Phrases, which were simply defined as strings of text enclosed in quotation marks by the author of the query (runs UWbasePhrase, UWopinion3 and UWopinion4).</p><p>As a result, two baseline runs UWbaseTerms and UWbasePhrase are produced using single terms and phrases respectively.</p><p>In the second stage (opinion-finding), we re-ranked the documents retrieved in the previous stage as follows:</p><p>For each query term instance in a document, we record all subjective adjectives that occur within the span of n words before and after it. We used a list of 1336 subjective adjectives manually composed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown <ref type="bibr" coords="1,215.88,694.30,11.70,9.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Proximity of the query term instance to each adjective in the window surrounding it is used to calculate the weighted tf (wf) (Eq. 1 and 2). Stemming was not used in this stage.</p><p>We compared the use of stemming with no stemming on the training data from Blog 2006, and better results were obtained without stemming.</p><p>(1) otherwise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,126.72,114.53,179.88,42.11">1 0 if ) , (<label>1 1 ) ( 1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,121.20,113.38,176.50,31.01">&gt; + = = A a p i i A a t distance t c</formula><p>Where: c(t i ) -contribution of the i th instance of the query term t occurring in the document to wf; distance(t i ,a j ) -distance in number of non-stop words between the i th instance of the query term t and subjective adjective a; p -constant, moderating the effect of the distance between t i and a; A -number of subjective adjectives within the span S before and after t i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>We compared the use of phrases with the use of single terms in the subjectivity-based document reranking algorithm described above, using as the original document set 1000 documents retrieved with single terms (UWbaseTerms run) or phrases (UWbasePhrase run). Table <ref type="table" coords="2,393.60,637.78,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_1">1</ref> summarises the submitted runs. The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,222.48,650.38,4.14,9.94">2</ref>.</p><p>As can be seen from Table <ref type="table" coords="2,192.12,675.70,4.14,9.94">2</ref>, the best opinion relevance results are obtained when the initial document set is retrieved using phrases, while the subjectivity-based re-ranking is done using single terms (run UWopinion3). This run improved performance of 35 topics in MAP compared to the baseline UWbasePhrase, and of 29 topics in P@10. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,293.64,73.30,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the differences by topic in average precision of the best opinion-finding run UWopinion3 from the baseline UWbasePhrase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run name</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2. Evaluation results of the submitted runs</head><p>The comparison of four experimental opinion-finding runs shows that using phrases in the first stage (initial document set retrieval) leads to better results than using single words (cf. UWbasePhrase and UWbaseTerms). However, following the phrase-based initial document set retrieval, it is better to use single terms in the second stage (document re-ranking using subjective adjectives). The use of phrases is important in the first stage as it helps to avoid false coordination, however, in the second stage phrases are too restrictive. For example, using a query "brand manager" (topic 929) as a phrase in the first stage is important to avoid documents with "brand" and "manager" used in unrelated contexts (cf. average precision of 0.0386 in UWbaseTerms vs. 0.2077 in UWbasePhrase). However, by using "brand manager" as a phrase in the second stage is less effective than single terms, as the author, for example, having said that "X is a brand manager" may then use the word "manager" throughout the rest of the document (cf. average precision of 0.2298 in UWopinion3 vs. 0.2077 in UWopinion4).</p><p>In determining whether to treat a query as a phrase or single terms, we relied on quotation marks placed around phrases by the user. This is not reliable, as not all users enclose phrase queries in quotes. A more reliable automatic method to determine whether a query refers to a single multi-word unit might lead to further improvements.</p><p>-0.5 -0.4 -0.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we presented a novel method for ranking documents containing opinions about the concept expressed in the query. The method uses a manually constructed list of subjective adjectives, and calculates document score based on the proximity of subjective adjectives to query term instances within fixed-size windows around them in the document. We experimented with different types of queries constructed from the topic titles: single terms and user-defined phrases, i.e. phrases enclosed in quotation marks by the user. Substantial improvements over the baseline (run UWbasePhrase) were achieved when the initial document set was retrieved using phrases, while the subjective adjective-based re-ranking was done using single terms (run UWopinion3). This suggests that subjective adjectives located close to any word from the query are useful indicators of the presence of opinions expressed about the query concept.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,85.56,312.10,440.76,9.94"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
