<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The 2007 TREC Genomics track focused on answering questions gathered from working biologists. Rather than finding an exact answer, the task was to extract passages containing answers from about 160,000 full-text scientific articles published in 49 genomics-related journals. As the task required finding passages potentially containing lists of named entities of a given answer type, and sample questions for each answer type were provided, we attempted to find answers in the form of relations characteristic of a given answer type. The relations were extracted using SemRep <ref type="bibr" coords="1,390.62,225.78,101.74,9.02" target="#b13">(Rindflesch et al, 2003)</ref>, a natural language processing system that relies on semantics and domain knowledge encoded in the Unified Medical Language System ® (UMLS ® ) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,488.27,260.22,51.83,9.02;1,324.00,271.74,39.53,9.02" target="#b10">(Lindberg et al, 1993)</ref> to determine relations between entities found in the text by MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="1,454.92,283.20,65.69,9.02" target="#b1">(Aronson, 2001)</ref>. As there were no restrictions on question type and form, we did not expect to see all question types in the training set, and therefore we did not attempt a deeper question understanding. Because of this fairly general approach and because SemRep was used "as is" without any adjustments for the task, we anticipated missing quite a few answers and the relevant passages containing these answers. Therefore we decided to combine the knowledgebased approach with corpus-based and statistical methods. The latter approaches rely upon Essie, the LHNCBC experimental search engine for biomedical text in structured XML <ref type="bibr" coords="1,428.46,432.76,69.08,9.02" target="#b7">(Ide et al, 2007)</ref>. Because SemRep processing of the whole collection is computationally intensive, only the 1,000 top documents retrieved by Essie were submitted to SemRep.</p><p>In the 2005 and 2006 tasks, our information retrieval approach, in which the spans retrieved by the base systems were merged using the sum fusion method <ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.00,536.29,91.42,9.02" target="#b5">(Fox and Shaw, 1994)</ref>, achieved good performance. This year, we used this approach as the baseline, combining retrieval results of Essie, Theme <ref type="bibr" coords="1,505.75,559.27,34.26,9.02;1,324.00,570.80,21.52,9.02" target="#b20">(Wilbur, 2002)</ref>, Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="1,374.56,570.80,102.00,9.02" target="#b11">(Metzler and Croft, 2004)</ref>, EasyIR <ref type="bibr" coords="1,515.61,570.80,24.43,9.02;1,324.00,582.26,43.55,9.02">(Ruch et al, 2006)</ref>, and Terrier <ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.50,582.26,79.09,9.02" target="#b12">(Ounis I et al, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Building upon the approach to document processing developed and tested in the 2006 evaluation, we treated each passage of text delimited by the HTML paragraph tags (the maximum-length legal spans) as an individual document. We also tested if passage retrieval could be improved by adding information about relevance of the whole full-text document containing the passage (see section 3.3). Section 2 describes preparation of the documents. Section 3 provides a detailed description of our methods. Section 4 presents some preliminary results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Document Preparation</head><p>We pulled all 12,641,127 spans identified in the official legalspans.txt file from their respective articles. To make processing easier for our various tools, we created a "cleaned" version by removing all of the HTML tags, converting HTML codes into their respective ASCII characters, and replacing all of the UTF-8 characters with their ASCII equivalents (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,100.63,200.85,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for an example). The "cleaned" spans were then indexed using EasyIR, Essie, Indri, and Terrier. The top 1,000 spans retrieved by Essie for each of the 36 official topics resulted in 29,746 unique spans to be further processed using SemRep. To facilitate processing, we split the spans into smaller sub-spans, where possible. We developed two different methods of identifying and splitting out the specific components from the spans. These two methods worked on reference-based spans since these tended to be longer and more in need of breaking up.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Original</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sub-spanning Method 1:</head><p>The first method involved identifying spans that started with the sequence of "&lt;number&gt; &lt;period&gt; &lt;space&gt;". These reference spans were very well behaved and easy to parse, for example, see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,283.08,445.32,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_0">1</ref> where we identified the span "34. Dunst …" as meeting the conditions for this method, and then we were able to correctly parse out most of the article's title from the reference. If this span had contained multiple references, all of them meeting the conditions for this method would have been parsed and assigned a unique sub-span number as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sub-spanning Method 2:</head><p>The second method used a set of 24 trigger phrases (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,122.69,571.84,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the list) to identify the ending of each specific article reference in a large reference section span.</p><p>[Abstract] The list of trigger phrases was identified by a manual review of some "cleaned" spans. We used these trigger phrase positions at the end of each reference to parse the larger span into sub-spans broken on the trigger phrases. This method was not able to parse out the specific title for each article reference as was Method I, but by using the smaller sub-spans we were better able to narrow down the part of the span that was triggering our results. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,499.74,491.30,5.01,9.02">3</ref> has an example showing the trigger phrases in bold.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,72.00,618.35,216.01,76.73">[Editorial] [Letter] [Swedish] [Abstr.] [Engl. Ed] [Med] [abstract [Abstract [Extract] [Medline] [article [Clinical conference] [Free Full Text] [Online] [comment] [CrossRef] [Full Text] [Review] [editorial] [Dissertation] [In [Russian] [letter</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying Reference Spans:</head><p>We wanted to be able to identify spans that were reference sections so we could attempt to parse the data into smaller chunks to better refine our results. We came up with two metrics for determining whether a span was a reference or not. The first method used the list of trigger phrases described above as Sub-spanning Method 2, except for reference span determination where we focused only on spans that were greater then 3,000 characters in length. If the span contained one of the triggers, it was determined to be a reference span. The second metric used punctuation to decide whether a span was a reference. We simply counted the punctuation characters in a span and if the percentage of punctuation to total length was greater then 3.19%, the span was considered to be a reference span. We used a manual review of some "cleaned" spans to determine the 3.19% cut-off, where we focused on only three punctuation symbols (period, comma, and colon) since counting all of the punctuation gave us worse results. For this second metric, we also exempted any spans that started with "Received" or "Accepted" since they contained a lot of punctuation, but were definitely not references. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,252.37,154.88,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_2">4</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Automatic answer extraction and passage retrieval</head><p>We explored two approaches to automatic answer extraction: 1) a method that involved describing the meaning of a passage of text in the form of extracted relations and entities; and 2) a pure information retrieval approach in which each passage was treated as a document and the retrieval results obtained using five search engines were merged using a method that consistently improved our results in the previous evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.1</head><p>Knowledge-based approach Our knowledge-based approach to question answering followed the Genomics track evaluation design: we identified exact answers in the form of relations, and then marked the passage as containing an answer.</p><p>With enough computing resources and a better understanding of question and answer types, this process could have been applied to the whole collection. Lacking both, we used a two-stage question answering design: we first identified "promising" passages using our in-house search engine Essie, and then submitted the passages to SemRep. SemRep results (consisting of the lists of identified entities and relations) were post-processed and combined with evidence from entity identification and Essie ranking to generate the final ranking of extracted passages. The final submitted passages consisted of the full-length legal spans trimmed to sub-spans containing relevant entities and relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Essie query generation</head><p>Essie queries consisted of three parts: 1) search terms taken from the topics, 2) expansions for search terms, where possible, and 3) broad weightings in favor of the topic answer types (domain query expansion).</p><p>Search Term Extraction: Terms were extracted from the topics using MetaMap and a list of model organisms obtained from the NCBI taxonomy of the organisms commonly used in molecular research (The NCBI Taxonomy).</p><p>Restrictions on semantic type, part of speech, and exception lists were used to rate the terms with respect to their usefulness for search as shown in  An extra index was built to store which n-grams occur in each document and how many times.</p><p>A document to n-gram index allows finding all ngrams that occur in a search result (a list of documents). If an n-gram occurs more frequently in a search result than expected by random chance, there may be a relationship between the n-gram and the search term. For simplicity, we assume terms occur independently and follow Poisson statistics. This defines 1) an expected number of occurrences of any given n-gram in any given search result, and 2) a standard deviation of the random variation in the number of occurrences. If the observed number of occurrences is more than 3 standard deviations greater than expected, the search term and n-gram are unlikely to occur together by random chance. This simple approach has been shown to work by capturing many known relationships. For example, the chance that the n-gram CHD (coronary heart disease) is found by random chance in a search of Heart Attack is out at 160 standard deviations. HOCl-LDL (hypochlorite-oxidized LDL) is at 127 standard deviations, and Heart Disease is at 124. There are typically hundreds of n-grams with significance greater than 50 for broad search terms like the answer types. One drawback is that n-grams are not terms, and often include meaningless strings like risk of heart (part of risk of heart disease and risk of heart attack).</p><p>Using the above approach, Essie can produce a list of related n-grams for a given search term. This capability was used to suggest broader, narrower, and closely related terms for the answer types in the TREC 2007 training topics. Human review finalized these domain query expansions (an example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,368.48,97.43,3.62,9.02" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). The process was tedious and error prone, but possible with less than an hour of human effort per answer type.</p><p>Essie Queries: Past experience has taught us several tricks in creating effective Essie queries. Essie scores documents with a value, P, between zero and one, which can be loosely interpreted as a probability of relevance. An AND search of two terms (A AND B) will require both terms to be present and will score the result document with the joint probability of relevance, PA*PB. A naive approach is to AND together all search terms, but this is extremely restrictive. Documents missing any one of the search terms would be excluded. A finite penalty for missing search terms can be included by ORing in constant background scores. An OR search of two terms (A OR B) will require either term to be present and will score the result document with the probability, PA+PB-PA*PB. Our goal was to find the 1,000 most relevant legal ranges for each topic. Filtering and ranking of these results was performed in the post-processing of retrieval results. Therefore our search strategy was recall-oriented.</p></div>

Plasma sVCAM-1 concentration is significantly elevated in patients with active lupus nephritis of WHO classes III and IV, and is decreased during remission [28, 29]. These results suggest that sVCAM-1 may be a promising marker for monitoring patients with lupus nephritis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">SemRep post-processing</head><p>The goal of this processing was to identify passages containing not only the semantic types of an expected answer and those found in a question, but also the potential exact answers.</p><p>Identification of exact answers was based on the assumption that an answer can be expressed in the form of a relation between a query term and an instantiation of an answer type, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,280.63,176.71,3.74,9.02" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, where the semantic type of the term Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 maps to the answer type PROTEINS, and the term Lupus is found in the query.</p><p>In addition to finding a relation between an answer type and a query term, we needed to define the relation types that potentially answer the questions. As the question types were not explicitly defined in the task, we approximated the question-answering relations using all "interesting" relations for a given answer type, whether the answer type was an object or a subject in a relation. These approximations were based on extensive use of SemRep in genomics, pharmacogenomics, and knowledge discovery <ref type="bibr" coords="6,72.00,360.71,78.08,9.02" target="#b0">(Ahlers et al, 2007)</ref>. See Appendix A for the full list of answer and relation types.</p><p>In SemRep post-processing, each passage was scored based on the full credit given to appropriate relations containing an answer type and a query term, and partial credit given to appropriate relations containing either an answer type or a query term.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Combining evidence from exact answers, semantic filtering and passage relevance</head><p>The additional sources of evidence with respect to relevance of a given passage were sought because we anticipated that many extracted relations will point to approximate answers, and many useful relations are not yet defined in SemRep. For example, it remains to be seen if the judges consider the exact answer to question 200 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,174.37,556.24,5.01,9.02" target="#fig_5">6</ref> relevant, as the question contains an underspecified term that could have several interpretations, and the relation contains a specific disease term. However, expanding the answer to the whole passage we captured another sentence containing a potentially relevant relation between the sera selectins and SLE. Unfortunately, the relation captured by SemRep in this sentence was AFFECTS(Selectins, Disease), which is too general for an exact answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic type filter:</head><p>The semantic type filter checked that the passages retrieved by Essie contain the terms and semantic types mentioned in the query and the expected answer type. Using the training questions we derived a set of semantic types likely corresponding to each answer type (see Appendix 1). For example, the answer to the question "Which MUTATIONS are associated with xxxx" was expected to belong to one of the following semantic types: gene function (genf) or gene/genome (gngm). Sentences were identified in the passages and each sentence was assigned a score based on the coverage of the terms and semantic types mentioned in the query. The coverage was measured by counting the number of unique terms that were common between the query and a sentence. We also checked whether the sentence contained a term with the expected semantic type of the answer. The semantic matching was measured using a modified Jackard similarity measure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,325.38,279.70,213.05,23.71">answers N terms common N Ssize Qsize terms common N sim Sem _ _ _ _ _ _ × ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ - + =</formula><p>where N_common_terms is the number of the query terms that are covered in the sentence, Qsize is the total number of terms in the query, Ssize is the total number of terms in the sentence, and N_answers is the total number of possible answers (terms that have the semantic type of the expected answer) in the sentence. A paragraph could have one or more sentences and we selected the maximum score among all sentences in the paragraph.</p><p>The final score assigned to a passage was a linear combination of the normalized scores assigned to passages during semantic filtering with those generated in SemRep post-processing and assigned by Essie. The scores were normalized as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,325.80,487.63,114.51,33.66">min max min ) ( X X X X X norm - - =</formula><p>Based on the observations of combining the scores for training topics, a slightly higher weight (0.4) was given to scores assigned by SemRep. Equal weights (0.3) were given to the scores generated by the two remaining systems.</p><p>Examining retrieval results for training topics, we determined that, in general, reference sections tend to top the list because they contain all query terms and synonyms; however very few titles were actually relevant to the questions. Given SemRep results, we can pinpoint the relevant titles. Therefore in the final post-processing step, these titles were extracted from the reference sections as described below. The reference sections containing no useful relations were demoted to the bottom of the list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Sub-span computation</head><p>In order to provide a more focused answer than an entire maximal legal span, we attempted to locate the answer sentences within the span. This was made difficult because the sentences had been stripped of special characters and XML syntax that is present in the maximal legal spans. For simplicity we just did an exact substring match for each of the sentences and formed the union of the discovered spans. If the sentence boundaries were not found exactly, we used the entire maximal legal span as the answer.</p></div>

The original topics prepared for Essie queries were used in Terrier retrieval without expansion or any other further processing. For Terrier, the InL2 model was used with its default parameters. The description of Theme and Easy IR follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Theme</head><p>The NCBI contributed a run that was incorporated into the fusion run and also independently submitted through our UMD colleague <ref type="bibr" coords="7,195.31,373.39,68.50,9.02" target="#b4">(Lin et al, 2007)</ref>. The run was based on an updated and simplified "theme query" process that we utilized in previous years.</p><p>To process a query topic, a program scanned the topic text to extract a list of features. For each feature, a probability was assigned to each TREC document, and the product of these feature probabilities was used for the final TREC ranking.</p><p>The TREC collection was processed by indexing on all words and bigrams using an in-house C++ class library that also tokenizes and removes stop words. The indexes enabled efficient retrieval and cross referencing of documents and the words and bigrams.</p><p>The features extracted from each topic consisted of all common nouns and verbs, all bigrams of adjectives and nouns, and the entity type itself (determined by matching the given names). Parts of speech were determined using the MedPost part-ofspeech tagger <ref type="bibr" coords="7,129.25,614.96,71.50,9.02" target="#b16">(Smith et al., 2004</ref>).</p><p>The document score for each feature was determined by query expansion on MEDLINE ® . For terms, i.e. words and bigrams, this was accomplished by querying MEDLINE (with the same indexing software) and using the result set to compute Bayesian weights for all MEDLINE terms. Those MEDLINE terms with weights greater than 9.64 were retained and applied to the TREC collection <ref type="bibr" coords="7,518.86,74.35,21.15,9.02;7,324.00,85.87,72.33,9.02" target="#b8">(Kim and Wilbur, 2005)</ref>. That is, the score for a given term and a given TREC document was obtained by summing the retained Bayesian weights over all of the terms appearing in the TREC document. In a similar way, a score was assigned to each document for each of the 12 given answer types excluding GENES and PROTEINS. For each answer type, a manually-constructed query was performed on MEDLINE, often using MeSH ® headings and subheadings. For example, for the answer type CELL OR TISSUE TYPES, the entire MeSH hierarchy starting at A10 (Tissues) and A11 (Cells) was queried. The resulting set of MEDLINE documents was used to compute Bayesian weights for all possible MEDLINE terms, and these were used in the same way to compute scores for all TREC documents. At this point, the raw scores were set to 0 for those documents that we determined were likely to correspond to whole bibliographies, as these contained a large number of relevant features in unrelated contexts. This included documents with more than 100,000 characters, and documents with more than 2,000 characters also having more than 1 in 15 characters as a period, colon, or digit. The raw scores were then converted to a probability with the formula p = 1 / (1 + exp( a z + b)) where z is the raw score and a and b are chosen separately for each feature so that the top 10 scores received a probability of 0.99 and all documents containing at least one weighted term received a probability of 0.5.</p><p>The answer types GENES and PROTEINS were treated differently. We utilized a system that recognizes sentences containing gene names (following <ref type="bibr" coords="7,369.54,499.88,106.15,9.02" target="#b17">Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002)</ref>, trained on the GENETAG collection <ref type="bibr" coords="7,422.64,511.40,91.63,9.02" target="#b18">(Tanabe et al., 2005)</ref>. The value of the highest scoring sentence in a TREC document was taken as the score of the entire document for both the GENES and PROTEINS entity types. To map these scores to a probability, whole bibliographies were removed as before and the same formula was applied taking a = -1 and b = 10 to achieve a shallow, fuzzy cutoff near a raw score of 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">EasyIR</head><p>Bibliographical sections were a priori removed from the indexed collection, as well as very short text passages (&lt; 12 characters). A subset of the original collection (about 800,000 passages) was selected based on an automatic run generated by Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="7,508.10,683.89,32.12,9.02;7,324.00,695.41,36.34,9.02">(Ruiz et al, 2007)</ref> using the original queries. Porter stemming was applied on this collection with a specific handling of hyphens. Thus, the following 3-word expression a-b-c was expanded into the following set of words {abc, ab, bc, a, b, c}. A specific pivoted normalization (dtu.dtn) weighting formula <ref type="bibr" coords="8,244.79,108.85,43.30,9.02;8,72.00,120.37,38.66,9.02">(Gobeill et al., 2007)</ref> was used at retrieval time with slope = 13. The original DF (document frequency) of the collection was mixed with a DF list computed on the whole MEDLINE collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Adding document relevance</head><p>To find documents potentially containing answers to the test topics, one of the researchers built manual PubMed queries to search MEDLINE. The set of retrieved documents was used to re-order the passage ranks obtained in the fusion run, promoting passages from documents retrieved using PubMed and deemed relevant. This process is illustrated by the query in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,353.36,85.91,3.74,9.02" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, which retrieved two MEDLINE documents that were also in the test collection. Simply by virtue of this retrieval (without examining the full documents) scores for the passages from these two documents that were also retrieved by the Essie search were boosted. For instance, the best-ranked Essie passage 14693703_3813_2415 was boosted from a rank of 34 to a rank of 4. It appears to be relevant to the query based primarily on the sentence, "Caspase-1 is important in the regulation of IFN production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)stimulated secretion of IL-18 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,448.96,212.42,10.98,9.02" target="#b1">(2)</ref>." and the fact that NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice were referenced twice elsewhere in this passage.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>The performance of our base systems was not as uniform as in previous years (see Table <ref type="table" coords="8,255.82,455.82,3.61,9.02" target="#tab_4">1</ref>). The significance in the differences in performance of our runs reported below was measured using Wilcoxon's Signed-rank Test. Focusing on the automatic runs, the fusion run (NLMFusion) significantly outperformed all but the Terrier base run on all evaluation levels. Our knowledge-based run (LHNCBC) did not outperform either its retrieval step (Essie), or the fusion run.</p><p>Although both semantic post-processing steps performed significantly worse than the retrieval results on which they were based, there is no statistically significant difference between the combined run (LHNCBC) and the base run (Essie). Contrary to our expectations, our fusion run significantly outperformed the knowledge-based run on document, aspect and passage levels.</p><p>The exclusion of the reference sections of the full documents did not influence the results significantly. For example, document MAP of the Essie run with references was 0.2311, which is not significantly lower than the run without the references (Table <ref type="table" coords="8,519.54,628.37,3.61,9.02" target="#tab_4">1</ref>).</p><p>Trimming of the passages also did not influence the results: scores for trimmed and untrimmed runs differ in the fourth digit after the decimal point (using both passage MAP metrics).</p><p>Despite the fact that our interactive run (NLMInter) amounted to a limited relevance feedback in the form of a list of documents potentially relevant to the question, its results are significantly better than the underlying fusion run on the document (p &lt; 0.001) and passage levels (p&lt;0.05), but not on the aspect level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Our results suggest that for the tasks requiring identification of passages of text potentially relevant to biomedical questions, pure information retrieval approaches are sufficient. Adding knowledge-based methods (when extraction of entities and relations to answer the question is not required) does not improve the results.</p><p>Although our fusion approach does not significantly outperform one of the contributing base systems this year, it still reliably maintains an acceptable level of performance.</p><p>The improvements in retrieval due to relevance feedback were to be expected. However, it is worth noting that the knowledge about relevance of a document determined by virtue of its retrieval in an expert PubMed search and an examination of its abstract is sufficient to improve passage retrieval.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,208.32,381.96,195.40,9.02"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Span cleaning and parsing example</figDesc></figure>
