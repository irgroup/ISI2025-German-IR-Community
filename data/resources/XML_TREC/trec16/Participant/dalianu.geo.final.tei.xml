<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>TREC 2007 Genomics Track is a modification of the question answering extraction task used in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,357.15,18.92,9.45" target="#b6">2006</ref>, where the answers, in part, are lists of named entities of a given type. The new challenge is how to recognize the named entities and how to combine them into the retrieval model. We use a simple entity-level retrieval method to solve this problem. Fourteen types of entities mentioned in 2007 protocol <ref type="bibr" coords="1,152.16,403.95,12.27,9.45">[1]</ref> are recognized at the preprocessing stage. The entity class name is appended to each named entity as a special token. If terms of a query are concerned with some class name of named entity, the token that represents the entity class is added to the query as a common term and then retrieve the index. Our method for passage retrieval is almost identical to our system at 2006 Genomics Track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,165.29,466.35,11.19,9.45" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, which uses a sentence-level half overlapped sliding window and a linear combination of the passage and paragraph score. We used MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) for query expansion. Indri structure query language model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,335.37,497.55,12.27,9.45" target="#b1">[3]</ref> is used in our two interactive runs (DUTgen1 and DUTgen2). BM25 algorithm is used in the automatic run (DUTgen3).</p><p>The other sections are organized as follow: Section 2 presents the method for named entity recognition. Section 3 describes query expansion and retrieval. Section 4 is the result discussion. Section 5 is the conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Named Entity Recognition</head><p>In this year's task, most works in preprocess are similar to our early work <ref type="bibr" coords="1,405.54,622.35,11.21,9.45" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. In addition, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used in this stage due to the specialty of the new topics.</p><p>NER in biomedical domain has attracted the attention of numerous researchers in resent years. The official evaluation results of JNLPBA <ref type="bibr" coords="1,295.37,669.15,12.28,9.45" target="#b2">[4]</ref> and BioCreative 2004 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.82,669.15,12.28,9.45" target="#b3">[5]</ref> show that the state-of-the-art performances are between 70%-85% varying with different evaluation measures. The general approaches can be categorized into dictionary-based, rule-based and machine learning based methods. Successful systems always combine the three methods to obtain a high overall performance. In this task, fourteen types of named entities are required to recognize. We employ a two-stage method. In the first stage, four types of named entities are recognized using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. The training data is derived from GENIA corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.48,76.35,11.19,9.45" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, where 36 classes of entities are labeled by biologists. In our experiment, we merged the 36 classes into 4, i.e., PROTEINS, GENES, CELL OR TISSUE TYPES and OTHER NAMES. Features are words, N-grams, regular expressions and so on. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,338.23,123.15,5.25,9.45" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the relationship between the original GEINA labels and the four classes. The next stage focuses on the names labeled as OTHER NAMES in the first stage. Dictionary and rule based methods are used to categorize OTHER NAMES into proper classes. For the entity type DISEASES, BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCES and SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS, we search the texts in OTHER NAMES recognized in the previous stage using a dictionary extracted from MeSH. If the term is found in the dictionary, it will be assigned a label of corresponding class. For DRUGS, the dictionary is obtained from http://www.rxlist.com/drugs/alpha_a.htm. For the rest entity types, manual rules are applied to extract names according to the last token of the name or its prefix or suffix. These key words for each class are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,381.84,531.87,3.94,9.45" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Query Expansion and Retrieval</head><p>In the two interactive runs (DUTgen1 and DUTgen2), we pick up all the name entities in topics at beginning, such as disease, gene and other entities. In DUTgen3, noun phrases are extracted automatically using GENIA Tagger [7] and articles (such as "the" and "a") are removed. After obtaining a list of noun phrases, our system expands the phrases into lists of synonyms by searching the MeSH database. We download MeSH files in ASCII format, and program an interface to search any noun phrase. All SY terms in SCR2007 and entry terms in Descriptor Records2007 related to a name entity are considered to be synonyms. These terms are combined with the original name entity to form a preliminary synonym list. We remove anything after the first comma, parenthetical strings and all punctuations.</p><p>The passage retrieval method is similar to our earlier work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,366.59,247.95,11.19,9.45" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, which uses a sentence-level half overlapped sliding window approach. The passage length is also 60. In DUTgen3 we use BM25 algorithm and a linear combination of the passage and paragraph score. In the two interactive runs (DUTgen1 and DUTgen2) queries are constructed manually and interactively by utilizing several of the Indri structured query language operators, such as #syn, #1, #band, #filreq and #combine, which is similar to the work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,278.65,325.95,11.19,9.45" target="#b5">[8]</ref>. For some terms that are selected manually, fuzzy match which is implemented by #uwN operator is applied in DUTgen1. In limited N window all terms must appear within current context in any order. There is an example in topic 212. If you retrieve "#1(insect segmentation)" in Indri, you will get only a few relative documents, but if you input "#uw5 (insect segmentation)", you will get much more relative documents involving "segmentation of insect" or some patterns else. In addition, DUTgen1 uses only the passage ranking, while DUTgen2 uses a linear combination of the paragraph score and passage score, where paragraph retrieval uses BM25 algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,117.17,497.55,5.25,9.45" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the results of the three submitted runs. It can be seen that the performances of the two interactive runs are slightly better than the automatic run in Passage, Passage2 and Document MAP but have a significant improvement in Aspect MAP. The possible reason is that the two interactive runs employ the Indri structure query operators which will bring more "precise" rank than retrieval with separated tokens. When examining the results, we find that the performances for the topics about the entity class PROTEINs, GENEs, and CELL OR TISSUE TYPES are much better than other topics. The performances of NER in these classes are relatively high due to large amount of training data, while for other types simple rules may not work well since we are not biologists. It indicates that NER is an important step in this task. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this year's task, it is difficult to pick up fourteen types of entities mentioned in corpora while all possible methods are applied into this phase. The precision of recognition directly affect that of retrieval in the next phase. Also it is the key phase. If entities are not recognized, much post-process is not helpful. Compared with other teams' approaches, NER is a straight way to solve this year's task, but it is not promising enough for many types if its performance is not guaranteed. Indri structured query language is verified in our experimented of last year's task. Due to its efficiency and effect for specifically key terms, it is applied in this year's task to improve NER's performance.</p><p>Question and answer extraction (passage retrieval) system can give more specific answer to users than document retrieval. However it is a difficult task. In our opinion, the main challenge is how to improve the performance of understanding the meaning of the given sentences or passages, which is just the task of text mining. Retrieval technique based on information of surface words can be used as a preliminary step, but it will not bring significant improvement to this kind of task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,113.40,170.55,385.33,230.49"><head>Table 1 : Relationship between the original GEINA labels and entity classes</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table coords="2,113.40,170.55,385.33,214.29"><row><cell>Class</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>GEINA label</cell></row><row><cell>PROTEINS</cell><cell>protein_subunit,</cell><cell cols="2">protein_substructure,</cell><cell>protein_molecule,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">protein_family_or_group,</cell><cell cols="2">protein_domain_or_region,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">protein_complex, protein_N/A</cell></row><row><cell>GENES</cell><cell>RNA_molecule,</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">RNA_family_or_group,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">RNA_domain_or_region,</cell><cell>RNA_N/A,</cell><cell>DNA_substructure,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>DNA_molecule,</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">DNA_family_or_group,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="3">DNA_domain_or_region, DNA_N/A</cell></row><row><cell>CELL OR TISSUE</cell><cell>cell_type, tissue</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>TYPES</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>OTHER NAMES</cell><cell cols="4">polynucleotide, peptide, other_organic_compound, other_name,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="4">other_artificial_source, nucleotide, multi_cell, mono_cell, lipid,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="4">inorganic, cell_component, carbohydrate, body_part, atom,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">amino_acid_monomer</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
