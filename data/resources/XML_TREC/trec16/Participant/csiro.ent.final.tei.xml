<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The goals of CSIRO's participation in the Enterprise track were formed by the nature of the tasks. With the expert finding search task, we sought to use a variety of means to associate topical expertise with individuals previously located within the collection. With the document search task, we were primarily interested in exploring issues of result diversity based on different characterisations of documents within the collection.</p><p>We completed both expert and document search tasks by the submission deadline. In both cases, we submitted four runs for each task. The algorithms used for the runs for both tasks used a query-only baseline with subsequent variations. In both cases, we incorporated use of the PADRE retrieval system <ref type="bibr" coords="1,409.46,390.42,11.49,11.46" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, in which the Okapi BM25 relevance function was implemented as the core ranking component. Incorporation of additional evidence such as anchor text and other characteristics of Web documents is used in the default ranking formula associated with the retrieval system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Expert search task</head><p>The expert search task was substantially different to prior years in the Enterprise track. First, judgments of (a small list of) who the key contacts were for a topic were made by the science communicators who created the topics in the first instance. Science communicators are people employeed within CSIRO to communicate science to the public. This meant that the task was more oriented towards a system with high early precision than recall. Second, there was no list of candidates provided in advance. Candidate experts were to be identified (somehow) within the corpus, and then reported by email address, as a form of unique id.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Expert search pre-processing</head><p>The first challenge was thus to process the document collection and attempt to discover email addresses from it. Normal CSIRO email addresses for individuals are in the form Firstname.Lastname@csiro.au. However, case formatting of email addresses is inconsistent. And in many cases, email addresses are obfuscated through the use of character encodings for the @ symbol. These alternate forms of email addresses had to be identified, extracted and canonicalised. Subsequently, a reversible mapping of canonical email uids to documents within the collection was made. From the email uids, it was straightforward to generate a set of people's names.</p><p>The corpus was analysed to determine that certain URL patterns corresponded to home pages. The vast majority of these were found as profile pages on www.csiro.au/people/ and www.ict.csiro.au/staff/. A notional sub-corpus was created from these documents -profiles. A standard PADRE index was created over this sub-corpus.</p><p>Another notional sub-corpus -surrogates -was created by querying PADRE over an index of the full corpus with the names of people identified earlier. For each person, a surrogate document corresponding to the PADRE HTML output format for the top 50 results for a query of the form "Firstname Lastname" was generated. e.g. An expert previously identified through the email uid as Peter.Bailey@csiro.au would become a phrase search query "Peter Bailey". It was hoped that the 5-line query-biased summaries generated for each result would contain relevant topical information in close proximity to occurrences of the person's name. Again, a standard PADRE index was created over this sub-corpus.</p><p>Two additional methods involving anchor text were involved. It is known that anchor text is a strong indicator of topical relevance from prior work (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.10,196.26,11.41,11.46" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</p><p>The first -expert anchor terms -calculated tf.idf scores over the anchor texts associated with individual documents found in the full corpus. These documents were ranked according to the summation of these scores over the query terms on a per-topic basis. Then the experts associated with each document were scored correspondingly (for both the expert names and the expert email uids found in association), and summed. Concretely, if a document had anchor text associated with it of "information retrieval", then tf.idf scores for the terms "information" and "retrieval" were calculated, with respect to all anchor text available. Then if an expert name "Peter Bailey" was associated with the document, and the topic query was "information retrieval", the corresponding expert uid Peter.Bailey@csiro.au would receive the sum of the tf.idf scores associated with "information" and "retrieval". If the expert email address Peter.Bailey@csiro.au was also associated with the document, it too would get additional scores. Finally an expert list was reported in score order. Note that this method does not discriminate against partial matches of the query terms.</p><p>The second -expert document match -used PADRE to find exact matches of the query in the anchor text associated with documents. Concretely, if a query consisted of "information retrieval" then those terms must match exactly as a phrase in anchor text associated with a document for it to be included. Then the same process was carried out of mapping documents to experts (and their email uids), with the expert score being calculated on the basis of the frequency of email uids and names in all the documents returned, and the expert list being sorted in score order and reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Expert search runs</head><p>We submitted four runs for expert search, making use of different query input and combining our evidence in different ways. The runs, and a summary of their methods, are given in 1.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,95.38,504.51,5.46,11.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the performance of each run. The baseline run is CSIROesQonly. Adding additional information available in the narrative run CSIROesQnarr improves performance marginally. The two other runs are particularly interesting.</p><p>First, in CSIROesQprof using only the pages available from the profiles dramatically degrades performance. (We believe that the use of the term 'expert' should not substantially affect the results due to PADRE's ranking mechanisms; documents which contain the word 'expert' would have been ranked higher, but if no documents contain the work 'expert' then results would be the same as if the term had not been included in the query to PADRE.) We speculate this poor result arises because insufficient information about "topicality" is available in the profile pages alone; other data in the rest of the corpus is important to help establish expertise.</p><p>Second, in CSIROesQpage, although we use only the surrogates sub-corpus, the additional information of key pages (analogous to a degree to click logs) results in the best performance of all 4 runs we submitted. The modification to the ranking algorithm (shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,299.17,653.55,4.54,11.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) incorporates the key pages nominated by the science communicator for the topic as a way to up-weight the scores of experts for whom those key pages occur in their surrogate documents. This result confirms current research indicating the utility of external evidence for improved ranking performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.09,694.20,11.57,11.46" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but at one level removed in the search task. Further investigation is merited here. As for CSIROesQonly</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CSIROdsQfb Topic query</head><p>The key pages from the topic are used to adjust the weighting assigned to individual categories from the genre and clustering analysis; diversification is the goal CSIROdsQsimp Topic query</p><p>The key pages from the topic are used to adjust the weighting assigned to individual categories, such that pages which are similar to those already chosen are ranked higher</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Document search task</head><p>The document search task was a fairly standard Web search activity. Judging measures for the task are likely to reward successful early identification of key pages. The NDCG metric will be best suited for this task; however, results at the time of this paper are only available for 43 topics, and do not include NDCG.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document search pre-processing</head><p>The system effect we were investigating was variations around the concept of result diversity <ref type="bibr" coords="4,456.24,470.14,11.67,11.46" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,470.36,470.14,7.88,11.46" target="#b0">1]</ref>. We speculated that CSIRO science communicators would prefer a variety of highly relevant documents (e.g. media releases, project pages, reports, profile pages, ...) not simply a straightforward ranked list. We used two kinds of analysis to assist diversification. The first was some genre analysis, carried out in a topic-independent manner. The nature of the CSIRO corpus allowed us to carry out genre identification into a small number of interesting categories (people, projects, media releases, publications, biographies, feature articles, podcasts), using some simple regular expression matches over URLs and document texts. Documents were only allowed to appear in one category. Each category formed a separate pool of documents. Those documents which could not be categorised into any of these categories formed an additional pool of uncategorisable documents.</p><p>The second analysis we used was a proximity-based fuzzy clustering algorithm (PFCM) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,462.74,592.08,11.48,11.46" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This was computed on a topic-dependent basis, over the pool of uncategorisable documents. Each clustering resulted in a new set of pools of documents. Documents were permitted to be in multiple clusters for a single topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Document search runs</head><p>We trialled three combination algorithms for selecting documents from a diversity of categories/clusters, and settled on one we called Algorithm B. This computed a score per document of ∑ i non-zeromembershipo f category(i) rank(i)×globalRank where globalRank is the rank of the document given by PADRE when it runs over the whole corpus. The run CSIROdsQonly performed the best overall of any of the runs. The addition of query terms from the narrative in CSIROdsQnarr noticeably degraded performance for both MRR and MAP. Interestingly, for the runs making use of feedback information (the key pages provided by the science communicators in the topics), the diversity based approach of performed better than selecting for similar pages in CSIROdsQsimp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>For document search, the CSIROdsQonly run making use of only the topic's query information appears to be the most effective technique. The runs making use of the narrative information or the feedback (in the form of the key pages) appear to have hurt both MRR and MAP somewhat. Until the NDCG metric is calculated, it will be difficult to tell if our approach to diversification was successful. MRR results are encouraging, but the goal in this task is really to retrieve a few high value documents early in the list, not just one. The MAP measure does not bode well on this front. Comparison back to a native PADRE ranking would be worthwhile.</p><p>For expert search, the results are encouraging and deserve closer investigation. Additional work to find other sources of external evidence around topical associations to experts could bear fruit in this context.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,76.19,146.39,445.33,314.49"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Indexing and retrieval settings for the expert search task.</figDesc><table coords="3,76.19,163.30,445.33,297.58"><row><cell>Run ID</cell><cell>Indices</cell><cell></cell><cell>Query</cell><cell>Weighting</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CSIROesQonly surrogates,</cell><cell>pro-</cell><cell>Topic query only</cell><cell>A simple weighted combin-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">files, expert anchor</cell><cell></cell><cell>ing algorithm was used, which</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>terms,</cell><cell>expert</cell><cell></cell><cell>summed the normalised scores.</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">document match</cell><cell></cell><cell>The profiles and expert docu-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>ment match scores were given</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>higher weights.</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CSIROesQnarr surrogates,</cell><cell>pro-</cell><cell>Topic query as a phrase,</cell><cell>As for CSIROesQonly</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">files, expert anchor</cell><cell>each query term (manda-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>terms,</cell><cell>expert</cell><cell>tory), and the topic's</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">document match</cell><cell>narrative terms (optional)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>(with stopwords removed</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>from both query and nar-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>rative)</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CSIROesQprof profiles</cell><cell></cell><cell>As for CSIROesQnarr</cell><cell>Normal PADRE weighting</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>plus the addition of the</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>term 'expert'</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CSIROesQpage surrogates</cell><cell></cell><cell>Topic query only</cell><cell>If the topic key page URLs</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>are found in a surrogate docu-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>ment, then PADREscore × (1 +</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>1 rank o f URL in surrogate ); otherwise PADREscore</cell></row></table></figure>
