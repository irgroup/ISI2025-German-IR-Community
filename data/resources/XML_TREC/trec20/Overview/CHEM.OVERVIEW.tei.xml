<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The third year of the Chemical IR evaluation track benefitted from the support of many more people interested in the domain, as shown by the number of co-authors of this overview paper. We continued the two tasks we had before, and introduced a new task focused on chemical image recognition. The objective is to gradually move towards systems really useful to the practitioners, and in chemistry, this involves both text and images. The track had a total of 9 groups participating, submitting a total of 36 runs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Chemical Track of TREC aims to provide professional searchers with an understanding of the limits of the available tools and, at the same time, to stimulate interest from the research community. In organizing this track, we realized that we were in fact addressing two rather distinct research communities, which, although both focus on the chemical domain, do not usually interact. The text mining and image understanding processes are very different, but both of them are essential for the end user, as chemistry heavily relies on non-textual information.</p><p>In this campaign, we started in 2009 with a test, to see how current approaches to IR perform when given a corpus of chemical patents and scientific articles <ref type="bibr" coords="1,455.95,571.67,11.52,9.57" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,471.95,571.67,7.67,9.57" target="#b0">1]</ref>. We observed the limits and in the following year we extended the collection to include more scientific articles and, essential, the accompanying images and structure files for many of them. A large collection, of almost 500GB of compressed text and image data was provided, but no specific task was created to require participants to deal with the image data.</p><p>We realized that handling both types is impossible for any research group, and, at the Chemical IR workshop organized last year at TREC, we decided to have a specific task to handle images. This task would require participants to, given an image file, provide the chemical structure of the compound there depicted. It was the most successful tasks this year, with 5 groups sending in their results.</p><p>2 Prior Art Task (PA)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Topics</head><p>As in the previous year, the effort this year was to create a balanced selection of topics. Of the total 1000 topics (numbered PA-1001 through PA-2000), 334 were from the European Patent Office, 333 from the US Patents and Trademarks Office and 333 from the World IP Organization. The sources were distributed randomly among the 1000 topics. Consequently, of the small set (PA-1001 through PA-1100) there were 20 from the EPO, 37 from the USPTO and 43 from the WIPO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Results</head><p>This year we received runs from two participants for the Prior-Art Task. Their results are described in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,202.93,369.55,4.24,9.57" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Technology Survey Task (TS)</head><p>The TS task is a standard ad-hoc retrieval task where the challenge is to retrieve documents from the collection that can best answer the information need expressed in the topic. This year, the TS task focussed on biomedical and pharmaceutical topics, unlike previous years when it dealt with general chemistry topics. The primary motivation was to investigate the ability of state-of-the-art IR systems to deal with the textual diversity in biomedical patents and full-text articles by handling synonyms, abbreviations, naming variants, and many more. The second motivation is the availability of enormous terminological resources in the biomedical domain (such as MeSH<ref type="foot" coords="2,410.46,521.17,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , UMLS<ref type="foot" coords="2,453.82,521.17,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , ATC <ref type="foot" coords="2,493.69,521.17,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , and many more) and the necessity to investigate their adaptability to support information retrieval from patents and full-texts that has not been systematically tested in the past (according to author's knowledge). Although, the TREC Genomics track focussed on retrieval of biomedical full-text articles, there is a need for common platform-based evaluation of IR systems for patents.</p><p>In order to deal with this challenge, 6 questions concerning the information needs (also called as TS-topics) were provided by domain experts. Altogether, 4 teams sub-   mitted 14 runs for this year's task. Information about the topics can be found in the Appendix. Details of the evaluation and results can be found in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sampling and Relevance Judgement</head><p>We employed the stratified sampling approach for generating a pool of documents for evaluation of each topic following the <ref type="bibr" coords="4,274.71,456.64,11.52,9.57" target="#b2">[3]</ref> method. We took all results returned in the top 10 by any run, 30% of those in the top 30 and 10% of the rest (down to rank 1000).</p><p>As last year, the TS topic evaluation was performed in parallel by junior and senior evaluators. A parallel evaluation is believed to enhance the level of interaction between the evaluators as well as reduce the overall time required for the evaluation process. Senior evaluators designate the patent experts who formulated the TS topics whereas the junior evaluators were graduate students who hold an academic major degree in biotechnology, bioinformatics, or medicine. One junior evaluator and one senior evaluator made judgments for each topic. Therefore, the judges team was composed of 6 junior and 4 senior evaluators each handling strictly one topic. The tool used for the evaluation was ChemAssess<ref type="foot" coords="4,147.41,590.18,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . For a given pooled document set for each topic, a junior evaluator makes a judgement as the document is unjudged, unsure, not relevant, relevant, or highly relevant. The ChemAssess tool does not allow overlapping annotations and therefore each document ends up having only one judgement. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,344.98,632.78,5.45,9.57" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the number of documents contained in pooled document sets for each TS topic. An illustration of the user interface of the ChemAssess tool is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,295.60,659.87,4.24,9.57" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. For every document in the pool, the junior evaluator first decides the relevancy of a document based on his/her personal knowledge. Junior evaluators were facilitated with a set of biomedical terminological resources and databases in order to understand the synonyms and naming conventions of biomedical entities. For example, the junior evaluators referred to Swissprot for protein names, DrugBank for drug names, MeSH and UMLS for medical terms (such as diseases), and KEGG BRITE<ref type="foot" coords="5,423.13,473.60,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_4">5</ref> for various biological entities such as pharmacological terms, pathways, and many more. In case of uncertainty in the decision, junior evaluators had an option to interact with the senior evaluators or track organizers within the ChemAssess environment. Based on the overall comments, the junior evaluators made the final judgement over a document's relevancy to the respective topic. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,238.26,543.29,5.45,9.57" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the number of comments or discussions passed over different TS topics by the evaluators. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,325.43,556.84,5.45,9.57" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the final results of judgement for every TS topic</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Performance Measures</head><p>Performances of the submitted runs were evaluated using the evaluator's judgements as a golden standard. As evaluation metrics, inferred average precision (xinfAP) and the inferred normalized discounted cumulative gain (infNDCG) were applied. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">xinfAP</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="6,101.98,280.35,10.92,9.57" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Yilmaz and colleagues extended the infAP measure by taking non-random samples from the pool of documents. We adopted this measure because it appears to estimate AP more accurately than infAP, given the same evaluation effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">infNDCG</head><p>Also based on a stratified sampling approach, infNDCG extends nDCG, whose aim is to represent the common view that relevant documents returned higher in the ranked list are more important than similarly relevant documents returned lower in the list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results of Technology Survey Task</head><p>This year we received runs from 4 participants (for a total of 14 runs). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,454.78,433.76,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_3">3</ref> describes the results of the evaluation. The figure shows a cummulative plot for each run, where each task is stacked on top of the others. This way, it is easier to observe how each run perfomed for each topic.</p><p>4 Image-to-Structure Task (I2S)</p><p>The main purposes of this task include evaluation of the state of the art in the chemical image recognition field and the applicability of image recognition for information retrieval goals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Topics</head><p>Two sets each containing 1000 images and the corresponding MOL<ref type="foot" coords="6,423.71,608.09,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_5">6</ref> files have been selected to act as a training and an evaluation sets from the USPTO file collection. The following criteria were used in the selection process: • No polymers (brackets in the molecule description), charges or isotopes -judged by the presence of text lines starting with "M" but "M END" in the ctab block of the MOL file.</p><p>• No multi-fragment MOL files, only one molecule per file is allowed.</p><p>• Allow only "organic" elements -C, N, O, S, F, Cl, Br, I, P, and H.</p><p>• Check that ctab records for all atoms correspond to the formal charge of 0 and that the isotope type is unspecified (default).</p><p>• Check that there are no stereobonds with stereo orientation specifically set to "undefined"</p><p>• Check that the number of heavy (non-Hydrogen) atoms is greater than 6, and the molecular weight is lower that 1000 a.u.</p><p>• Check that InChI<ref type="foot" coords="8,200.81,305.43,4.23,6.99" target="#foot_7">7</ref> can be created for the selected molecules.</p><p>These criteria allowed the organizers to focus on small organic molecules for which a reasonably widely accepted and well-defined chemoinformatic identity measure existsnamely InChI and InChI key. Those are also the types of molecules believed to be of the most interest to the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Training set of images and MOL files and the evaluation set of images only have been made available to the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation</head><p>Participatns of the Image2Structure task have been asked to submit the results of their runs in the form of SD files. SD file format is analogous to MOL with the exception that it allows for multiple molecules to be stored in a single file. This difference between the ground truth MOL format and the requested SD format was delebirate to allow for the possibility that recognition software may erroneously generate several output molecules for a single molecule input image. There are many free and commercial software utilities which allow interconversion between alternative formats, such as SMILES  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>This year, the Image-to-Structure task received 11 runs from 5 participants. Overall, results were very good, with all participants recognizing over 60% of the given structure images. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,163.35,538.51,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the results for each run. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,350.42,538.51,5.45,9.57" target="#tab_3">4</ref> connects the names of the runs in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,136.44,552.06,5.45,9.57" target="#fig_4">4</ref> with the participating groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This year it was clear that the Prior Art task had reached its final point. From it, we learned the extent to which we can, in one hit, get relevant documents to a patent application in the chemical domain. We were delighted to see engagement between students and senior evaluators in the Technology Survey task, and, in the following months, look to participants to provide a deep analysis of what worked and what did not work for the bio-chemical domains. We were also happy with the participation in the Image-to-Structure task. After all, there are only a handful of groups who do this professionally, and of all those contacted, only two could not send in results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Appendix</head><p>Topics used in the Technology Survey Task of TREC-CHEM 2011.</p><p>Topic Title Narrative TS-20 Tests for HCG hormone</p><p>The hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) is produced when a women becomes pregnant. Tests are usually carried out by analysing blood or urine. We are looking for articles and patents on these pregnancy test kits or the chemical tests used to produce them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TS-22 Uses of hormones in detection of menopause</head><p>The onset of menopause in women is complex and often difficult to detect accurately. We are looking for methods, devices, or kits using the fertility hormones Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for detection of the menopause in women. TS-28 D-ala-D-ala ligase inhibitors D-ala-D-ala ligase is a well known antibacterial target and the idea is to find potent inhibitors of this bacterial enzyme which have the ability to kill bacteria. Getting the additional MICs data (usually as tables in the body of a patent) is very important. TS-29 Inhibitors for acetylcholinesterase Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is a potential target for Alzheimer's disease so identifying potent inhibitors of this human enzyme may lead to new treatments of this devastating disease TS-33 Respiratory tract disorders treatment using inhalation of porous particles containing hydrophobic amino acid and endogenous phospholipids Find patents that claim use of porous inhalation particles that contain a hydrophobic amino acid (e.g. leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, etc.) and endogenous phospholipid(s) (e.g. phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, etc.) for treatment of respiratory tract disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TS-37 DNA-based asymmetric catalysis</head><p>The users are looking for information about DNA-based asymmetric catalysis, especially sample reactions that have been done so far.

The runs were evaluated based on a recall measure by matching of the standard InChI keys computed from the original MOL file and the SD file representing recognition software output. Chemical identity is often a subject of ongoing debates among chemists about what constitutes a unique molecule. InChI -IUPAC International Chemical Identifier -is a text representation of a molecule which was designed to compute normalized, canonical text string from the original molecule representation. InChI takes into account certain forms of tautomerism, stereochemistry, etc. InChI key is a hashed version of InChI. Standard InChIs and InChI keys, while not completely free of their share of issues, are widely used as unique chemical identifiers by chemists worldwide.
