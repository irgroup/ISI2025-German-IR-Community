<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Session Track was introduced at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2010. The Session Track aims to evaluate the ability of search engines to utilise previous user interactions in order to provide better results for subsequent queries in a user session and therefore 'point the way' to what the user is actually looking for. Last year participants were given query sessions containing only two queries and no interaction data. This year the session track provided more interactive data to the participants. Query sessions were collected from real users and contained a variable number of queries and interaction data such as the documents displayed to the user, the clicked documented and dwelling times.</p><p>This year the session track was another opportunity to explore different adaptive modelling techniques to improve retrieval over query sessions. The wider context is the Au-toAdapt project 1 which looks at automatically building and adapting domain models from the users' search and browsing behaviour (using query logs). These domain models are used to assist users to find information by suggesting query modification or browsing suggestions in their search.</p><p>We submitted three runs based on two adaptive models. The first of these is Nootropia, a biologically inspired adaptive modelling technique that has been successfully applied to Information Filtering (IF) problems such as news recommendation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,363.38,222.69,13.50,7.86" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. We used Nootropia to adapt a profile of information needs throughout the session and exploited the profile in the retrieval process for the last query. Two different strategies were used to build the adapted profile. The first models what the user is interested in and conversely the second models what the user is not interested in.</p><p>The second approach is an extension of our anchor log expansion technique we proposed in the previous year. We exploit the anchor logs to derive query expansions that are relevant to user information needs throughout the session. Anchor text has shown to be effective for a variety of information retrieval tasks. This includes ad-hoc search and the diversity task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,375.35,348.22,9.20,7.86" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,391.55,348.22,9.20,7.86" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Anchor text can be considered as a replacement to user queries as often web authors use similar labels to describe web pages to those used by searchers to find them <ref type="bibr" coords="1,371.84,379.61,9.20,7.86" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Moreover, Dang and Croft have recently shown how anchor text can be used to simulate user sessions. They have considered all the anchor text pointing to the same document as queries in the same user session <ref type="bibr" coords="1,543.65,410.99,9.20,7.86" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. We derived query expansions from the anchor logs by either using anchor logs as simulation of query logs to derive related terms or phrases that represent the user information needs in the session or by using an implicit relevance feedback model that exploits the anchor text of the displayed or clicked documents throughout the session.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief description of the task introduced this year. We describe the dataset and the resources used in our runs in Section 3. We explain the experiments and the runs submitted to TREC in Section 4. The results of those runs are then discussed in Section 5. Finally we give a brief conclusion in Section 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE TASK</head><p>The main difference in this year's task compared to the last year is that more interactive data is provided to the participants.</p><p>Participants have been provided with a set of query sessions. Each session consists of the current query qm and the query session prior to the current query: (a) the set of past queries in the session q1, q2, ..., qm-1.</p><p>(b) the ranked list of URLs for each past query, (c) the set of clicked URLs/snippets and the time spent by the user reading the corresponding to each clicked url web page.</p><p>Participants then run their retrieval system over the current query,</p><p>• ignoring the session prior to this query (RL1).</p><p>• considering only the item (a) above, i.e. the queries prior to the current query (RL2).</p><p>• considering only the items (a) and (b) above, i.e. the queries prior to the current along with the ranked lists of URLs and the corresponding web pages (RL3).</p><p>• considering only the items (a), (b) and (c) above, i.e the queries prior to the current, the ranked lists of URLs and the corresponding web pages and the clicked URLs and the time spent on the corresponding web pages (RL4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</head><p>The ClueWeb09 dataset<ref type="foot" coords="2,160.82,250.62,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_0">2</ref> is a web crawl of more than a billion pages that has been used in last year's Web track. The ClueWeb09 category B dataset is a subset of the larger ClueWeb09 crawl and it consists of 50 million English pages. In this year's task participants were permitted to use either one of the two datasets. An existing Indri<ref type="foot" coords="2,233.89,302.93,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_1">3</ref> index of the ClueWeb09 dataset is already available and searchable via a public web service <ref type="foot" coords="2,135.76,323.85,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . The web service would enable us to issue queries and retrieve the top documents returned by the search engine, thus removing the burden of indexing the data internally. The Indri search engine uses language modelling probabilities and supports query expansion. The anchor log for the dataset has been processed and made publicly available by the University of Twente<ref type="foot" coords="2,242.85,386.61,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . Each line in the log represents a document in the collection with all the anchor text pointing to the document <ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.91,409.30,9.21,7.86" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. We used the anchor log file of the ClueWeb09 Category B dataset. This file contains 43 million lines and thus contains anchor text for about 87% of the documents. Each line is tab separated and consists of the document TREC identifier, its url and all the anchor text pointing to that document.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,95.67,472.07,4.61,7.86">1</ref> shows a sample line in the anchor log file. We add quotation marks to group anchor text fields for illustration purposes. In the next sections describing our runs, we will use the following terminology. For a query q consisting of a number of terms qti, our reference search engine (The Indri search engine) would return a ranked list of documents using the query likelihood model from the ClueWeb09 category B dataset: Dq dq,1, dq,2, ..., dq,n where dq,i refers to the document ranked i for the query q based on the reference search engine's standard ranking function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RUNS</head><p>As a group participating in the session track we can submit three different runs to TREC. Each run consists of the four lists RL1, RL2, RL3, and RL4.</p><p>In all the runs we will generate RL1 by simply submitting a preprocessed version of the current query q m to the Indri index, i.e. RL1 will be equivalent to D q m . The current query qm was processed to produce q m following these steps:</p><p>1. Removing the following punctuation marks ( ) , ? 2. Removing stop words from a common list of English stop words that do not fall within quoted text 3. Replacing quotes with the corresponding Indri syntax #1(&lt;quoted text&gt;) e.g. "event planning" becomes #1(event planning)</p><p>4. Replacing site specification with the corresponding Indri format, e.g. "female winemakers site:.com.au" becomes "female winemakers com.url au.url"</p><p>The maximum number of returned documents in the list is limited to 1000. We also used the Waterloo Spam Rankings<ref type="foot" coords="2,551.77,255.00,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_4">6</ref> for the ClueWeb09 dataset to filter the spam documents from the returned ranked lists. We consider documents with scores of 70% or less as spam which is recommended by the creators of those rankings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.39,298.61,9.20,7.86" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Generating RL2 would be a similar task of generating RL3 in the previous year's task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,426.12,319.53,9.20,7.86" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. In our runs we will generate RL2 in different ways.</p><p>The major challenge resides in generating RL3 and RL4. In the following we propose a couple of methods to generate those lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Nootropia to model query sessions</head><p>Nootropia is a biologically inspired Information Filtering system that has been used successfully in news recommendation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.43,414.34,13.49,7.86" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</p><p>With Nootropia, information needs are represented as a weighted and ordered network that may represent an individual's multiple topics of interest. This network profile presentation can evaluate the relevance of an information item to the user interests based on a directed spreading activation model. Nodes (features) in the network that appear in the item are activated and subsequently disseminate part of their initial energy to nodes with larger weight. At the end of this feedforward dissemination process, a single relevance score can be calculated as the weighted sum of the final energies of activated terms.</p><p>The proposed process of using Nootropia to generate RL3 and RL4 is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,449.66,550.33,3.58,7.86">2</ref>. Throughout the session we take the documents that have been displayed to the user by the search engine to create a Nootropia model. For the current query qm, we submit the preprocessed version q m , as explained before, to the search engine and then we use the profile built so far in a form of a Nootropia network to give a score to the returned documents reflecting how much they match the profile. The scores can be used to re-rank the documents. We will use two routes to re-rank the documents using the Nootropia profile and therefore we propose two different runs:  we take an "optimistic" approach and consider displayed documents as useful documents to the user. The documents that match this profile should be promoted. Therefore we rank the documents returned by the search engine for the current query by their Nootropia score in an descending order and that would be our RL3.</p><p>Let N a be the Nootropia profile for all displayed documents to the user. Let SNa (d) be the matching score of a document d in the profile N a . RL3 = d1, d2, .., dn ; ∀i</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,76.21,458.46,216.69,18.32">: di ∈ D q m ∧ SNa (di) ≥ SNa (di+1)</formula><p>For RL4, we take only the clicked documents to build a profile of user interests unlike the previous profile.</p><p>Let N + be the Nootropia profile for all clicked documents by the user. Let S N + (d) be the matching score of a document d in the profile N + . RL4 = d1, d2, .., dn ; ∀i</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,76.21,558.67,216.69,19.69">: di ∈ D q m ∧ S N + (di) ≥ S N + (di+1)</formula><p>• Nootropia Negative (essexNooNeg): Here we take a "pessimistic" approach and consider the displayed documents not useful to the user as they had to reformulate the query and therefore any document that matches this profile should be penalised. Therefore we rank the documents returned by the search engine for the current query by their Nootropia score in an ascending order and that would be our RL3.</p><p>Let N a be the Nootropia profile for all displayed documents to the user. Let SNa (d) be the matching score of a document d in the profile N a . RL3 = d1, d2, .., dn ; ∀i</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,339.23,332.37,216.69,18.32">: di ∈ D q m ∧ SNa (di) ≤ SNa (di+1)</formula><p>As for RL4, we take only the documents not clicked on to build a profile of documents that the user is not interested in. The documents that match this profile should be penalised. Therefore, we rank the documents returned by the search engine for the current query by their Nootropia score in an ascending order and that would be our RL4.</p><p>Let N -be the Nootropia profile for all abandoned documents by the user. Let S N -(d) be the matching score of a document d in the profile N -. RL4 = d1, d2, .., dn ; ∀i</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,339.23,477.16,216.69,19.69">: di ∈ D q m ∧ S N -(di) ≤ S N -(di+1)</formula><p>To update the profile, we should feed the document or a representation of the document to the Nootropia model. For this we extracted all the nouns and noun phrases in the snippet of the document. For the detection of noun phrases we look for particular patterns of sequence of partof-speech tags based on the algorithm for the detection of terminological terms as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,465.06,565.39,9.20,7.86">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In both runs, to generate RL2 we use a similar approach to the one used in our baseline system last year (i.e. 'es-sex1') where we used the previous history of the user by simply submitting both queries in the session. Therefore, to generate RL2 for both Nootropia runs we simply submit a query which consist of the first query and the last query in the session q1, qm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Expansion with anchor text (essexAnchor)</head><p>The second approach we propose here can be seen as an extension to our anchor log technique proposed in the previous year <ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.61,690.26,9.20,7.86" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p><p>To generate RL2 we use a similar approach to the one used in our anchor log system last year ('essex3'). We consider the first query and the last query in the session q1, qm and use the same method described in our last year's paper <ref type="bibr" coords="4,283.19,68.10,9.72,7.86" target="#b1">[1]</ref> to generate query expansions from the anchor log to the reformulated query qm.</p><p>For RL3 and RL4, we use a relevance feedback approach by expanding the query with the anchor text of displayed or clicked documents respectively.</p><p># combine( 0.7 # qm 0.3 # combine( w 1 #e 1 w 2 #e 2 .. w 10 #e 10 ) )</p><p>wi is the normalised frequency of the anchor text across the documents.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,98.38,194.03,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_1">1</ref> we give an example of the expansions extracted to generate queries for RL3, RL4 for session 63.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULTS</head><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,92.29,240.75,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,118.99,240.75,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_3">3</ref> summarise the results for our three runs as well as the maximum and median for all the session track participants. This year NIST assessors provided relevance assessments on two different criteria thus the results in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,53.80,282.59,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_2">2</ref> take into account all the subtopics, whereas the results in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,79.12,293.05,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_3">3</ref> only reflect the user's last subtopic.</p><p>Each of the table columns represent the normalised discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) for each result list submitted, despite receiving a variety of relevance metrics we will focus our results analysis on the nDCG results, as they relate to the established metrics from last year's competition. The tables are split in two, the top half using the nDCG metric for all the documents submitted and the bottom showing the nDCG score using only the first ten returned documents (nDCG@10).</p><p>The arrows in the RL2, RL3 and RL4 columns represent the relative improvement or decline in the nDCG scores between the results lists for a given system (row), with a double (⇑) arrow indicating that a two tailed t-test has supported the result as significant. For instance an upward arrow (↑) in the RL2 column indicates that RL2 improves on RL1, and the first and second arrows in the RL3 column compare RL3 to RL1 and RL3 to RL2 respectively. These results are also charted without significance test data in the graphs in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,83.27,491.81,3.58,7.86" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The following subsections outline the results obtained for each system, in cases where we do not explicitly refer to a result as significant it can be assumed that the comparison has returned a t-test value p &gt; 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Expansion with Anchor Text</head><p>Taking all the subtopics (Table <ref type="table" coords="4,187.92,554.27,4.09,7.86" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) we see that the retrieval performance of RL2 is worse than RL1 when looking at all retrieved documents, but conversely the nDCG@10 score does improve i.e. the top results improve. This is in line with last year's results where expansions using association rules from query logs simulated from anchor logs improved performance. However, using only the last subtopic RL2 performs worse than RL1 on both nDCG and nDCG@10.</p><p>Comparing RL3 to RL1 demonstrates significant improvement in all cases i.e. when using the last subtopic, all the subtopics and against nDCG and nDCG@10. Therefore the implicit relevance feedback from anchor text of retrieved documents does improve the retrieval performance.</p><p>RL4 also shows improvement relative to RL1 in all cases, however it is only significant when using all subtopics. RL3 is marginally better than RL4 in all cases though in general the difference is so small as to consider them on par. Thus using the anchor text only from clicked documents to expand queries does not appear to improve performance.</p><p>Relevance scores for our non-baseline submissions (RL3 and RL4) are between median and maximum of the composite scores for the track and when using nDCG@10, their performance is very close to maximum and well above median results reported. In fact 'essexAnchor' was the top performing system among all the participants when it comes to nDCG@10 for RL3 using all subtopics. The anchor text approach performs better when assessed over all the subtopics than when measured against only the last topic, which is not surprising as this method tries to model user interest throughout the session and does not only target a specific subtopic of a query. Note that this correlates with the overall maximum and median scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Nootropia</head><p>When assessing all subtopics RL2 is significantly better than RL1 for both nDCG and nDCG@10. RL2 combines the user's first and last query and it was used as our baseline in last year's session track The results here are in line with last year where this baseline has shown to be capable of improving the retrieval performance over an adhoc system. However considering only the last subtopic, RL2 improves on RL1 for nDCG but is worse for nDCG@10.</p><p>Comparing the relevance scores for RL3 and RL4 to RL1 shows performance declines when using Nootropia Positive using either evaluation strategies and in some case the difference is significant. While RL3 and RL4 both show a similar downward trend in comparison with RL1, only considering the clicked documents in RL4 does improve on RL3. Like our anchor test method the retrieval performance using all sub-topics is better than just using the final subtopic, this follows the general trend seen in the summary results provided by NIST i.e. the maximum and median scores illustrated in tables 2 and 3.</p><p>The results for the Nootropia Negative run (RL3 and RL4), show that the "pessimistic" approach performs significantly worse than our baselines (RL1 and RL2) across all metrics. In addition using the click data (RL4) results in a further decline in retrieval performance. Comparing the results for Nootropia Negative (both RL3 and RL4) to Nootropia Positive we see that Nootropia Positive performs significantly better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>The session track in TREC 2011 provided a framework for testing retrieval systems over query sessions where previous queries and interactions with the search engine can be utilised in the retrieval process.</p><p>As in the previous year, we show that the anchor log of the document collection is a valuable resource that can be useful in the session retrieval problem. In the last year's task, previous queries in the session were useful to derive query expansions for reformulated queries from the anchor log to improve the retrieval performance. This finding was supported by the results this year, and in addition to that, with interaction data the retrieval performance is further enhanced by using the relevance feedback from the anchor text of retrieved documents. This approach achieved the best retrieval performance for RL3 among all participating systems in the track.   We also show how an adaptive IF system can be employed for the session retrieval problem using two different strategies. For the proposed setup, no improvement was observed using either strategies. However with the reusable dataset and relevance judgements provided by NIST we will conduct more experiments where we develop the approach presented here in applying this adaptive model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,200.01,116.80,209.71,7.89"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A sample line in the anchor log file</figDesc></figure>
