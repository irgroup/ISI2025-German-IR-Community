<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">I ntroduction</head><p>The goal of the Legal Track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) is to assess the ability of information retrieval techniques to meet the needs of the legal profession for tools and methods capable of helping with the retrieval of electronic business records, principally for use as evidence in civil litigation. In the USA, this problem is referred to as "e-discovery." The 2011 Task uses exactly the same dataset as the 2010 Learning Task, which is the set of documents that results from message-level du-duping of the Enron emails. The collection is consisted of 685,592 e-mail messages and attachments (approximately 4GB of text) from 159 mailbox directories. The Learning Task of the Legal Track investigated the effectiveness of e-Discovery search techniques at learning from examples to estimate the likelihood of responsiveness as a probability of relevance of every document in a collection. In addition, the 2011 Task uses three new requests for production, which is named Topic 401, Topic 402 and Topic 403, respectively. Each topic included a one-sentence request for documents to produce for each topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">I ndexing</head><p>In the Learning Task, we are provided thousands of documents for each topic. To index the collection, we processed the files as follows:</p><p>We converted the message text edrmv2txt-v2 to an XML form. For each message (including attachments), DOC the document, we used sssssn the message as a mail or an attachment. If we got an attachment edrmv2nativeattach , we used the es of the message were demonstrated, and the details of each document were any line of the body of the email. The reason for converting the collection to this XML format was that we could then index it with building the indri.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Query</head><p>We used the method of relevant feedback to query experiment results with the combination of indri theory, which could reflect the probability of relevance of every document quite well.</p><p>First of all, we constructed query conditions according to the content of three requests of the production. We extracted key words showed as follows:</p><p>Topic 401: &lt;text&gt;#scoreif(enrononline #combine(#1(on line service) #combine(design development operation marketing) #combine(purchase sale trading exchange) #1(financial instruments) #1(financial products) #combine(#1 (derivative instruments) commodities futures swaps #1(common stock) equity dollars)))&lt;/text&gt; Topic 402: &lt;text&gt;#scoreif(#band({rule regulation law standard proscription act} {Enron Enrononline} {testimony evidence witness exhibit}) #combine(legal illegal permitted prohibited act testimony evidence exhibit witness proof commission {purchase sale trading invest exchange transaction})) &lt;/text&gt; Topic 403: &lt;text&gt;#scoreif(environment #combine(#1(environmental impact) #combine(#5(take measure) governing) #combine (emmissions spills pollution noise #3(animal habitats) leaking discharge) Enron #band(environmental {standards rule regulation law proscription}) #combine(#1(conform to) #1(comply with) avoid circumvent influence) ))&lt;/text&gt;</p><p>We chose top 100 in the experiment results as the most relevant ones to submit, and then we got responsiveness determinations from the TA.</p><p>Secondly, in order to finish the experiment more effective, we design the query sentences with the theory of relevant feedback. We applied VSM in inquires and reconstruction of documents based on the former determinations from the TA. We thought there were similarities between VSM of the different labeled relevant documents, and the diversities of the VSM existing in the labeled irrelevant ones. Therefore, the kernel idea of the method was the inquire values of the reconstruction should be closed to the VSM of the relevant documents as much as possible.</p><p>Supposed the collection of the relevant documents as r C , in this situation, the best inquire vector value to distinguish the relevant and irrelevant documents expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,211.03,96.37,171.63,30.60">1 1 j r j r j j opt d C d C r r q d d C N C</formula><p>Finally, we got the opt q values of the words form each of the documents which could be positive or negative. We chose the word with the biggest positive value as the query key words, and deny the query results relating to the words with the smallest negative value. With this method, we submitted our experiment results with the web interface.</p></div>		</body>
