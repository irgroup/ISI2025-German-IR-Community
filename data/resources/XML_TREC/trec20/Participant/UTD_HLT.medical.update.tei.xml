<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The 2011 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Medical Records Track evaluates the effectiveness of providing content-based retrieval for electronic medical records (EMRs). Participants were given a set of EMRs from the University of Pittsburgh BLU-Lab NLP Repository<ref type="foot" coords="1,162.96,529.64,3.97,4.85" target="#foot_0">1</ref> as well as a mapping between hospital visits and medical records. Additionally, we have been provided with a set of sample topics. These topics are based on a list of "priority areas" created by the Institute of Medicine (CCERP and Institute of Medicine). Each topic targets certain cohorts -groups of people sharing a common attribute -and is designed to find a population over which comparative effectiveness studies can be done. Examples of topics used for training are provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="1,99.36,650.01,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The goal of this track is to return a ranked list of hospital visits that satisfy the requirements expressed in each topic. A hospital visit is a set of electronic medical records that pertain to a single patient's visit to the hospital. As each hospital visit contains multiple EMRs (as many as 415), producing a ranked list of hospital visits is much more complicated than retrieving a ranked list of individual documents when using a query as complex as a topic. Moreover, hospital visits may consist of multiple types of EMRs, e.g. an operating room report, multiple radiology reports, a discharge summary, and other reports detailing physical findings, plans of treatments, descriptions of the patient's problem, or laboratory test results. In a hospital visit, many EMRs are generated for a patient, but only a few of them may be relevant to the topic of interest. Because of this, the content-based retrieval system that we built for this evaluation operates at the hospital visit level instead of the EMR level.</p><p>Given the wealth of medical information that is currently available, we incorporate medical information from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We also rely on the knowledge encoded in PubMed Central and Wikipedia. These forms of knowledge greatly contribute to our system.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of our approach to this task and Section 3 explains how we extract keywords from a given topic. Section 4 expresses our methods for extracting additional requirements from the topic, with sub-sections detailing each type of requirement. Section 5 provides a discussion on our methods for expanding the keywords we extracted while Section 6 illustrates our three methods of retrieving and ranking relevant hospital visits. Section 7 outlines how we filter our initial list of hospital visits based on our extracted topic requirements. Finally, Section 8 provides an evaluation of the performance of each of our four submissions, Section 9 offers a discussion on ours results, and we conclude our paper with Section 10 by reviewing the task and our approach, and by looking to the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Architecture</head><p>Our approach converts each topic into a machinereadable query. These queries are generated by extracting all keywords that capture the essential requirements of each topic. The keywords extracted from the provided sample topics are given in bold in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,111.37,640.77,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Many of the topics expressed additional requirements such as age restrictions (e.g. elderly patients, patients younger than 30 ), gender restrictions (e.g. male patients, women), keyword negations (e.g. not diagnosed with schizophrenia) or disjunctive keywords (e.g. diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar depression). After keywords have been ex-tracted, any of these additional requirements present in the topic are detected and incorporated within the topic's associated query.</p><p>The medical records used for this task vary significantly in terminology when discussing any given keyword. For example, the keyword atypical antipsychotics appears in only three medical records. Thus, it is not enough to merely find documents that contain the detected keywords themselves; rather, we must expand each keyword to include other words that denote the same idea: synonyms, hyponyms, and alternate phrasings and spellings. To this end, we expand each keyword using information contained in the UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.51,528.09,86.21,9.96" target="#b1">(Bodenreider, 2004)</ref> and SNOMED <ref type="bibr" coords="2,362.05,540.09,91.12,9.96" target="#b8">(Stearns et al., 2001</ref>) medical terminology databases, as well as information from Wikipedia and the PubMed Central Open Access Subset.</p><p>Unlike query formation, our approach to retrieval, scoring, and filtering varies slightly between our four submissions. Our first two submissions use the Apache Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="2,381.60,616.89,144.17,9.96" target="#b7">(Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2005)</ref> information retrieval system: we created a Lucene index for the provided medical records, and each query is converted into a Lucene-understandable format for retrieval. Our last two submissions also use the Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.37,676.65,107.69,9.96" target="#b9">(Strohman et al., 2004)</ref> language model-based search engine in conjunction with Lucene. To resolve the problem of retrieving visits (sets of medical records corresponding to a single patient's hospital 2. Not start with one of eleven invalid start words (provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,182.38,137.64,3.57,8.97" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>3. Not contain one of thirty-two medical stop words (provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,208.78,163.56,3.57,8.97" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</p><p>4.

Our queries are processed and ranked by the given retrieval system(s). We then re-rank and filter these preliminary results to ensure that any additional, non-keyword requirements -age, gender, and negation -are taken into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Keyword Extraction</head><p>Because each topic targets a specific cohort, a group of people satisfying certain conditions, we must convert these conditions into a machine-readable format.</p><p>To do this, we first extract all keywords -sequences of terms indicating the major concepts or conditions -from the topic. Using the OpenNLP<ref type="foot" coords="3,237.24,431.01,3.97,4.85" target="#foot_1">2</ref> phrase chunker, each extracted noun phrase is scanned for keywords.</p><p>The longest sequences of words within each noun phrase that correspond to the title of an existing Wikipedia article and match the conditions given in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,104.41,504.09,4.98,9.96">2</ref> are taken as keywords. For example, the noun phrase N P = lower extremity chronic wound does not correspond to an existing Wikipedia article. However, the subsequences of that phrase, s 1 = lower extremity and s 2 = chronic wound are both titles of Wikipedia articles. Thus, a topic containing the noun phrase N P will have the keywords lower extremity and chronic wound extracted.</p><p>Because the presence of a noun phrase in a topic nearly always indicates a condition of the cohort in question, we use a secondary method for detecting keywords if our Wikipedia-based approach found a any her the some to their every this all his  none. Because in English the head of a noun-phrase is typically the right-most word, we take the longest sub-sequence ending in the right-most word that satisfies the conditions in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,444.98,400.77,4.98,9.96">2</ref> as a keyword. Any keyword detected in either of these two methods is assumed to represent a requirement upon the cohort targeted in the topic. Any visit considered relevant must contain occurrences of all required keywords. Unfortunately, not all conditions are expressed in noun phrases, and not all noun phrases are properly detected. To address this, we examine each word in the topic which was not used as part of a keyword to determine if it should be used as an optional, or non-required keyword. Any word that satisfies the keyword conditions in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,482.31,533.25,4.98,9.96">2</ref> and the additional, stricter requirement that the word may not occur more than 10,000 times in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset is taken as a non-required keyword. These optional keywords capture additional constraints not detected in noun phrases of the topics, but are too noisy to be considered as requirements. Thus, optional keywords are used merely as indicators of potential relevance: visits that contain mentions of an optional keyword are more likely to be more relevant than those that do not, however the absence of an optional keyword does not prevent a visit from being relevant. For example, in the topic patients admitted with new-onset diabetes, diabetes is detected a required keyword, but new-onset is detected an optional keyword.</p><p>Although many of the requirements expressed in the training topics were captured by the keywords we extracted, some topics required additional requirements, such as age restrictions (e.g. teenagers who have taken or plan to take Plan B ) and gender restrictions (e.g. men with prostate cancer treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Consequently, we devised a requirement distillation method that captures these additional and important characteristics of the topics.</p><p>Additionally, topics included disjunctions or negations that are ignored by the keyword extraction technique that we developed. To address this limitation, we have developed four distinct methods for recognizing topic requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Extraction of Patient Age Requirements</head><p>Topics such as elderly patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia or patients in their 20s and 30s admitted for overdose pose an additional requirement: hospital visits returned should focus on patients whose age lies within a certain range. These age restrictions are extracted with the following grammar:</p><p>&lt;age-phrase&gt;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,82.68,420.33,214.27,84.72">::= &lt;unqualified-prefix&gt;&lt;num&gt;&lt;age-qualifier&gt; | &lt;qualified-prefix&gt;&lt;num&gt; | &lt;num&gt;&lt;age-qualifier&gt;&lt;unqualified-suffix&gt; | &lt;num&gt;&lt;qualified-suffix&gt; | &lt;range-prefix&gt;&lt;num&gt;&lt;range-infix&gt;&lt;num&gt; | &lt;known-age-entity&gt;</formula><p>Where a &lt;num&gt; entity captures both English and numeric representations of ages, and a &lt;known-age-entity&gt; is one of a few dozen manually created classes with known age ranges, such as elderly (ages 60 or older), children (aged 2 to 12), or adult (aged 20 or older).</p><p>To ensure the captured &lt;num&gt; describes an age, and not a range of some other, arbitrary domain, each rule requires either a qualified prefix or suffix, or an age qualifier. For example, the sequence patients younger than 30 contains the qualified prefix younger than denoting that the captured number, 30, is a description of age. The sequence patients of at most 30, by contrast, must be followed by an age qualifier such as years to establish that the captured range denotes an age range, and not, say, a BMI (body mass index) range. If an age range is found, the age requirements are stored as part of the query. Additionally, if any keyword extracted for this topic conveys the same patient requirements as the extracted age range (e.g. the keyword children), the keyword is discarded because the age requirement already conveys this restriction more directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Extraction of Patient Gender Requirements</head><p>In addition to patient age requirements, some topics expressed gender requirements upon targeted patients. For example, the topic men with prostate cancer treated with surgery imposes the requirement that all returned hospital visits pertain to male patients. We extract such genders requirements using simple regular expressions that search for an occurrence of one of 17 gender-indicating words created for both genders (e.g. words that indicate the male gender are man, men, boy, he, etc.). If a gender word is detected in a topic, the gender requirement is stored in the query. If more than one gender was detected in a topic (i.e. if both the words women or men occur), the associated query is assumed to have no gender requirements. As with age requirement extraction, keywords that indicate redundant patient traits to the extracted gender are removed. Thus, the possible gender requirements are 'male', 'female', or 'either'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Detection of Negations</head><p>Many topics use negation; thus, the scope of negation needs to be detected so that keywords that were extracted from within a negation scope can be negated as well. We check for any negations upon our extracted keywords. For example, the topic patients with cancer not treated with surgery, requires that all corresponding patients were not treated with surgery. Such negations within the topic are detected, for the first three runs, using the NegEx regular expression system which is based on regular expressions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.00,555.69,101.28,9.96" target="#b3">(Chapman et al., 2001)</ref>. The fourth run uses the LingScope system and is described in Section 6.2.2 of this paper. Both systems output negation "scopes" which are word sequences from the topic that contain negated terms. Each topic is processed for negations by comparing each extracted keyword to each negation scope. Any keyword found within a negation scope is marked as negated keyword in the query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Detection of Disjunctions</head><p>Because the topics are expressed in natural language, syntactic complexities arise. One such complexity is encompassed by co-ordinated disjunctions, After processing for keyword negations, we check for disjunctions within the topic, such as surgery or radiotherapy. We detect these keyword disjunctions using the Stanford Dependency Parser <ref type="bibr" coords="5,214.83,110.37,84.01,9.96;5,72.00,122.37,22.31,9.96" target="#b5">(De Marneffe et al., 2006)</ref>. This is accomplished by analyzing the dependency parse for any conjunction dependencies with the word "or", denoted as conj or in the annotations. If a disjunction is found, any keywords corresponding to either disjunctive dependency is marked as a disjunctive keyword. Each disjunctive keyword is stored along with its disjunctive set: the set of other keywords that form a disjunction with the keyword. For example, given the topic men with prostate cancer treated with surgery or radiotherapy, both surgery and radiotherapy would be marked as disjunctive keywords, and each would record the disjunctive set {surgery, radiotherapy}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Query Expansion</head><p>In written text, and especially in medical records, the morphology of words varies significantly both between and within documents. In order to account for these variations in text, we store each extracted keyword in several forms. All queries internally store up to six variations of each keyword: its originally detected form, a WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="5,189.61,377.73,69.16,9.96" target="#b6">(Fellbaum, 1998</ref>) lemmatized form, an unabbreviated form (based on a list of common medical abbreviations), a form in which hyphens are padded with spaces, a form with all hyphens replaced with spaces, and a form with all punctuation removed. These forms are used as synonyms for the purposes of keyword expansion, negation filtering, and retrieval. These slight variations in morphology are not enough to capture the diverse ways in which keywords may be expressed in medical records. Indeed, the topics presented in this task often require extensive domain knowledge within the field of medicine in order for some keywords to be properly understood. For example, a keyword such as hearing loss may be referred to as hearing impairment, hard of hearing, decreased hearing, or difficulty hearing. These synonyms all denote hearing loss, but use alternate phrasings. Unfortunately, some keywords are often represented with more than synonyms. For example, the keyword atypical antipsychotics almost never occurs in any of the medical records. Instead, hyponyms (more specific words) such as zoloft, seroquel, or abilify are used instead. In our approach, we consider all of these semantically related words as 'expansions', and we refer to the process of generating them as keyword or query expansion. In addition generating these expansions, we also assign weights, or confidences, for each expansion based on intuition regarding the nature of the resource used. Future work may find more value in automatically setting (or learning) these weights, but due to limitations in both time and training data, our weights were decidedly manually.</p><p>After each expansion phase, keywords are analyzed to ensure that each expanded term is only retained for at most one keyword. For example, if, both atrial fibrillation and ablation contain heart as a synonym, it would be retained as an expansion only for the keyword which has it with the highest weight. This ensures that no keyword may eclipse another keyword with its expansions. Additionally, any keyword which expands into another keyword's original form (unexpanded form) is merged with that keyword, because both keywords are assumed to be direct synonyms. For example, the topic women who are currently pregnant and have been smoking and/or drinking during the pregnancy, contains the keywords pregnant and pregnancy, which both contain each other in their expanded terms. Thus, both pregnancy and pregnant would be merged into a single keyword that contains the union of each keyword's expanded terms and forms.</p><p>We expand each keyword with using four techniques, which are explained in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">UMLS Expansion</head><p>The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a resource for coordinating health and medical vocabularies. UMLS contains three major components: the "Metathesaurus" (which includes data from SNOMED, RxNorm, MeSH, and other collections), the "Semantic Network" which provides general categories and relationships, and the "SPE-CIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools"<ref type="foot" coords="5,477.24,505.53,3.97,4.85" target="#foot_5">5</ref> . Our system uses the UMLS Metathesaurus to generate high confidence synonyms: each keyword is expanded to include all concepts in the Metathesaurus which share the same UMLS concept ID as the keyword (an abridged example is provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,496.11,566.25,3.88,9.96" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Each expansion added by UMLS expansion is assigned a weight of 12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Wikipedia Redirect Expansion</head><p>Wikipedia is a common resource for natural language processing tasks. The English version is comprised of 3,731,340 user-generated articles covering almost any notable topic<ref type="foot" coords="5,387.00,661.89,3.97,4.85" target="#foot_6">6</ref> . In addition to articles, Wikipedia also contains pages called redirects which do not con- tain content themselves, but rather redirect -sendthe reader to another article (or section of an article). Redirects typically embody alternate names, spellings, forms, closely related words, alternately punctuated or encoded forms, less specific forms in which the redirected name is the primary topic, or more specific forms of some other page. Our system uses Wikipedia redirects<ref type="foot" coords="6,177.00,348.33,3.97,4.85" target="#foot_7">7</ref> to generate synonyms, and alternate (or mis-) spellings for keywords. We do this by expanding each keyword so that it includes all article titles that redirect (send the user) to the same article as the keyword. Any expansions added this way are assigned a weight of 10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Co-occurrence Expansion</head><p>Because all keywords may not have clear synonyms or hyponyms, our final method of expansion finds related terms for each keyword. We use these related words as a fall-back so that if a keyword lacks helpful expansions from the previous techniques, we may at least find documents that share similar context with our keywords. The keyword lower extremity, for example, does not have any hyponyms in UMLS. Fortunately, our co-occurrence expansion approach generates many words that, while not direct synonyms or hyponyms, strongly imply the context of a lower extremity. For lower extremity, our approach generates expansions including ankle, amputation, tibial (related to the shinbone), popliteal (related to the hollow at the back of the knee), thigh, and toe. We generate these expansions by calculating the semantic similarity between n-grams (up to size 2) and the keyword and picking the most similar n-grams. We measure this semantic similarity using the normalized Google distance <ref type="bibr" coords="7,93.29,86.49,125.97,9.96" target="#b4">(Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="7,80.16,109.29,209.19,23.52">N GD(k, t) = max (log o(k), log o(t)) -log c(k, t) log N -min (log o(k), log o(t))</formula><p>Where k represents the given keyword, t represents an n-gram, and o(x) is a function providing the number of documents containing term x, c(k, t) is a function yielding the number of documents containing both keyword k and term t, and N is the number of documents in the collection. An N GD of zero denotes terms that always appear together while infinity denotes terms that never appear together <ref type="bibr" coords="7,276.14,228.81,18.87,9.96;7,72.00,240.81,104.66,9.96" target="#b4">(Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>While N GD was originally created to operate on hit counts returned from the Google search engine, our occurrence (and co-occurrence) information is based on the PubMed Central Open Access Subset, a small portion of articles in PubMed Central available under a Creative Commons license, henceforth simply refereed to as PMC 10 . PMC consists of full-text biomedical and life sciences journal literature from the United States National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine. The version of this corpus we used contains 234,591 documents. We calculate the occurrences for each term as the number of PMC documents that contain the term; likewise, we calculate the co-occurrences of terms x and y as the number of documents that contain both terms x and y. For each keyword, k, we rank every n-gram (term), t, seen in the corpus based on the score N GD(k, t). From that ranking, the most similar m k terms are retained as expansions of keyword k.</p><p>Because N GD provides a distance between all words that occur in the same document as any keyword, we must create an upper bound on the number of these words we used.

This formula was chosen after inspecting ranked NGD expansions for several keywords from the training topics. m k expresses our observation that more common keywords often had a greater number of useful expansions.</p><p>Finally, we give a weight, w k to each expansion 10 The PMC Open Access Subset is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/.</p><p>based on its N GD similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="7,361.44,92.12,129.51,25.71">w k (t) = 1.0 -N GD(k, t) z η</formula><p>Where z is the observed upper bound for NGD similarity and η exaggerates the differences between high and low NGD scores (we set η = 5). This adjustment accounts for our experience that that the usefulness of these expansions diminishes quickly when N GD &gt; 0.30 and that terms within a distance of 0.075 are typically inflected forms of the keyword and thus highly related. w k emphasizes the importance of highly related terms while diminishing the weight of terms with have a further distance. 6 Relevant Visit Retrieval</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Lucene-based Approaches</head><p>Our first two submissions both use Apache Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="7,313.20,488.97,148.25,9.96" target="#b7">(Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2005)</ref> as their information retrieval system. Reports are indexed at a visitlevel -that is, all records are merged into a single document for each hospital visit. Retrieval is done by converting each keyword into a Lucene Boolean query of keyword forms and expansions, boosted according to their weights. In both approaches, all Lucene scores are normalized by setting each score to the ratio of that score to the highest score for the query so that the top-ranking visit has a score of 1.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Standard Lucene Approach</head><p>Our first run (UTDHLTSL) uses standard Lucene scoring, which calculates the cosine-distance between each visit and the given query vector. In this run, each question is converted into a Lucene query containing each required keyword's sub-query as a required clause. In this way, a document's score is equal to the sum of its scores for each keyword's subquery.</p><p>This has the effect of allowing documents which have a high score for one keyword and a very low score for another to outweigh documents that have a moderate score for both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2">Multiple Keyword Focused Lucene Approach</head><p>Our second run (UTDHLTMK) attempts to mitigate the ability for a single keyword to eclipse the scores for other required keywords by splitting each query into separate queries for each keyword, and combining the scores for each of these sub-queries in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="8,103.92,252.45,163.12,63.84">score(q, d) = k∈R Lucene(query(k), d) × k∈R Lucene(query(k), d) + |R|</formula><p>Where score(q, d) is the score for document d relative to query q, R is the set of keywords found in both q and d, Lucene(x, d) is Lucene's score for query x and document d, and query(k) is the Lucene query for keyword k. This has the effect of partitioning the results into tiers based how many keywords were matched in each document, represented by the significand, while the fractional portion represents the strength of all occurring keywords within that document. The product of sub-queries provides a stronger indicator of the relevance for all keywords than the sum, as the score depends more closely on each keyword's score. However, because Lucene is indexing visits which are actually sets of (often diverse) documents, document length is rarely reflective of a visit's relevance to a given query. As a result, visits containing very few reports tend to have much higher scores. To that end, the sum and product of the scores for each sub-query are combined to lessen the significant effect of a document's length on its relevance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Hybrid Approaches</head><p>Our last two runs use a combination of Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="8,72.00,616.89,101.09,9.96" target="#b9">(Strohman et al., 2004)</ref> and the two previously mentioned Lucene approaches to score documents. Scoring is done by a weighted vote between each system, with the weights provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,225.99,652.77,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_7">8</ref>. These weights are based on our intuition and scaled to normalize scores between systems. When processed by Indri, each query is represented as a weighted query combining the scores for all keywords, where each keyword is represented as a weighted synonym list. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Hybrid Approach</head><p>Our third run (UTDHLTCIR) is our hybrid approach, based on Indri and both Lucene approaches, that uses NegEx to classify negations like our previous runs. This run mainly exists to provide comparisons between our second and fourth runs: to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach to the Lucene approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Hybrid Approach with LingScope</head><p>Our final run (UTDHLTCIRLS) uses the hybrid approach but uses LingScope <ref type="bibr" coords="8,456.14,326.73,83.79,9.96;8,313.20,338.73,24.04,9.96" target="#b0">(Agarwal and Yu, 2010)</ref> 11 to detect negations and hedging within the documents. LingScope uses a Conditional Random Field trained on the BioScope <ref type="bibr" coords="8,447.86,362.61,92.44,9.96" target="#b10">(Szarvas et al., 2008)</ref> corpus of medical and clinical texts with annotated negations and speculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Result Filtering</head><p>After retrieval, results are filtered through three stages. First, documents are filtered to ensure that they satisfy any age requirements. This is accomplished by parsing the de-identified age information from each visit's reports and lowering the score for any visit that has more occurrences of de-identified ages outside its required range than within its required range. Next, if the query contains a gender requirement, visits are filtered to ensure that the reports associated with that visit contain more occurrences of words indicating the required gender than the opposing gender. Lastly, results are processed for negations. A visit is filtered if, for any required, non-negated keyword, more than one-third of the keyword's occurrences are negated (in the case of run 4, each hedged occurrence is counted as half of a negative occurrence). Likewise, a visit is also filtered if, for any required, negated keyword, less than one-third of the keyword's occurrences are negated (again, in the case of run 4, negated occurrences include hedged occurrences as half an occurrence). 8 Performance Evaluation  <ref type="bibr" coords="9,201.71,425.04,96.99,8.97;9,72.00,435.96,20.34,8.97" target="#b2">(Buckley and Voorhees, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>can be used to compare our submissions against each other, it is more prudent to compare our systems against those of the other groups. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,254.79,485.37,4.98,9.96">3</ref> contains the binary preference scores for our second submission -the multi-keyword Lucene approach -to the best and median scores from all systems for each topic. It can be seen that our system generally performs between the top scoring system and the median.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,109.44,569.01,10.02,9.96" target="#tab_0">10</ref> lists the effectiveness of each component in our system on relevance compared to that of our hybrid approach. Because only a small number of questions involved negation, age, or gender filtering, the effects of these components on our system is inconclusive. However, the effects of query expansion are clear: expanding keywords significantly improves the relevance of returned documents. Because all query expansion methods overlap (each provides a subset of the expansions generated by the other techniques), it is difficult to judge techniques individually. Despite this, it is clear that expansions based on co-occurrence information succeeded in locating documents which discuss relevant concepts. The results also suggest that SNOMED relations, UMLS, and Wikipedia provide essentially the same effects, and that future systems should be able to include any one of these techniques for comparable results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Analysis</head><p>The problem of finding hospital visits corresponding to given patient cohorts, in principle, equates to finding sets of medical records centering on patients whom satisfy the traits of the given cohort. The subproblem of determining the relevance of each set of records requires extensive knowledge of the medical domain. We attempted to bridge this knowledge gap by using query expansion. Unfortunately, in some cases our expanded terms were too general and captured non-relevant records, and in other cases our terms were not general enough and caused us to miss records we should have considered relevant. Topics twenty four and twenty five are particularly interesting in terms of potential improvements in that although we performed near the median, our performance was significantly lower than that of the highest performing system.</p><p>Our results for topic twenty four, Patients who present to the hospital with episodes of acute loss of vision secondary to glaucoma, are significantly damaged by incorrect keyword extraction. Rather than extracting the Wikipedia article title loss of vision, we extract acute loss and vision separately because OpenNLP splits the noun phrase on either side of the preposition of. Because the majority of Wikipedia article titles are noun phrases and because no automatic system has perfect accuracy, we could likely improve our results by scanning the entire topic for Wikipedia articles, rather than only scanning the topic's noun phrases.</p><p>Topic twenty five, Patients co-infected with Hepatitis C and HIV, presents a different problem. The "gold"-judged visits for that topic do not contain any discussion of Hepatitis C nor HIV. Instead, the gold visits contain ICD-9 codes indicative of Hepatitis C and HIV in their discharge diagnosis field of their records. Although these records themselves contain no relevant discussion, the patient that they are associated to still satisfies the traits of the targeted cohort. This illustrates a subtlety in the task that we had not anticipated: rather than looking for visits that are relevant to the traits of the topic, we must instead ensure that the patient discussed satisfies the topic. Converting the keywords for each topic into their associated ICD-9 codes would have allowed our system address this subtlety by returning documents that lack keyword mentions.</p><p>In addition to these improvements, now that more training data is available, future implementations would likely find value in learning or inferring many of the parameters we set by intuition. Parameters of particular note are the weights for each level and rank of query expansion, and the threshold (ratio) used to reject visits containing too many incorrectly negated keyword occurrences as well as the weight of each hedged occurrence. Additionally, utilizing the section of an occurrence of a keyword would allow a system to assign more weight to related sections (e.g. "discharge summary") and less weight to potentially unrelated sections ("family history"). Likewise, this would allow a system to restrict the scope of a keyword to the relevant sections if one were actually looking for occurrences within a patient's family history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusions</head><p>The Medical Records Track was introduced in the 2011 Text REtrieval Conference. This track tackles the problem of collecting hospital visits that correspond to the traits of a given patient cohort. This gives rise to several difficulties: using collections of hospital records as the unit of response, working with highly complex medical texts for which each term requires a high degree of domain knowledge to comprehend, and the lack of training data imposed by the fact that is the first iteration of this track.</p><p>To participate in this task, our approach first extracts the requisite traits from each topic's cohort through keyword extraction, and then gender and age requirement extraction. Next, to bridge the domain knowledge gap, we expand each keyword through the UMLS and SNOMED medical databases, Wikipedia redirect information, and cooccurrence data gleaned from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. Once we have expanded all of our keywords for a topic, we use the Lucene information retrieval engine (as well as Indri in two of our submissions) to initially rank our relevant visits. Finally, we prune these visits using age, gender, an negation filters.</p><p>Our results were promising: our best submission achieved a Mean Average Precision of of 40.8% and all of our submissions perform above the median for nearly all topics.</p><p>For future improvement, we plan to incorporate more medical-domain knowledge, such as ICD-9 codes, as well as using the judgements from this task to learn weights for our various parameters (query expansion weights, negation ratios, etc.) as well as incorporating section information in assessing the value of a keyword occurrence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,210.12,331.80,191.84,8.97;2,72.00,72.08,468.22,244.48"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Architecture of Cohort Shepherd</figDesc><graphic coords="2,72.00,72.08,468.22,244.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
