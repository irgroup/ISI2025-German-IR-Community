<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>This report discusses the collaborative work of the ErasmusMC, University of Twente, and the University of Amsterdam on the TREC 2011 Medical track. Here, the task is to retrieve patient visits from the University of Pittsburgh NLP Repository for 35 topics. The repository consists of 101,711 patient reports, and a patient visit was recorded in one or more reports.</p><p>Because the training set provided by the track organization was small and not made available until quite late in the competition, we decided to create a small training set ourselves. Not only did this allow us to test several ideas before submitting runs to TREC, it also led to several insights into the data. One finding was that synonyms are widely used. Query expansion was therefore deemed essential to achieve a reasonable performance. Query expansion has been used before in Information Retrieval (IR), and is often divided into statistical and knowledge-based query expansion. Statistical query expansion uses data derived from the corpus itself, and a well-known example is pseudo-relevance feedback <ref type="bibr" coords="1,461.62,373.63,11.79,9.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In contrast, we investigated knowledge-based query expansion, which uses a knowledge base such as an ontology or a dictionary to find related terms. This type of query expansion has not always proven to be successful. For instance, Hersh et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,166.82,417.31,12.80,9.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref> found a decrease in overall search performance when using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,193.94,431.85,12.91,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to find related terms. Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,346.15,431.85,12.91,9.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref> found slight improvements with scenario-specific expansion strategies using UMLS. In a previous TREC track, we also found reduced performance when using concept based query expansion <ref type="bibr" coords="1,323.57,460.89,11.81,9.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, but found slightly improved results when using an approach combining concepts with a statistical model of related words <ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.63,475.53,11.70,9.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Similarly, Zhou <ref type="bibr" coords="1,515.38,475.53,12.91,9.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found promising results when using combination of both the original words in the text and the synonyms found for concepts in the text.</p><p>An often-used resource for knowledge-based query expansion in the biomedical domain is the UMLS. However, initial explorations indicated that there is only limited overlap between terms used in topics and medical records and terms found in the UMLS. The main reason for this appears to be that the UMLS is mainly constructed from vocabularies used in classifying clinical data, but not intended to be used in textmining. Terms in the UMLS tend to be more specific than what a physician would use in free-text reporting. For instance, a physician might use the term "upper endoscopy", but this term is not found in the UMLS. Instead, the term "upper GI endoscopy" is found. We have therefore explored a different source of synonyms: Wikipedia. We expected Wikipedia to have a better coverage of the terms encountered in medical records.</p><p>In the following section the construction of the training set is discussed in detail, followed by a description of our system, and an overview of its performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Construction of a training corpus</head><p>Epidemiologists at the Erasmus University Medical Center were asked to name several topics relating diseases to treatments representing interesting epidemiological research questions that could be investigated using hospital medical records. Five topics were generated, and these were combined with the example topic provided by the TREC organization (topic 0) as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,435.96,190.00,4.14,9.94">1</ref>. For each topic, the original query was manually expanded with terms proposed by the epidemiologists in an effort to maximize recall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID Query</head><p>Manual query expansion 0 gastroesophageal reflux disease AND upper endoscopy Table <ref type="table" coords="2,101.78,640.20,4.14,9.94">1</ref>. Set of topics created in collaboration with epidemiologists. The manual query expansion was performed to include as many synonyms as possible.</p><p>A Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.86,679.20,12.91,9.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref> instance containing the reports in the corpus was created. Using the UMLS, ICD-9 codes in the admit_diagnosis and discharge_diagnosis fields were expanded with their text label before indexation by Lucene to allow reports to be found on these ICD-9 codes. For each manually expanded query a set of reports was retrieved using Lucene. For topics 0, 4, and 5, the top 100 ranking reports were used for further analysis. Topics 1, 2, and 3 returned only 45, 70, and 64 reports respectively, and all these reports were used. The reports were manually classified as Relevent, Irrelevant, or Questionable. Questionable reports were removed from the set, and were not condidered in any of the subsequent analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons learned during manual classification</head><p>The manual classification of records was in itself an informative exercise, providing several insights into the data:</p><p> Synonyms are commonly used. For instance, a topic might refer to "upper endoscopy", but most physicians will use the abbreviation "EGD" instead.  ICD-9 codes were found to be uninformative and appear to be used only to indicate what was screened for during a procedure, rather than indicate a final diagnosis. For example, in report19244.xml the ICD-9 code 530.81 (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease) is included in the discharge_diagnosis field, but the report states that "The esophagus was normal… There was no evidence of stricture, inflammation or ulcers," which is in direct contradiction with the finding of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Some sections are more informative than others; we found that sections labeled "postoperative diagnosis" are the most reliable source for locating diseases.  A topic might mention a drug class, such as all NSAIDs, but reports will often mention only an individual drug belonging to the class, such as Aspirin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information retrieval methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprocessing corpus</head><p>The text in the original reports was chopped into lines with a maximum length, probably to accommodate display in the hospital information system. This splitting had to be undone to form complete sentences, which was needed by some of our text processing. First, the number of characters at which sentences were cut off had to be identified, and this cutoff varied per record (67-80 characters). The maximum line length in a report after correcting for insertion of tags by anonymizing was used as the cutoff length for that report. If a line plus the first word in the next line exceeded this cutoff length, this was assumed to indicate that splitting had taken place, and the lines were concatenated.</p><p>Next, the text was split into sentences. For this the OpenNLP sentence boundary detection algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,517.06,559.29,12.91,9.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was used.</p><p>A simple spelling correction algorithm was applied to the text: Two sets of words were extracted from the corpus. The first set consisted of probably correctly spelled words, containing all words that either appeared frequently in the corpus (n &gt;= 50), or were found in a vocabulary of known words, either directly or after lemmatization. The vocabulary of known words comprised all words in UMLS (2010AB) and Wordnet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.90,656.52,16.99,9.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The second set consisted of probably misspelled words, which were words that appeared infrequently (n &lt; 50) and were not found in the vocabulary of known words. Misspelled words were mapped to correctly spelled words if the Levenshtein distance equaled one. If multiple candidate correct words were found, the most frequent word was taken. Examples of mappings are: "fragnents" (n = 1) to "fragments" (n = 2,279), "stenosispresent" (n = 1) to "stenosis present" (n = 12,110), and "possiblity" (n = 16) to "possibility" (n = 3,282). In total, 10,252 words were corrected in the corpus.</p><p>The ConText algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,178.58,113.56,18.43,9.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref> was used to identify parts of sentences that were negated (e.g. "rule out pneumonia") , referred to someone else than the patient (e.g. "family history of pneumonia"), or occurred in the past (e.g. "past history of pneumonia"). ConText is a simple algorithm, similar to the NegEx algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,117.50,157.12,16.99,9.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, that uses trigger terms and simple rules to determine whether a part of a sentence belongs to one of the three categories mentioned above. For example, the trigger term "rule out" indicates that the remainder of the sentence is negated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Section detection</head><p>A simple rule-based system was used to split the report into sections. In a first pass the report is scanned line-by-line to detect the start and endings of a section. In a second pass additional section starts and ends are added to make sure the sections do not nest or overlap. Where possible a label is assigned to the section. The rules to detect the start and endings of sections were manually created based on an analysis of a representative sample from the collection, i.e. containing examples of different report types.</p><p>Typically, a line consisting of a sequence of uppercase letters, optionally followed by a colon, marked the start of a section. In some reports the actual content was written in uppercase letters as well. A number of heuristics (for instance, too many words in the title, the existence of an explicit line end such as a question mark or period, or the start of the line looking like an enumeration) were used to prevent flagging these lines as section starts. Lines containing only series of hyphens were used to detect section ends.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,99.86,510.21,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the 15 most frequently extracted section titles from the report collection.</p><p>Even though non of the sections could be completely ignored, there were some sections that provided stronger evidence for the relevance of search terms, and some sections where a mention of a search term were considered less informative. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,156.67,622.08,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the manually created list of strong and weak section headers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprocessing queries</head><p>The sample topics provided by the TREC organization showed that the format of topics was not a clean boolean query as used in our own training set. Instead, full natural language sentences were provided such as "Patients taking atypical antipsychotics without a diagnosis schizophrenia or bipolar depression". Non-relevant terms in the query were identified as either belong to a small list of predetermined stop words (all stopwords used in MEDLINE plus "patients", "who", "or", "admission", "discharge", "hospital"), or were part of either a verb phrase or prepositional phrase as identified using the shallow parsing algorithm of the OpenNLP toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="5,72.02,147.16,11.79,9.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Parts of queries that were identified by the NegEx algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="5,358.51,147.16,18.43,9.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as being negated were considered to be required not be present in relevant documents. However, negations did neither appear in our own training set, nor in the TREC test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finding synonyms using Wikipedia</head><p>Wikipedia provides a rich and extensive source of information, not only in terms of content but also more structural information, such as the hyperlinks between articles. Besides the general domain, the amount and quality of medical information in Wikipedia also continues to grow. For our current work, we leverage the anchor texts of incoming hyperlinks to Wikipedia articles, including not only "normal" hyperlinks, but also redirects and alternative titles of pages. In particular we calculate the link probability of an anchor text as well as the prior probability for a given anchor text with respect to an article. The former is a function of an n-gram and determines the probability that it can be a link to a Wikipedia article. The latter is a function of an n-gram and an article and indicates the probability that the n-gram is used as a textual representation for that article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finding synonyms and hyponyms using Drugbank and UMLS</head><p>Initial investigation of using Wikipedia to relate drug classes to individual drugs showed that it is not trivial to detect such hierarchical relationships accurately in the Wikipedia source files. Instead, a combination of UMLS and DrugBank <ref type="bibr" coords="5,242.09,405.91,18.43,9.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref> was used. DrugBank is an extensive and accurate repository of drug names and synonyms, but it does not contain a structured representation of drug classes. DrugBank entries were mapped to UMLS concepts using exact string matching of drug names, and parent concepts were identified using the "is-a" relationship in the UMLS. Names and synonyms of the parent concepts were extracted from the UMLS.</p><p>If a query contained the name of a drug class, the query was expanded with the synonyms found for that drug class, and the names and synonyms of all the drugs in the class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic Query Modeling</head><p>Query likelihood (QL) determines the probability that a document generated the query and ranks the documents accordingly. We use a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) on the query and calculate QL according to the KL-divergence of the MLE query and each document language model. SQM builds upon this by updating the query model using information derived from Wikipedia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic Query Modeling using Wikipedia</head><p>We implemented a novel algorithm that uses anchor information in a principled fashion. It does so in two steps. First, the anchor texts are used to identify and score relevant Wikipedia articles for all possible term n-grams in a query. Then, for each of these articles, we again use the incoming anchor texts. In this step, however, we use them to determine the parameters of a language model for each article. The language models are subsequently combined for all n-grams in the query, yielding as end result a semantically-informed language model of the query, i.e., a semantic query model (SQM). For retrieval we use a standard KL-divergence approach, with Bayesian smoothing using a Dirchlet prior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Match score maximization</head><p>One potential problem of query expansion is that some aspects of the query are expanded with many synonyms, whereas other aspects are expanded only with a few or none. This can create an imbalance in aspect representation (query drift) when matching a query to documents. One solution to this problem is to allow each part of a query to be linked to at most one term in a document. When a query part can be linked, for instance through expansion with synonyms, to many terms in the document, the term giving the maximum partial matching score is selected. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,103.55,462.81,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of query terms after expansion, how these terms relate to parts of the original query. The original query terms are also maintained. If, for instance, a document was matched to the query because it contained the term "egd", no additional score would be added to the match score if the term "upper" was also found in the document.</p><p>A term could be matched to a document in four ways: exact matching indicates all words in the term were found in the correct order with no words in between. Sentence, section and report matching indicates all words were found, but separately, within a single sentence, section or report, respectively. Term and document frequencies for each type of matching were calculated separately.</p><p>The partial matching score for each query term was calculated using the Okapi BM25 model  [14], with two modifications: First, a very large bonus (1,000,000) was added to the score for every character of the query linked to the matched term. For example, in figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,395.36,88.96,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, if the term "egd" was found, 15 characters of the query would be linked, adding 15,000,000 to the score. The purpose of this was to give priority to documents that matched a larger portion of the query, and is in line with earlier observations that IR systems tend to fail because not all aspects of a topic are present in the returned documents <ref type="bibr" coords="7,122.54,147.16,16.90,9.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Second, the term frequency is weighted by term characteristics, using the algorithm shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,146.39,161.68,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The algorithm in figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,177.79,186.28,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_1">2</ref> has several parameters that needed to be selected. Also, for the Okapi model there are the b and k parameters. These parameters were optimized using a crude broad search on the training set. The optimal values are shown in figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,301.77,215.32,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and the optimal values for b and k are 0.75 and 2, respectively. The performance did not vary much with the selection of parameters: the minimum MAP encountered was 0.74.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Runs</head><p>Several matching algorithms were tested, each one using the preprocessing steps described in this paper. All algorithms searched for relevant reports instead of visits, and the matching score for a visit was calculated as the maximum matching score of the reports belonging to that visit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lucene baseline (baselucene)</head><p>As a baseline, a Lucene instance was created with the default Lucene settings. Parts of sentences identified by the ConText algorithm as being negated, being related to someone other than the patient, or referring to the past were held out from the index. Information on the section headers was not used. In this baseline run, no query expansion was applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lucene with query expansion (explucene)</head><p>A second run utilized the same Lucene instance as the baseline run, but queries were expanded using both Wikipedia and the DrugBank-UMLS combination. Synonyms from Wikipedia were added if the term was a Wikipedia redirect or the anchor text of an incoming hyperlink that occurs at least five times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SQM (SQM)</head><p>This run uses the same collection preprocessing steps as the "Lucene with query expansion" run and performs retrieval using the SQM method defined above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Match score maximization (WWOCorrect)</head><p>This run uses the same collection preprocessing steps as the "Lucene with query expansion" run and performs retrieval using the "Match Score Maximization" method defined above. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,99.86,298.03,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the results of the various matching strategies on our own training set. In contrast to the official tests, these evaluations were performed at the report level, not at the visit level. The results indicate that a combination of query expansion and ConText filtering improves performance, and that the match score maximization is able to achieve the highest score. One should keep in mind that the system was developed based on this training set, and that results are probably positively biased.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="8,99.86,380.71,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the official results on the TREC test data. None of the advanced matching strategies is significantly better than the Lucene baseline run using ConText filtering (based on a one-sided paired sample t-test, p &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, the Lucene baseline significantly outperforms SQM and match score maximization at P10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Although the results on the training data looked promising, the official evaluation shows that knowledgebased query expansion remains problematic. The use of Wikipedia instead of more traditional knowledge resources appears not to give a robust improvement in search performance.</p><p>The filtering of parts of sentences that are negated, refer to someone other than the patient, or refer to historical events, gives a higher performance on the training set when combined with either manual or automatic query expansion. However, we did not include a run in the official test where this filtering was not applied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,104.42,413.71,381.43,9.94;6,104.42,428.14,399.10,10.05;6,104.42,442.77,107.56,9.94;6,104.35,230.85,386.45,168.45"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
