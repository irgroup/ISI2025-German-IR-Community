<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>TREC has been a key venue in testing and evaluating IR systems against comprehensive and realistic test collections. Medical TREC has kicked off for the first time this year <ref type="foot" coords="1,462.84,387.44,3.97,6.38" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Prior to Medical TREC, IR community had a minimal access to clinical data, however, medical context had more popularity amongst the Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers. Plenty of IR techniques that have been tested successfully in general IR on large collections such as clueweb and legal track, are yet to be evaluated on the medical dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,366.84,436.80,10.01,9.13" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>RMIT submitted four distinct runs to Medical TREC three of which were used for pooling and therefore judged. In this paper we outline the methods and experiments performed and report the final results. Prior to the release of final results we performed our own manual judgments and produced a preliminary evaluation table outlined in this paper. We conclude the paper by showing a comparison table of RMIT's best run with the arithmetic mean of median and the best submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Analysis of the Collection</head><p>Approximately 100,000 clinical reports an aggregation of overall 17,000 individual visits were gathered during the year 2007 from the U.S hospitals and used for Medical track. The collection is fairly small comparing to Clueweb and other well known IR collections but yet it is the biggest existing medical/clinical test collection.</p><p>We started off by parsing and analysing the collection to gain familiarity with the structure of the collection and to identify salient as well as non informative chunks of the text. We found the reports to be fairly dense in terms of the vocabulary used in comparison to the rich vocabulary used in medical/clinical papers. Also in contrast to our pre-assumption reports do not show spelling mistakes, saving a huge amount of data cleansing.</p><p>However, to this end, we are not sure about the existence of semantic mistakes such as assigning a wrong medical code to a patient's report. International Codes/Concepts for Diseases (ICD) could be located in two sections of the text: discharge and admit diagnosis, however, these codes needed to be mapped into textual descriptions in order to match the language of the topics.</p><p>Using simple pattern matching we extracted section headings and identified segments pertaining to different population and age groups. We found that 12,006 reports had one visit associated while 2,387 of the reports had more than or equal to 10 visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Relevance Judgment Early on</head><p>We manually judged the relevancy of retrieved documents using depth-k for k=20 for the retrieved documents and also simulated the automatic evaluation benchmark proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.77,200.65,10.45,9.13" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for the queries that contained diagnostic codes.</p><p>Due to the lack of evidence judgment for the given 4 sample queries we gathered a pool of documents retrieved by three different systems, these systems differed only in their ranking algorithms.</p><p>Annotation was done by two authors of this paper and it turned out that we had extremely low agreement on two topics, after receiving guidelines from a medical student and looking through the manual annotation, however, we arrived at perfect agreement.</p><p>Two sample queries over which we had disagreement are given below:</p><p>• Patients treated for lower extremity chronic wound</p><p>• Elderly patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia After speaking to a medical student we found out that one of the annotators mistakenly marked all types of wounds as relevant and for the second query the term associated is apparently important when used in the phrase and not individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Query Expansion</head><p>Our aim was to automatically identify terms that needed expansion and choose the best external knowledge source to expand the queries with.</p><p>We find that often query terms added from Wikipedia lead to over expansion and later we address this issue by using DBpedia<ref type="foot" coords="2,245.52,469.04,3.97,6.38" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . which offers a more structured way to access the content of Wikipedia, however, we eliminate non informative terms and headings extracted from the DBpedia.</p><p>Accessing UMLS concepts have been made easy through the MetaMap-2010 which is an open source toolkit from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), explained in details in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,454.20,506.53,10.00,9.13" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Metamap is capable of parsing and finding medical concepts with options allowing users to disambiguate and filter UMLS concepts in the text. We use metamap in two ways, firstly to identify keywords from a verbose query and secondly to extract candidate terms for query expansion. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,508.00,542.29,4.98,9.13" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrates a comparison of keyword search, expansion using the best sematic type and a plain run, confirming no improvement in using only keyword candidates from the Metamap.</p><p>We used MetaMap to find trigger words pertaining to treatment or interventions in the queries, however, for document level processing, section headings were better clues in finding treatment or intervention related terms, this is explained in more detailed in section 6.</p><p>Each concept extracted from the metamap is associated to a semantic type, we parse all the test queries and extract 61 semantic labels and use them to filter candidate terms for expansion.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,135.73,637.93,4.98,9.13" target="#fig_1">2</ref> demonstrate the effect of 20 semantic types for expansion and a list of all the semantic types numbered from 1 to 21 are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,325.33,649.93,3.90,9.13" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The process of expanding a query term using its semantic type is illustrated by an example as follow: Table <ref type="table" coords="2,116.88,673.81,4.98,9.13">2</ref> is an output generated by Metamap and the terms appearing in brackets refer to semantic   Table <ref type="table" coords="4,241.56,468.48,3.91,9.13">2</ref>: Output generated by metamap to remove negated terms from all the queries. However, later we perform an alternative to this approach by replacing negated terms in the documents, this is explained in more detail in the next section.</p><p>We install three different ranking algorithms to find a consistent trend on the performance of various methods. Numbers along the x-axis denote the expansion method described in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,498.01,549.72,3.91,9.13" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.  Removing negated terms and expanding queries using Wikipedia consistently obtains better results, note that the low average precision of the PL2 model demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,465.12,681.72,4.98,9.13">3</ref> is mainly due to the higher number of unjudged documents for this particular system while all the top 20 Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,137.17,398.16,3.90,9.13">3</ref>: Performance of 3 systems on 6 different types of expansion described in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,492.27,398.16,4.98,9.13" target="#tab_1">3</ref> documents retrieved for the other 2 systems were judged.</p><p>Document expansion was another intuitive aspect that we and other groups [6, 10, 7] looked at, particularly, two sections of the reports were likely to benefit from expansion, namely: "Discharge Diagnosis" and "Admit Diagnosis". They contain ICD codes which were not mentioned in any of the sample queries, indicating the need for expansion. We use a full description of ICD9 table to expand these codes and to index them. Extending documents, through mapping the ICD codes, led to a relative improvement of the map score of the plain run, increasing from 0.3410 to 0.3570, however this improvement was not significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Negation</head><p>NegEx <ref type="bibr" coords="5,121.55,570.12,10.58,9.13" target="#b4">[5]</ref> algorithm is mostly known to Text Mining researchers for finding terms used in negative senses. This is crucial in retrieving a medical document as practitioners often report the absence of a disease or symptoms, which can potentially mislead any ranking algorithm. If a query targets a population without a particular disease D or treatment T for instance, search engines have no way of penalizing documents for containing the word D or T by default, therefore we identify and remove the negated terms from the queries initially and later annotate the documents negating the triggered terms.</p><p>An example of a query with negated term is as follows: Query: patients with a BMI &gt; 40 without hypertension. Another alternative that we tested later was to modify the occurrence of negated nouns with a prefix "no". So the terms without hypertension would be replaced by : "nohypertension". However if the negated terms occur in the PRESENT HISTORY:hearing loss DIS DIAGNOSIS:hearing loss ELSE:with hearing loss PRESENT HISTORY:complicated gerd DIS DIAGNOSIS:complicated gerd ELSE:who receive endoscopy  <ref type="bibr" coords="6,213.50,253.57,15.49,9.13" target="#b9">[10]</ref> introduce a new tokeniser (called NegExTokeniser) and Cengage Learning <ref type="bibr" coords="6,132.02,265.57,10.58,9.13" target="#b7">[8]</ref> additionally uses their own algorithm to find uncertainty of a concept. Both of the groups incorporate information from the negation and report margninal improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Query Transformation and Field search</head><p>There are a few ways to make the language of query and document match through expanding the document, query or both. We defined a fixed array of values for each mention of Elderly, Adult, Young, Female and male in the queries.</p><p>We divide each document into 9 sections to perform fielded search, assuming that queries contain parts relevant to varying sections in the documents. These fields were identified using regular expression and separated using end of the section patterns.</p><p>We utilized field search by segmenting queries into fields such as converting age related terms, like elderly or young to the style used in the documents, and words followed by 'taking' or 'patients who are on' were grouped under the Medication field. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,351.88,427.93,4.98,9.13" target="#tab_2">4</ref> is an example of a conversion of the first two test queries into their corresponding fielded topics. However, Terrier by default imposes a boolean AND on the terms defined under fields; this experiment did not show any improvement over the plain run, as the number of retrieved documents significantly dropped resulted by aggressive AND restrictions. Another alternative to using fields is Per Field Normalization, Macdonald et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,117.01,487.69,15.50,9.13" target="#b10">[11]</ref> report great improvement in using it against the WebCLEF collection. Query terms are normalized per field assigning different weights to each, and the logic behind this technique is that varying term distribution and importance of each field such as title and content of web pages implies weighting each field differently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Indexing and Retrieval</head><p>We utilized Terrier 3.5 open source search engine <ref type="bibr" coords="6,302.36,578.29,10.45,9.13" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for indexing purpose, and rely on the Terrier's default stemmer and stop word list for queries and documents. We also remove all the terms with low idf such as patient which has a very high term frequency in the collection.</p><p>TREC participants were provided with a mapping table having to retrieve a visit for each topic rather than a report file which was just a part of a complete visit. We indexed the collection initially by treating each report as a document and later an aggregate of reports as a single visit. The results show that the latter way is more effective and obtains a higher score as shown in table 5, however, the t-test does not show any significant difference.</p><p>For retrieval we mainly tested 3 different ranking algorithms using Terrier search engine. Before the release of test queries we tested our systems to configure our final retrieval systems, however, the lack of relevance judgements prevented us from making a confirmed decision. After manually doing more relevance judgement we found that BM25 with default parameters do not perform as good as other 2 systems, this was confirmed by setting BM25 for the Lucene search engine which resulted in low performance again. Parameters used for the Okapi 25 are given in the equation 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="7,195.12,118.44,317.91,27.57">BM 25(Q, D) = (t∈Q) w t . (k 1 + 1)f d,t K + f d,t .

Other two ranking metrics used were PL2 -an advanced model from Divergence-from-Randomness, and the Lemur version of TF.IDF. For more details about the PL2 ranking algorithm please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="7,102.13,323.65,10.00,9.13" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Analysis of Results</head><p>Arguably existence of significance difference is more probable with large collections, however, recently there is more emphasis on performing tests that demonstrate the existence of any significance difference. Although our final runs were a blend of multiple experiments we intended to find the main factor, contributing to the goodness or weakness of each run, and hence we decompose each step and report significance test. We perform student t-test across 4 aspects of the experiments, explained in this section.</p><p>Firstly per visit indexing gained in higher scores, but the t-test does not show any statistical difference, with the p value &gt; 0.9, RMIT runs, albeit, perform per report indexing. Indexing visits using SinglePass indexer from the TERRIER toolkit, however, was more efficient in terms of the speed.</p><p>Choosing the ranking algorithm involved testing 3 different ranking metrics, of which BM25 performs significantly worse than other two metrics: PL2 and Lemur version of TF.IDF with p value equal to 0. Default parameters of BM25 is given in section 7, weak scores from BM25 was quite questionable and made us to try it on the Lucene search engine, however, the low performance of BM25 was rather consistent. Automatically setting the values of BM25 parameters was however, out of the scope of this paper.</p><p>The remaining tests proved the absence of significance difference on using the best semantic type expansion and extension of ICD codes in the documents versus a plain run.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">RMIT Runs</head><p>The 4 runs mainly differ in the combination of query expansion and translation used. Automatic query processing and translation was used to expand particular words that need expansion to match the language of clinical records, Prior to the release of result from the TREC, in addition to using extended judgments we utilized the automatic judgment method proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,288.14,199.32,9.91,9.13" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Trec evaluation result proves consistency to our automatic evaluation, we learn that the best ranking algorithm is the Lemur version of TF.IDF followed by PL2. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,132.00,235.20,4.98,9.13" target="#tab_5">7</ref> shows the final result for our four distinct runs, three of which contributed to the pool and one that remained unjudged. However, NIST looked at retrieved documents for unjudged runs at various cut-offs and reports that the coverage is fairly reasonable.</p></div>
