<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This year we focused on the Technology Survey (TS) task: Given a natural language description of the topic, look for related patents about that topic. The task is close to an ad hoc retrieval task, except for the additional information of the specific chemicals or chemical reactions that the user cares about. Since there are only 6 topics for the TS task, this notebook paper is more of a case study report, than the ordinary TREC report with significance tests. We found that on average, with the infAP measure, manually created conjunctive normal form queries performed similarly as automatic keyword search with some tuning of term weights. Manual queries do not seem to always help, especially when initial keyword performance is high, but can give large improvements on difficult queries. We also used the same querying strategy in the Patent Olympics 2011 ChemAthlon task, and also include some of the ChemAthlon cases in this report. Since CNF queries are strictly more expressive than keyword queries, we try to identify problems that may have caused the manual CNF queries to be seen sometimes performing worse than the automatic keyword queries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Query Formulation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Boolean CNF style queries</head><p>User information need can usually be broken down into a number of concepts that any relevant document must include in order for it to be relevant. This allows the searcher to break down the information need into a set of concepts conjoined together. Each concept would typically be represented by a number of different natural language descriptions (words or phrases or windowed occurrences) that people would use to describe these concepts in relevant documents. This results in a conjunctive normal form styled query. This kind of query has been used widely by search professionals like lawyers or librarians, as they provide more flexibility and expressiveness in matching potentially relevant documents than the bag of word (keyword) queries. A list of references for the use of CNF queries can be found in Le Zhao's thesis proposal <ref type="bibr" coords="1,464.59,573.88,10.24,9.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Example query</head><p>For example, in Indri query language, the query (topic TS-20) about "tests for HCG hormone especially in pregnancy tests" can be expressed as.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>#combine(</head><p>#syn(HCG #1(Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin) #uw2(Chorionic Gonadotropin) Choriogonadotropin Choriogonin) #syn(pregnancy pregnant women woman fertilization conception) #syn(test check detection detect) #syn(#syn(blood ) #syn(urine Urinalyses Urinalysis)) )</p><p>The #combine operator is a probabilistic AND operator, while the #syn operator treats all included terms as the same term for retrieval purposes (merging the inverted lists of the terms into one disjoined inverted list). #1 is the ordered window operator with maximum distance between words being 1 (phrase operator), #uw2 is the unordered window operator requiring all terms to appear in a text window of size 2 words.</p><p>The practitioners have known for a long time that carefully constructed CNF style queries perform better than the keyword queries. Our participation in the Chemical track Technology Survey task is to understand how high quality CNF style queries can be created, and whether they do outperform their keyword counterpart.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Keyword queries</head><p>We used simple keyword queries as baseline to compare the manual Boolean queries with.</p><p>The run CMUTStncs creates queries by aggregating all words from title, narrative and details fields. Standard stopwords were removed from the queries. For example, the generated query for topic TS-22 is: #combine(tests for HCG hormone The hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin HCG is produced when a women becomes pregnant Tests are usually carried out by analysing blood or urine We are looking for articles and patents on these pregnancy test kits or the chemical tests used to produce them Human Chionic Gonadotrophin HCG pregnancy Human Chionic Gonadotrophin HCG)</p><p>The run CMUTStncws creates queries by weighting words from title by 0.3, words from narrative by 0.6 and words from details by 0.1. The weights are trained on the TREC 2010 Chemistry track TS task. The query generated for topic TS-20 is as follows:</p><p>#weight( 0.3 #combine( tests for HCG hormone ) 0.6 #combine( The hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin HCG is produced when a women becomes pregnant Tests are usually carried out by analysing blood or urine We are looking for articles and patents on these pregnancy test kits or the chemical tests used to produce them ) 0.1 #combine( Human Chionic Gonadotrophin HCG pregnancy Human Chionic Gonadotrophin HCG ) )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Experiments</head><p>We used Indri search engine of the Lemur toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="2,313.13,491.68,11.10,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to index all the patent documents. The whole interaction process of querying the index, examining top results and modifying the query was done on the Lemur CGI Web interface using Indri query language.</p><p>Retrieval model parameter mu for Dirichlet smoothing was set at 7000 based on training performance on the TREC 2010 Chemistry track TS task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Observations</head><p>Performance statistics are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,256.61,606.07,3.78,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Weighted combination of words from the different query fields is consistently better than the simple keyword merging approach. Manual Boolean CNF style queries are not always better than the best keyword queries, and the average performance is very similar to the best keyword results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Error Analysis</head><p>In this section, we try to identify reasons why the more expressive CNF style queries can sometimes performs worse than its corresponding keyword query. We will report performance of the different types of queries on one topic, observe the corresponding manual CNF query, analyze its performance and try to point out possible reasons that cause it to perform lower than the keyword query. We also try to fix the Boolean query in straightforward ways to facilitate our analysis. However, these observations are not generalizable conclusions, which would need to be verified against test data. #syn(#1(Follicle stimulating hormone) FSH Follitropin) ) ) )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Topic TS-22</head><p>Analysis: This Boolean query performed worse than the corresponding keyword query even at top ranks. When creating the query, the #uw20 (occurrence in a window of size 20 words) node was first instantiated as a #band (Boolean AND) node, and results seem to include some false positives at top rank, so I restricted it down to a 20-word window. The second #combine node in the query was intended as a back-off query to match more documents. From the retrieval performance, even though the first #combine node matches 373 documents, it is still filtering out quite some relevant documents, decreasing infAP. Changing the #uw20 node back to #band (and removing the second #combine node) actually improves infAP to 0.3607. The new CNF query can match 3278 documents.</p><p>Cause: It takes a lot of time for someone unfamiliar with chemistry to examine top results. Because there are many different query formulations to try, on average, only a little bit of time could be spent on carefully examining the top results for one query. Because human are not very good at remembering the exact performance of a previous query, it could become difficult for the user to decide whether the performance is improved by a specific modification to the query, unless the change caused a huge difference in top precision. When there are many top false positives, and attempts to improve retrieval by CNF expansion is not seen to significantly improve top precision, the user may naturally want to further restrict the query. However, the results often times only get worse, because relevant results are being filtered out together with the false positives.</p><p>The interactive search interface can be improved to help the user recognize which documents are relevant more easily and which run is better more easily. Highlighting of query terms in result documents can speed up the relevance judgement process. Recording down which documents have already been judged and side-by-side rank list comparisons may make it easier for the user to compare runs. Analysis: The manual Boolean query is better at rank 100, but worse at rank 1000. This is because the second #uw50 (occurring in a window of size 50) operator in bold face was intended to be a #band operator. Using #uw50 must have filtered out many relevant documents at lower ranks after 100. Changing it back leads to better than keyword performance in infAP. Because the Boolean query paid no attention to the "porous particles" aspect, NDCG is slightly worse than the keyword query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Topic TS-33</head><p>Cause: Human mistakes in formulating manual queries can easily occur, and are not easy to detect at lower ranks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">A Topic from ChemAthlon 2011</head><p>Topic title: Manufacture of the potassium salt acesulfame-k. This topic came from patent search expert Stephen Adams, and was the worst performing topic within a total of four topics of the ChemAthlon task of PatOlympics 2011 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,412.09,483.79,11.40,11.04" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This topic has very few relevant patents and very many false positives in the collection, because acesulfame-k is a very commonly used sweetener, which has been used to manufacture many different products, while the topic looks for the manufacture of the chemical itself.</p><p>Manual Boolean CNF style query used in ChemAthlon 2011: #uw20( #syn(#1(acesulfame k) #1(3 oxathiazin 4 one)) #syn(produce manufacture product) )</p><p>Analysis: The original keyword query performed poorly, because first, there are different names that this popular sweetener has, second, the word "manufacture" mismatches most of the known relevant patents, and matches lots of the false positives that manufacture some product using the sweetener as an ingredient, and third, there are far more false positives than the few true relevant patents. Expanding the word "synthesis" to "manufacture" improved the retrieval performance significantly. However, the discovery of "synthesis" happened after the assigned 20 minutes of interaction time for the topic. During the competition, pressed by time, we only reacted to the many false positives which were about manufacturing something else using the sweetener, and restricted the two concepts to appear in a 20-word window, which actually hurt performance by filtering out the few relevant patents returned by the original query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Summary</head><p>False positives can be driven out of the rank list by enforcing more strict matching criteria (e.g. phrases or windowed occurrence), or can be driven to lower ranks by using CNF expansion to match and boost more relevant documents to the top. In practice, from the above three topics, it seems that the CNF expansion method is a better and more robust choice than restricting the results. In all the other four topics from the six Technology Survey topics, the manual queries did not use further windowed restriction. Three out of the four performed better than keyword, and in one case, the performance was very close to that of the keyword query.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,72.02,74.25,470.74,634.78"><head>Table 1 .
