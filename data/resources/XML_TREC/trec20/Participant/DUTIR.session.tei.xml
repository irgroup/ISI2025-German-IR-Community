<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Users often begin an interaction with a search engine with a sufficiently under-specified query that they will need to reformulate their query and/or information need several times before they find either the thing or everything they are looking for. A session is a sequence of reformulations (along with any user interaction with the retrieval system) in service of satisfying an information need.</p><p>The goal of Session Track is to test whether systems can improve their performance for a given query by using previous queries and user interactions with the retrieval system (including clicks on ranked results, dwell times, etc). There is a single task which contains four subtasks this year (RL1, RL2, RL3 and RL4), you can see the TREC 2011 Session Track Guidelines <ref type="bibr" coords="1,480.58,479.40,8.08,6.26" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for detail.</p><p>This paper describes the word done by members of DUTIR. Our goal of participating in the TREC 2011 Session Track is to get the ability to processing of large-scale corpus and do some research on query sessions. As the limited of the size of our Hadoop <ref type="bibr" coords="1,393.31,541.80,8.08,6.26" target="#b1">[2]</ref> cluster, we conduct our experiments on the smaller "Category B" collection of 50 million documents while the track encourages participants to use the whole ClueWeb09 collection. We complete the task by using Language Model, PRF, Query Expansion and so on.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the methods used for Session Track in detail. In Section 3, we demonstrate the results of our experiment and give some corresponding analysis. Finally, we give a brief conclusion and a plan for future work in Section4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our Methods for Session Track</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preprocessing of corpus</head><p>In order to improve the efficiency of indexing and retrieval, we use a Hadoop cluster which consists of 10 PC to preprocess the Clueweb corpus. There are some other processes like extracting text from web page, stemmer, removing stop words and so on. We borrow the methods used in Ivory Platform <ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.70,89.35,8.19,6.26">[3]</ref> which is a a Hadoop toolkit for web-scale information retrieval research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Retrieval Model and PRF</head><p>As we know, Language Model can get a better performance in some track tasks in general. So we use Language Model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,198.89,151.75,8.08,6.26" target="#b2">[4]</ref> as the basic retrieval model, and dirichlet smooth <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.59,151.75,8.20,6.26" target="#b3">[5]</ref> is used in the Language Model. The equation of computing document score is denoted as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,182.34,198.51,319.15,46.17">, 1 || ( | ) log || qi qi D n i c fu C LogP Q D Du      (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,501.49,224.41,4.09,9.50">)</formula><p>Where u is set to 1000 in the experiment.</p><p>The Pseudo Relevance Feedback model used in our experiments is RM <ref type="bibr" coords="2,405.07,276.58,8.08,6.26" target="#b4">[6]</ref> , in this model, we consider the top 50 documents returned by the retrieval as pseudo relevant documents, and select the top 30 terms as expansion terms, then construct a new query for retrieving again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Query Expansion Method</head><p>Query expansion is a technology to match additional documents by expanding the original search query. People can use pseudo relevant documents or some other resources(such as Wikipedia, social tags). In the Session track task, we can rely on the information contained in previous queries and user interactions, we use Query Expansion method in the last three subtasks.</p><p>In RL2 subtask, we select expansion terms from the query session prior to the current query, the terms occurs in the query which is more close to (measured by time of occurrence) the current query will get a higher weight, the equation of computing term weight is denoted as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,156.24,473.75,349.21,41.95">1 11 () ( | ) * ( | ) * N i Score q N i Weight q Q Weight q Q MAXSCORE         (2)</formula><p>Where Q ＇ is the expansion query; q ＇ is the expansion query terms; N is the number of prior queries; Score(q</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,158.30,541.19,5.52,5.82">＇</formula><p>) is the term weight in one prior query; Weight(q ＇ |Q) is the term weight in original query. In the experiment, we set α to 0.8, β to 0.2.</p><p>In RL3 subtask, we consider a prior query and its corresponding ranked list as a big document. The term weighting function is the same as equation 2.</p><p>In RL4 subtask, we make a special handling for clicked urls, if one term q ＇ occurs in the corresponding title and snippet, the weight of term q ＇ selected from this prior query will be negative. In equation 2, the corresponding Score(q ＇ ) will be negative. We think that if the user have clicked the url displayed in the prior query, he should be not satisfied with this result. The weight of term in this result should be lower. Otherwise, we haven't consider the content of the corresponding web pages. According to the observation, we find that there is much more noisy information in the web pages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiment Results</head><p>We have just submitted one group result for four subtasks. Two approaches are given to evaluate the track results:</p><p>(a) They computed evaluation scores by considering relevant those documents that are relevant to any subtopic or the general topic; if a document is relevant to more than one subtopic then the maximum grade is considered as the relevance grade of the document; the runs evaluated in this way are called "allsubtopics".</p><p>(b) They computed evaluation scores by considering relevant those documents that are relevant to the subtopic(s) that the &lt;current query&gt; corresponds to; as before if a query corresponds to more than one subtopic and a document is relevant to more than one of these subtopics the maximum grade is considered as the relevance grade of the document; the runs evaluated this way are called "lastquerysubtopics".  <ref type="table" coords="3,132.49,343.97,5.28,9.60" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the result of "allsubtopics", the Middle result presents the middle value of all results submitted, DUTIR presents our results and the Max result presents the max value of all results. We can get that each of the four subtasks is better than the middle value, our result of RL1 is close to the max value. However, the results of Query Expansion method using previous queries and user interactions are unanticipated, they are just a little higher than the result of RL1. The Middle results have the similar phenomenon, while the Max results meet the expectations, the results using previous queries and user interactions are better than the result of RL1 obviously.  <ref type="table" coords="3,132.72,549.31,5.28,9.60" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the result of "lastquerysubtopics", they are similar to the results displayed in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,117.61,565.02,3.96,9.50" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. A small difference is that the results using previous queries and user interactions are worse than RL1 results either in our results or in the Middle results. We think that our Query Expansion method has brought in some noise, we will research on how to clean the noise in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,105.74,255.73,342.65,97.84"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Result of Allsubtopics(nDCG@10)</figDesc><table coords="3,105.74,271.84,342.65,81.73"><row><cell>Result</cell><cell>RL1</cell><cell>RL2</cell><cell>RL3</cell><cell>RL4</cell></row><row><cell>Middle</cell><cell>0.3056</cell><cell>0.3130</cell><cell>0.3084</cell><cell>0.3263</cell></row><row><cell>DUTIR</cell><cell>0.3498</cell><cell>0.3592</cell><cell>0.3492</cell><cell>0.3511</cell></row><row><cell>Max</cell><cell>0.3663</cell><cell>0.4061</cell><cell>0.4086</cell><cell>0.4320</cell></row><row><cell>Table</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>

<div><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we present our submission to the <rs type="institution">TREC 2011 Session Track</rs>. We use some technologies like <rs type="person">Language Model</rs>, <rs type="funder">PRF, Query Expansion</rs> to retrieval on the Clueweb B corpus. The results show that our methods can get a good performance. Because of the noise in query sessions and we haven't do some work on understanding the query intent of users, the results of Query Expansion method using previous queries and user interactions are unanticipated. Our future work will focus on how to clean the noise in query sessions and understand the query intent.</p></div>
