<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In our first-ever appearance at TREC, we explore initial ideas on building an effective search tool over tweet stream as a participation in this year's microblog track. Among those ideas are tweet expansion with short representation of terms that frequently co-occur with hashtags and URLs, and re-ranking based on statistics that estimate user popularity (using replies and mentions), tweet popularity, URL popularity and user topic authority (using simple user profiles). Initial results show that re-ranking improves the effectiveness while expansion sometimes harms it. Overall, the system built for the task is indeed a great resource for further extensions and experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>1 Twitter, an online microblogging service, is acting the leading role in this emerging form of new media. Within the 140 characters limit, users broadcast what they experience and think about their daily life and work activities by posting short snippets of text, called tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="1,221.34,418.14,9.20,7.86" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. According to the Twitter blog, fans sent 4,064 tweets in a single second when this year's Super Bowl came to its final moments 2 , making the highest tweets per second (TPS) ever recorded for a sporting event. Based on a later report, Twitter users now send more than 140 million tweets a day 3 ; this shows the huge popularity Twitter is gaining. People use Twitter for various reasons, such as serving as information source, keeping in touch with friends, and seeking information <ref type="bibr" coords="1,276.37,501.82,9.20,7.86" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Searching Twitter is different from searching the Web. As investigated in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,116.10,522.74,9.20,7.86" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, many people are interested in searching more timely and social information on Twitter than on the Web. Many events are lively broadcasted on Twitter and searching them is highly desired. People also search for social information related to other users, e.g., they might want to know who responded to some certain tweet or to find people with similar interests.</p><p>Features of Twitter also make the search different. The most significant feature of Twitter is the 140-character limit, while general web pages can be much longer. There are also underlying consequences, for example, tweets have only text while web pages can have multimedia, and tweets are more concentrated on their topics. Another feature is that the 1 This work was performed while the third author was at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thuwal, KSA. 2 http://blog.twitter.com/2011/02/superbowl.html 3 http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/happy-birthdaytwitter.html tweets are posted by authors, called twitterers, who might be related in the social graph by the "following" relationships. There is no such explicit social information on the web. Moreover, tweets are static while web pages are not: tweets do not change after being posted, but web pages can. These features should affect the design of the search system.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce BEST, which stands for "Building Effective Search in Twitter". The goal is to build a real-time ad-hoc search system for the official tweet corpus provided by TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) 2011 Microblog Track. The real-time aspect of the search concerns the requirement that the returned tweets should be both relevant to the query and recent to the issuing time. For the required run, no external information outside the official tweet corpus may be used. In all of our four submitted runs we adhered to that condition. Our system is implemented using Hadoop, the open source implementation of MapReduce distributed programming framework <ref type="bibr" coords="1,516.55,388.11,13.49,7.86" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first discuss the related work in Section 2. We then present our system design in Section 3. In Section 4, we conduct a series of evaluations of our system and finally conclude in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we discuss the related work from the following aspects. We first discuss some investigations on Twitter that describe the user behavior and features of Twitter, followed by some current solutions of search in Twitter. We finally turn to the ranking of the search results, which is an important component in most search systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Twitter</head><p>Twitter has been more and more investigated on as it gains popularity over the Web. Researchers have asked "What" in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,359.71,592.56,9.72,7.86" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,372.24,592.56,6.47,7.86" target="#b5">5]</ref>, "Why" in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.10,592.56,9.71,7.86" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,436.63,592.56,6.48,7.86" target="#b5">5]</ref>, and "How" in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,504.79,592.56,9.71,7.86" target="#b2">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,517.31,592.56,7.17,7.86" target="#b3">3]</ref> regarding Twitter. The studies on "What" give a general picture of Twitter, like the features and constraints, user popularity, order of magnitude of number of tweets, etc. The studies on "Why" analyze the reason people use Twitter, classify the reasons into categories and also show the importance of Twitter. The studies on "How" reveal the way people use Twitter, which motivated in part some of the design decisions behind our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Searching Twitter</head><p>Currently, there have been a number of websites offering the service of real-time micro-blogging search. Twitter<ref type="foot" coords="2,276.17,55.87,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_0">4</ref> itself has search service based on the number of re-tweets while Tweetfind<ref type="foot" coords="2,97.78,76.79,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_1">5</ref> ranks search results according to authority of authors. Bing<ref type="foot" coords="2,109.22,87.25,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_2">6</ref> has also published twitter search service considering account authority and freshness of the tweets. Users can always utilize this kind of service to get tweets related to interesting topic via user-defined query. A recent paper <ref type="bibr" coords="2,283.19,120.40,9.72,7.86">[6]</ref> proposed a tweet index called TI, which indexes the tweets that are of high chance to appear as a search result while delaying the indexing of some other tweets. As a trade-off between the cost of online indexing and the quality of the search results, this paper manages not to compromise the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Ranking</head><p>As an important component in search systems, ranking functions have been discussed extensively in the context of tweet search design. Here we select some of the ranking functions to demonstrate the idea. Chen at el. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,244.00,246.76,9.71,7.86">[6]</ref> proposed a new ranking scheme by combining the relationship between the user and the tweets. The tweets are grouped into topics and the ranking of the topics are updated dynamically. TwitterRank, proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.62,288.60,9.20,7.86" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, suggested a topicsensitive influence measure to twitterers. The measure is an extension of PageRank and takes both the topical similarity between users and the link structure into account. Duan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,77.64,330.45,9.72,7.86" target="#b8">[8]</ref> proposed a ranking method that involves multiple features, including the content relevance of a tweet, twitterer authority, embedded URL, etc. and learns the best set of features to use in the rank. Two challenges that are not encountered in traditional web search are introduced here: quickly crawling relevant content and ranking documents with impoverished link and click information. Our system also puts emphasis on the retrieval of very fresh (upto-date) content. Dong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.32,414.13,9.72,7.86" target="#b9">[9]</ref> advocated a method to use the micro-blogging data stream to detect fresh URLs and employ micro-blogging data to compute novel and effective features for ranking fresh URLs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>We identify four forms of connections in Twitter. First, posting a tweet naturally connects it to its twitterer. Second, re-tweets (i.e., resending/reposting an existing tweet which is remarked by "RT"), replies (to an already posted tweet) and mentions (i.e. directing a tweet to specific twitterer(s) by using the @ convention) connect tweets with other tweets. Third, the URLs mentioned in tweets connect the tweets and the corresponding linked external web pages. Finally, the "follower graph" (explicitly constructed over the "following" relationships) connect twitterers.</p><p>As a typical information retrieval system, our system consists of preprocessing, indexing, and retrieval components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>The preprocessing step is mainly concerned with filtering out undesired tweets and preparing the desired ones for indexing. We first remove null tweets and non-English ones (since the task is only concerned with English tweets for this year). We utilized the Java Text Categorizing Library (JTCL) <ref type="foot" coords="2,347.76,55.87,3.65,5.24" target="#foot_3">7</ref> to implement language detection algorithm which is based on the technique described in Cavnar and Trenkle <ref type="bibr" coords="2,316.81,78.56,13.49,7.86" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. After this step, we get 6,035,601 English tweets. For detecting spam users, we borrowed the idea from <ref type="bibr" coords="2,513.86,89.02,9.71,7.86" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and defined the behaviors of spammers as the following: when one posted a URL at least n times or if one posted at least m URLs at least p times each. Experimentally, we set n,m,and p as 5,3,and 3 respectively and also removed the tweets of all of the detected spammers. There are 2538 spam users detected in our system this way. The survived tweets are then tokenized and stemmed. Each token is assigned a type (i.e., "retweet", "mention", "reply", "hashtag", or "other"). Later in the pipeline we need to calculate some statistics about URL popularity, tweet popularity, and user popularity, as explained in Section 3.3, so we built a database to store needed properties of tweets in this step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Indexing</head><p>One of the challenges of the task is the tight length limitation of the tweets, which makes them very short and hence sometimes hard to understand in isolation. To tackle this problem, we proposed to expand the tweets in three different ways. The first one involves a tweet property called "hashtag". The hashtag (which is denoted by a # followed by a tag) is a form of reflecting the topic (or the context) of the tweet (e.g., #jan25). We aim to expand a tweet that includes a hashtag by appending a short representation of the hashtag. To represent a hashtag in terms, we choose the terms that co-occur with it most frequently. Secondly, we do the same way of expansion with URLs that are mentioned in the tweets. We build two indexes that map hashtags and URLs to their frequently co-occurred terms. Both indexes are used to expand tweets that include hashtags and/or URLs by the corresponding expansion terms on the fly at indexing time. We also build a short profile for each twitterer that includes the most frequent terms appear in his/her tweets. We then build a third index that maps terms that appear in any of these profiles to their corresponding twitterers. Given query terms, we compute authority scores for twitterers using this index. These three indexes are build in addition to the conventional inverted index that associates terms with the tweets in which they occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Ranking and Retrieval</head><p>Given a query, we rank tweets in two steps. The first one (called primary ranking) reflects both the content similarity (using traditional retrieval models) and tweet recency (computed relative to the timestamp of the query). For the content similarity, we choose IDF instead of TF-IDF since term frequency may give out a misleading effect given the short length of the tweets. For the tweet recency, we only pick up the 10000 most recent tweets before the query timestamp. At the end of this stage, we get 100 most similar tweets. The second step re-ranks the top tweets resulted from the first stage using a list of computed statistics that has been made possible by querying a database. The computed features are: user popularity, URL popularity, tweet popularity, and user authoritative score. User popularity was initially supposed to reflect the popularity of the user using the follower graph (either by computing PageRank-like score for each twitterer, or simply as the number of followers). Unfortunately, the "following" relationships are not included in the given collection of tweets, thus we decided to estimate it based on the number of replies to the user, number of users mentioning him/her, and number of users who retweeted any of his/her tweets. URL popularity is defined as a frequency of a URL appearance in the collection. The tweet popularity is defined as the frequency of retweeting it. Finally, user authoritative score is computed over the frequency of terms appearing in the user profiles. The final score is computed as a weighted sum over these scores. At the end of this stage, we get 50 tweets with the highest score at the re-ranking stage. The final step is to sort these 50 tweets by timestamp in descending order according to TREC requirement. The entire processing pipeline is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,251.59,183.17,3.58,7.86">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>We conducted several experiments on our implementation of the BEST system. We focus here on the experiments related to the design of our tweet expansion and re-ranking feature. Both parts have several capabilities that we can enable and disable for our experiments and several parameters that were experimentally tuned. The results of the experiments are interesting because they helped us identify which of the features we considered were effective. The evaluation measure used in all of the following experiments is average precision at 30.</p><p>As we described earlier, we expand tweets with short term representation of hashtags and URLs with the goal of enriching the tweet content with terms that can describe the hashtag and URLs more verbosely. Re-ranking uses a combination of 5 features, as follows:</p><p>• content similarity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• user authority</head><p>• user popularity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• tweet popularity</head><p>• URL popularity Our system combines these factors to recompute tweet scores after performing primary ranking, which considers only content similarity and recency.</p><p>The four combinations of enabling/disabling tweet expansion and re-ranking represent our four official submitted runs. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,105.97,524.88,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reports average precision at 30 (considering all relevant tweets) for each combination, while Table <ref type="table" coords="4,268.58,535.35,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_1">2</ref> only incorporates high relevant tweets.  <ref type="table" coords="4,141.23,648.42,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_1">2</ref> indicate that the re-ranking clearly improves the effectiveness, while expansion actually was harmful. Further analysis shows that expansion do enrich the content of a tweet, but this enrichment could be misleading.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,88.82,690.26,4.61,7.86">3</ref> shows the evaluation results by tweet reranking score instead of timestamp in descending order. It shows that there is a slight improvement over the the previous   The scores above clearly indicate that the unofficial runs outperform the official ones after the modifications and bug fixes. We also notice that spam user ltering does not harm the precision at all, hashtag expansion was harmful, and URL expansion actually improves the results a bit. In our official submitted runs, we did not separate these two expansions so that we cannot tell which one is deleterious. Finally, as our official runs, the re-ranking feature effectively improves the system performance in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,316.81,669.34,3.58,7.86" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Surprisingly, there is a slight drop in precision comparing re-ranking run with the run without any feature according to Table <ref type="table" coords="4,353.02,690.26,3.58,7.86" target="#tab_4">5</ref>; we need to do more investigation into that since Table <ref type="table" coords="4,343.56,700.73,4.61,7.86" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows re-ranking feature effectively improves the precision. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this work, we present a first implementation of a search system based on Hadoop simulating real-time search in tweet stream. The main features we tried in that implementation include spam user detection, hashtag and URL expansion, estimation of user popularity and topic authority, and reranking. According to our initial experimental results and analysis, we found the spam user detection and re-ranking the most useful features that clearly improve efficiency and effectiveness respectively. However, we noticed that expansion techniques (in the simple forms we attempted) were not that beneficial and even sometimes harm the performance. We leave exploring more sophisticated ways of expansion and performing more experiments on leveraging combination of features to future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,260.52,606.52,83.82,6.91"><head>Figure 1 Figure 1 :</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1: System Pipeline</figDesc></figure>
