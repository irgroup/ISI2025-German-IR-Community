<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper provides an overview of the Task 2: What is unclear? of the Automatic Simplification of Scientific Texts (SimpleText) lab, run as part of CLEF 2022. The main aim of the SimpleText lab is to promote a more open scientific information access via automatic text simplification. Task 2 focuses on complexity spotting within scientific texts (passage). Thus, the goal is to detect the terms/concepts that require specific background knowledge for understanding of the passage and to assess their complexity for non-experts. Overall, four runs from four different teams have been submitted to this task. In this paper, we describe the data collection, the task setup, and the evaluation procedure. We also give a brief overview of the participating approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Nowadays, scientific literature has become more available to every citizen thanks to digitalisation. However, an important barrier preventing citizens to access the objective scientific knowledge from the original sources remains present. One of the key issues here is a high complexity of scientific texts to non-experts due to the lack of required background knowledge, including the comprehension of terminology. Even for native speakers it is hard to understand the terminology beyond their area of expertise. Nevertheless, a basic set of terms the general public acquired thanks to secondary and college education allows them to comprehend popular science publications. Comprehension of the term presupposes grasping of the concept it refers to without any definition. To understand the concept, we need to involve it in a structured system in our semantic memory that can require more knowledge than we had learned.</p><p>To help readers to stay up-to-date with scientific advances, text simplification can be used. To facilitate the reading, the traditional methods try to eliminate complex concepts and constructions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.86,141.16,11.36,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, it is not always possible, especially in the case of scientific literature. Thus, readers of a popular science publication lean on their experience of processing new information and recognize a case when they need definition or clarification of an unfamiliar term since they do not understand its concept.</p><p>To alleviate the lack of background knowledge that can prevent a proper comprehension <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.15,195.36,11.28,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we argue that a simplification method should provide information, essential to understanding of complex scientific concepts. This is one of the objectives of CLEF 2022 SimpleText lab. Despite some recent efforts that have been done in automatic text simplification (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.55,236.01,11.21,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), improving scientific text comprehensibility and its adaptation to different audiences in an automatic manner remains an open challenge.</p><p>The CLEF 2022 SimpleText track <ref type="foot" coords="2,241.50,274.90,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is an open forum for researchers and practitioners working on the automatic generation of simplified summaries of scientific texts. It is a new evaluation lab that follows up the CLEF 2021 SimpleText Workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.02,303.75,11.28,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The track provides data and benchmarks for discussing the challenges of automatic text simplification proposing the following interconnected tasks: Task 1: What is in (or out)? Select passages to include in a simplified summary, given a query.</p><p>Task 2: What is unclear? Given a passage and a query, rank terms/concepts that are required to be explained for understanding this passage (definitions, context, applications,..).</p><p>Task 3: Rewrite this! Given a query, simplify passages from scientific abstracts.</p><p>This paper focuses on the second task of complexity spotting. We refer for details of the other tasks to the overview papers of Task 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.29,456.35,12.84,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Task 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.33,456.35,11.43,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, or the Track overview paper <ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.78,456.35,11.43,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In the CLEF 2022 edition of SimpleText, a total of 62 teams registered for the SimpleText track. A total of 40 users downloaded data from the server. A total of 9 distinct teams submitted 24 runs, of which 10 runs were updated. The details of statistics on runs submitted for shared tasks are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,190.47,510.55,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As it can be seen, four teams participated in Task 2.</p><p>The rest of this paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 presents a brief overview of related works, including other evaluation initiatives, related tasks and related approaches. We provide a detailed description of the task complexity spotting itself, submitted runs, and the evaluation protocol in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the results of the official submissions. We end with Section 5 discussing the results and findings, and lessons for the future.</p></div>

Thus, terms form the core vocabulary of a specific and specialised domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Term Complexity</head><p>Term perception can be rather ambiguous and subjective <ref type="bibr" coords="3,354.45,365.01,16.41,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, especially when it comes to assess term complexity. Indeed, the discrepancy between basic competence of a reader and professional competence of an author of a scientific article derives the subjective complexity of terminology. The objective complexity of terminology is derived by peculiar characteristics of terminological systems. In this Section, we clarify the objective complexity of terminology caused by complexity of research areas, research traditions and socio-cultural diversity. Terminology belongs to professional and scientific discourse, where there exist so called languages for special purpose. Belonging to the language for special purposes, terminological systems do not share peculiarities of the general lexicon <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.79,473.40,16.11,10.91" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. A terminological system tends to avoid synonyms and polysemy, but has to provide a term for each concept within a system of concepts of the domain. According to the General Theory of Terminology, which is based on the work of Eugen Wüster (see description in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,295.40,514.05,15.76,10.91" target="#b18">[20]</ref>), terminological systems support univocity (unambiguous match of the term to its concept). This general approach is still relevant in technical communication where professionals (technical writers, translators, etc.) use term banks, e.g. Eurodicautom<ref type="foot" coords="3,198.60,552.94,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , Termium<ref type="foot" coords="3,247.16,552.94,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> , LEXIS <ref type="foot" coords="3,282.82,552.94,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> [21], Normaterm<ref type="foot" coords="3,361.90,552.94,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,368.03,554.70,16.09,10.91" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, and the Grand dictionnaire terminologique <ref type="foot" coords="3,156.72,566.49,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> (formerly the Banque de terminologie du Québec). In academia, this approach is mostly applied to terminological systems in Science and Computer Science; however, it is not relevant for Cognitive Science (e.g., Neuroscience) and Humanities.</p><p>Complexity of a terminological system is a derivative of scientific complexity. The complexity of a scientific area depends on peculiar attributes and conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,439.09,114.06,16.41,10.91" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. The most basic peculiarities are the numerosity of counting entities and their interaction: high diversity of disordered interaction among multiple entities represents a complex research area. To refer to the entities, their interactions and degrees of disorder, the research area needs complex terminology. Ladyman et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,216.84,168.26,17.86,10.91" target="#b22">[24]</ref> offered to determine complexity of a research area according to five qualitative conditions: numerosity of elements, numerosity of interactions, disorder, openness, feedback. Considering terminological systems, numerosity of elements and numerosity of interactions in a complex research area require a rich and clear structured system of terms, preferably taxonomy. Transparency of the terminological system structure facilitates the research, analysis and description of disordered systems and non-equilibrium states of the systems. Effect of numerosity of elements and their interactions on the complexity of the terminological system of the research area is obvious through comparison of different areas that attract interest of wide readership: Neuroscience and Computer Science <ref type="bibr" coords="4,432.19,276.66,16.25,10.91" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</p><p>The complexity of terminology is associated with a formal representation (signifier) of a term. Putting aside borrowings, we would like to mention symbols and abbreviations (acronyms, backronyms, syllabic abbreviations, clipping etc.). Symbols and abbreviations belong to a set of peculiarities of a language for special purpose. Symbolic language of science involves symbols and abbreviations as means to optimize content transferring, to standardize naming of numerous elements, frequent interaction among them, and standard procedures of data processing. Languages for special purpose in Natural Science and Mathematical Sciences (including Computer Science) contain complicated systems of symbols. Meanwhile, symbols and abbreviations are in use in all research areas disregarding their complexity. Nevertheless, readers of popularized publications expect explanations of the symbols and abbreviations.</p><p>Another cause of the terminological complexity is research traditions. Neuroscience and computer science represent the new research areas. Nevertheless, humans became curious about the brain and how to treat its damage thousands years ago; the brain has attracted researchers' attention since the very first steps in practical medicine. The neuroscientific terminology reflects rich traditions of the brain study in the history of science: Latin (e.g. cerebellum 'little brain') and Greek (e.g. diencephalon 'interbrain') borrowings, eponyms (Broca's area), metaphors (e.g. hemispheres), etc. Diversity of the traditions provides neuroscience with parallel terms, which refer to the same concept (e.g., names of the disease: <ref type="bibr" coords="4,326.66,520.54,15.76,10.91" target="#b24">[26]</ref>). Understanding the neuroscientific terminology requires knowledge of the science development.</p><p>Computer science has begun to develop its traditions mostly in the middle of the XX century; therefore, it lacks Latin and Greek terminology as well as numerous eponyms. As compared to neuroscience, the terminology in computer science seems less complicated and more transparent for nonprofessionals; moreover, an average reader of popularized science understands many terms since he / she employs computers in the everyday routine. Readership of popular science publications is probably familiar with the basic terminology of this area, while the neuroscientific terminology requires definitions and clarifications.</p><p>The complexity of terminology is often caused by socio-cultural diversity of readership of popular science publications. The diversity is revealed in comprehension of basic terminology of Science and Humanities that is affected by programs of secondary and college education.</p><p>The programs provide people with grounds and backdrops for comprehending current news of popular science. Since content of the programs varies in different institutions and countries, readers have differences in their background and terminological lexicon especially in Humanities.</p><p>While popularizing science, journalists substitute complex terms by basic ones or clarify the underlying concept, which is denoted by the complex term. Enhancing the popular science text readability, popularization may bring in damaging its comprehensibility. Both ways to avoid the complex terminology may lead to misinformation or distortion of the content. The term substitution may distort the content since semantic relations in terminological systems are not similar to those in the general lexicon of the language. It is presupposed that a network of connections within a terminological system does not support synonyms and maintains a transparent one-to-one relationship between the term and the concept it referred to. A list of the potential substitutions usually includes a widespread name of the concept if any exists in the general lexicon (e.g. sea cow instead of manatee), hypernym (e.g. herbivore marine mammal for manatee) and co-hyponyms of the complex term with additional explanation since co-hyponyms denote a different object (quality, action, etc.) within the same category. Meanwhile, commonsense concepts are not equal to scientific concepts in the complex research areas; therefore, appealing to the common sense requires clarifications. Thus, term substitutions do not enhance structure of the popular scientific text. Probably, the best way to clarify the term is to illustrate its concept <ref type="bibr" coords="5,140.14,330.85,16.25,10.91" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Speaking about automatic systems of generating a popular review of scientific publications, we need to choose the way for term recognition and extraction. In order to substitute or clarify any unfamiliar term we need to recognize it in scientific discourse and then provide readers with references, definitions or illustrations.</p><p>Summarizing our consideration of complexity of terminology, we note that the selection of a way to facilitate perception of terms in popular scientific publications depends on complexity of the research area, richness of the research tradition of the area, and cultural diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Automatic Terminology Extraction</head><p>Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) or Automatic Terminology Extraction is an automated process of detecting terms in a corpus of specialised texts. It has been a relevant NLP task since 1980s and remains challenging from several perspectives, such as data collection (creation of manually annotated domain-specific corpora), extraction algorithms (definition of term length, minimum term frequency, term POS-pattern), evaluation (usually limited to the use of precision metric as the information about all terms in a text is often missing) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,346.80,543.17,16.25,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The ATE methods are traditionally classified in three groups:</p><p>• Linguistic methods: these methods are based on linguistic properties such as POS-patterns or other morpho-syntactic patters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,291.63,595.77,16.43,10.91" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,310.79,595.77,11.81,10.91" target="#b27">29]</ref>). • Statistical methods: these methods are based on statistical properties (various weightings have been proposed, e.g. frequency, mutual information, log-likelihood ratio, etc.) and usually analyse 𝑛-grams measuring termhood or unithood <ref type="bibr" coords="5,379.63,637.77,16.25,10.91" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. • Hybrid methods: these methods are combinations of the previous two (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,445.56,652.68,15.62,10.91" target="#b29">[31]</ref>). Usually, the initial selection is performed based on linguistic properties which is followed by the ranking procedure on the basis of statistical measures <ref type="bibr" coords="6,353.15,86.97,16.09,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. Hybrid approaches have been shown to outperform linguistic or statistical methods <ref type="bibr" coords="6,356.46,100.52,16.25,10.91" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>As stated in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,160.29,126.02,16.42,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, one of the difficulties is to well define the cut-off threshold for term candidates.</p><p>Recent advances in Machine Learning techniques, including Deep Learning models, have made the taxonomy of ATE methodology more complex and diverse <ref type="bibr" coords="6,395.28,166.67,16.24,10.91" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. Numerous methods have been proposed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,202.13,180.22,16.43,10.91" target="#b32">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,221.29,180.22,11.81,10.91" target="#b33">35]</ref>).</p><p>Lately, large transformer models such as Jurassic-1 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,337.33,193.77,16.41,10.91" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, Google's T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,419.24,193.77,16.41,10.91" target="#b35">[37]</ref>, BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,472.46,193.77,16.41,10.91" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, or GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,119.86,207.32,17.86,10.91" target="#b37">[39]</ref> have been shown to be successful on several NLP tasks, outperforming other stateof-the-art models. They make use of subword tokenizers, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,488.22,220.86,17.76,10.91" target="#b38">[40]</ref> and WordPiece <ref type="bibr" coords="6,159.55,234.41,16.31,10.91" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. For instance, BPE that uses the idea of word segmentation into subword units is exploited in GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,212.79,247.96,18.06,10.91" target="#b40">[42]</ref> and Roberta <ref type="bibr" coords="6,291.35,247.96,16.42,10.91" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. A similar subword tokenization algorithm WordPiece is ussed in BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,221.62,261.51,16.41,10.91" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, DistilBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,299.40,261.51,16.41,10.91" target="#b42">[44]</ref>, and Electra <ref type="bibr" coords="6,378.35,261.51,16.41,10.91" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. Despite a comparative shallowness of these models, they have been shown to be quite effective for the related use case of languages with large vocabularies and many rare words <ref type="bibr" coords="6,351.11,288.61,16.39,10.91" target="#b44">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,370.24,288.61,12.29,10.91" target="#b38">40]</ref>. Therefore, their use might be promising for terminology extraction.</p><p>In the context of term extraction from scientific texts with the final goal of text simplification, it is also important to consider named entities. Named entities are objects, abstract or physical, such as a person, location, organization, product, etc., that can be denoted with a proper name. They can also designate certain natural terms like biological species, substances <ref type="bibr" coords="6,458.53,356.36,16.42,10.91" target="#b45">[47]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Related Evaluation Initiatives</head><p>This section presents a brief overview of related evaluation initiatives, related tasks and related approaches.</p><p>CLEF SimpleText track was first accepted in 2020 (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,333.83,466.26,17.75,10.91" target="#b47">[49]</ref> for the overview of the first edition of CLEF SimpleText workshop). However, there have been other initiatives addressing the related topics on scholarly document processing at NLP conference.</p><p>The lack of background knowledge can become a barrier to reading comprehension and there is a knowledge threshold allowing reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" coords="6,359.27,520.45,11.59,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Scientific text simplification presupposes the facilitation of readers' understanding of complex content by establishing links to basic lexicon while traditional methods of text simplification try to eliminate complex concepts and constructions <ref type="bibr" coords="6,215.89,561.10,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. SimpleText is not limited to a "Split and Rephrase" task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,487.92,561.10,18.06,10.91" target="#b48">[50]</ref> but also aims to provide a sufficient context to a scientific text. Entity linking could mitigate the background knowledge problem, by providing definitions, illustrations, examples, and related entities, but the existing entity linking datasets are focused on people, places, and organisation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,149.01,615.30,16.41,10.91" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, while a non-expert reader of a scientific article needs assistance with new concepts and methods. INEX/CLEF'11-14 Tweet Contextualization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,379.22,628.85,17.76,10.91" target="#b50">[52]</ref> and CLEF'16-17 Cultural Microblog Contextualization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,222.65,642.40,18.06,10.91" target="#b51">[53]</ref> tracks aim to provide lacking background knowledge to a tweet. Besides completely different nature of tweets and popular science, this use case differs from the text simplification as this lack of background knowledge is due to the tweet length.</p><p>In contrast to the Background Linking task at TREC'20 News Track <ref type="bibr" coords="7,396.76,86.97,16.38,10.91" target="#b52">[54]</ref>, SimpleText focuses on (1) scientific text; (2) selection of notions to be explained; (3) helpfulness of the provided information rather than its relevance.</p><p>Probably, the closest evaluation campaign to SimpleText's task 2 is TermEval 2020: Shared Task on Automatic Term Extraction Using Annotated Corpora for Term Extraction Research (ACTER) Dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="7,125.58,154.71,16.28,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. One of the challenges related to term extraction methodology is stated to be the definition of the degree of specialisation or domain-specification required for a lexical item to be considered a term. This aspect which is difficult to quantify is partially tackled under "term difficulty" goal of the task 2 of the CLEF SimpleText lab. TermEval was set up as a binary task: term or not. In contrast to that, SimpleText aims at detecting a term and identifying its difficulty level.</p><p>Datasets Simple Wikipedia based datasets could be useful to train AI models but (1) they are not scientific publications; (2) there is no direct correspondence between Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia articles <ref type="bibr" coords="7,169.93,278.11,16.09,10.91" target="#b53">[55]</ref>. Another dataset was introduced at TAC 2014 Biomedical Summarization Track <ref type="bibr" coords="7,118.41,291.66,18.07,10.91" target="#b54">[56]</ref> with a goal to retrieve important aspects of a paper from the perspective of the community. In TermEval task <ref type="bibr" coords="7,229.38,305.21,16.41,10.91" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, the organisers proposed ACTER, a manually annotated domain-specific corpora covering 3 languages (English, French, and Dutch) and four domains (corruption, dressage (equitation), heart failure, and wind energy). The annotators labelled around 50k token for each language and domain. The tokens were judged according to their degree of domain-specificity and lexicon-specificity. Three term labels were used: Specific Terms (i.e. domain-and lexicon-specific), Common Terms (domain-specific, not lexicon-specific), and Out-of-Domain (OOD) Terms (not domain-specific, lexicon-specific). In SimpleText, we focus on term difficulty which is in line with lexicon-specificity of TermEval task (in particular, when using 3-point scale), without assessing domain-specificity.</p><p>In contrast to that, we evaluate simplification in terms of lexical and syntax complexity combining with error analysis. As we demonstrated previously, scientific information is often distorted accidentally due to misunderstanding of terminology, omission of essential details, insertion of erroneous background etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,260.56,467.80,16.08,10.91" target="#b53">[55]</ref>. Information distortion analysis is close to scientific claim verification <ref type="bibr" coords="7,167.79,481.35,16.30,10.91" target="#b55">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,186.64,481.35,13.95,10.91" target="#b56">58]</ref> but fact checking is limited to search for relevant evidence and decide whether it supports the claim. Another close work is <ref type="bibr" coords="7,327.34,494.90,16.27,10.91" target="#b57">[59]</ref>, where the TF-IDF cosine similarity between documents is computed on (1) a collection of abstracts of scientific papers from the Citation Network Dataset V1 AMINER <ref type="bibr" coords="7,272.99,522.00,18.06,10.91" target="#b58">[60]</ref> and (2) a set of articles from Huffington Post. However, this approach is not robust to lexical changes, which are crucial for text simplification. To the best of our knowledge, no other automatic nor semi-automatic method for information distortion analysis exists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CLEF 2022 SimpleText Task 2 Test Collection</head><p>In this section, we discuss the second task about complexity spotting in an extracted sentence from a scientific abstract, addressing the task:</p><p>Given a passage and a query, rank terms/concepts that are required to be explained for understanding this passage (definitions, context, applications etc.).</p><p>The goal of this task is to decide which terms (up to 5) require explanation and contextualization to help a reader to understand a complex scientific text -for example, with regard to a query, terms that need to be contextualized (with a definition, example and/or use-case). For each passage, participants should provide a ranked list of difficult terms with corresponding scores on the scale 1-3 (3 to be the most difficult terms, while the meaning of terms scored 1 can be derived or guessed) and on the scale 1-5 (5 to be the most difficult terms). Passages (sentences) are considered to be independent, i.e. difficult term repetition was allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Train Data</head><p>For this task, data is two-fold: Medicine and Computer Science, as these two domains are the most popular on forums like ELI5 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,243.07,231.54,16.50,10.91" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,262.30,231.54,12.37,10.91" target="#b59">61]</ref>.

A master student in Technical Writing and Translation manually annotated each sentence by extracting difficult terms and attributing difficulty scores on a scale of 1-3 (3 to be the most difficult terms, while the meaning of terms scored 1 can be derived or guessed) and on a scale of 1-5 (5 to be the most difficult terms).</p><p>In 2022, we introduced new data based on Google Scholar and PubMed articles on muscle hypertrophy and health annotated by a master student in Technical Writing and Translation, specializing in these domains. The selected abstracts included the objectives of the study, the results and sometimes the methodology. The abstracts including only the topic of the study were excluded because of the lack of information. To avoid the curse of knowledge, another master student in Technical Writing and Translation not familiar with the domain was solicited for complexity spotting.</p><p>We provided 453 annotated examples in total.</p></div>
