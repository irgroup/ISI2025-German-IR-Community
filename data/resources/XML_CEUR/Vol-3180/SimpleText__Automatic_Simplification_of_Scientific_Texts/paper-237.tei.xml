<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Digitization and open access have made scientific literature available to every citizen. While this is an important first step, there are several remaining barriers preventing laypersons to access the objective scientific knowledge in the literature. In particular, scientific texts are often hard to understand as they require solid background knowledge and use tricky terminology. Although there were some recent efforts on text simplification (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,349.48,501.52,11.21,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), removing such understanding barriers between scientific texts and general public in an automatic manner is still an open challenge.</p><p>The CLEF 2022 SimpleText track brings together researchers and practitioners working on the generation of simplified summaries of scientific texts. It is a new evaluation lab that follows up the SimpleText-2021 Workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="1,243.70,569.27,11.37,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The track provides data and benchmarks for discussion of challenges of automatic text simplification by bringing in the following interconnected tasks: </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CLEF 2022 SimpleText Task 3 Test Collection</head><p>In this section, we discuss the third task about text simplification proper, rewriting an extracted sentence from a scientific abstract, addressing the task: Given a query, simplify passages from scientific abstracts.</p><p>The goal of this task is to provide a simplified version of text passages (sentences) with regard to a query. Participants were provided with queries and abstracts of scientific papers. The abstracts could be split into sentences. The simplified passages were evaluated manually in terms of the produced errors as follows. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Train Data</head><p>As for Task 2: What is unclear?, we provided a parallel corpus of simplified sentences from two domains: Medicine and Computer Science. As previously, we use scientific abstracts from the DBLP Citation Network Dataset for Computer Science and Google Scholar and PubMed articles on muscle hypertrophy and health Medicine <ref type="bibr" coords="3,287.83,355.88,16.43,10.91" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.99,355.88,12.32,10.91" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Text passages issued from abstracts on computer science were simplified by either a master student in Technical Writing and Translation or a pair of experts: (1) a computer scientist and (2) a professional translator, English native speaker but not specialist in computer science <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.42,396.53,16.19,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Each passage was discussed and rewritten multiple times until it became clear for non-computer scientists. Medicine articles were annotated by a master student in Technical Writing and Translation specializing in this domain. Sentences were shortened, excluding every detail that was irrelevant or unnecessary to the comprehension of the study, and rephrased, using simpler vocabulary. If necessary, concepts were explained.</p><p>We provided 648 parallel sentences in total.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Test Data</head><p>We used the same 116,763 sentences retrieved by the ElasticSearch engine from the DBLP dataset according to the queries as for Task 2. We manually evaluated 2,276 pairs of sentences for 11 queries. For the query Digital assistant we took the first 1,000 sentences retrieved by ElasticSearch. We pool source sentences coupled with their simplified versions submitted by all participants for all these queries. We ensured that for each evaluated source sentence the pool contained the results of all participants. The detailed statistics of the number of evaluated sentences per query for Task 3 are given in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,310.46,608.84,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>We filtered out the simplified sentences identical to the source ones and the truncated simplified sentences by keeping only passages matching the regular expression (valid snippets):</p><p>.+[?.!"\']\s*\$' Professional linguists manually annotated simplifications provided with regard to a query according to the following criteria. We evaluated binary errors:</p><p>• Incorrect syntax; • Unresolved anaphora due to simplification; • Unnecessary repetition/iteration (lexical overlap); • Spelling, typographic or punctuation errors.</p><p>The lexical and syntax complexity of the produced simplifications were assessed on an absolute scale, value 1 referring to a simple output sentence regardless of the complexity of the source one, 7 corresponding to a complex one. Lexical complexity is mostly identical to that presented in Task 2, see the Track overview <ref type="bibr" coords="5,240.58,127.61,12.84,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Task overview <ref type="bibr" coords="5,342.73,127.61,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>We consider syntax complexity based on syntactic dependencies, their length and depth. The dependency trees reveal latent complications for reading and understanding text; thus, psycho-linguists consider the syntactic dependencies to be a relevant tool to evaluate text readability <ref type="bibr" coords="5,139.59,181.81,16.25,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The depth and length of the syntactic chains we interpret according to <ref type="bibr" coords="5,479.72,181.81,16.25,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate syntax complexity as follows:</p><p>1. Simple sentence (without negation / passive voice): Over Facebook, we find many interactions. 2. Simple sentence with negation / passive voice (e.g. Many interactions were found over <ref type="bibr" coords="5,484.99,245.15,17.67,9.72;5,116.56,258.70,24.05,9.72">Facebook)</ref> or Simple sentences with syntactic constructions that show chains of dependency and shallow embedding depth (e.g. Over Facebook, we find many interactions between public pages and both political wings.) 3. Simple sentences with long chains of dependency and shallow embedding depth, with syntactic constructions like complex object, gerund construction, etc. (e.g. Despite the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so-called collective intelligence, conspiracy theories have emerged.) or Short complex or compound sentence (e.g. We propose a novel approach that was used in terms of information theory.) 4. Simple sentences with long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth, with syntactic constructions like complex object, gerund construction, etc. (e.g. Over Facebook, we find many interactions between public pages for military and veterans, and both sides of the political spectrum) or Complex or compound sentence that contains long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth; 5. Simple sentences with long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth, with several syntactic constructions like complex object, gerund construction, etc. or &amp; Complex or compound sentence that contains long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth; 6. Complex or compound sentences that contain long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth along with complex object, gerund construction, etc. or Simple sentence that contains modifications, topicalization, parenthetical constructions: Moreover, we measure the effect of 4709 evidently false information (satirical version of conspiracist stories) and 4502 debunking memes (information aiming at contrasting unsubstantiated rumors) on polarized users of conspiracy claims. 7. Long complex or compound sentences that contain several clauses of different types, long chains of dependency and deep embedding depth along with complex object, gerund construction, etc.</p><p>We evaluate the information quality of the simplified snippet based on its content and readability. Transformation of information from the source snippet brings in omission of details, insertion of basic terms to explain particular terminology and complex concepts, reference to resources. Due to necessary insertions and references, the simplified snippets often contain more words and syntactic constructions as compared to their source. Nevertheless, the goal is to reduce lexical and syntax complexity in the extended simplified snippets. In case the simplified snippet lacks information mentioned in the source, we evaluate the degree of the information loss. Irrelevant insertions, iterations and wordy statements in the extended simplified snippet we consider as a misrepresentation or distortion of source information when a reader experiences difficulties in processing source content due to wordiness of the loosely structured simplified snippet.</p><p>We assessed the information loss severity during the simplification with regard to a given query on the scale from 1 to 7, where 1 corresponds to unimportant information loss while 7 refers to the most severe information distortion. We consider the information loss as a kind of information damage even if the information in the simplified text contains the information of the source passage but has some insertions, which impedes perception of the content.</p><p>We distinguish the following 11 types of misrepresentation of source information. Our classification leans on the error typology in machine translation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,345.78,249.56,16.31,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,364.51,249.56,12.23,10.91" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The simplified snippet often combines several types of distortion, e.g. omission and ambiguity. Nevertheless, we observed many instances of small distortions that severely diminish the quality of the simplification; therefore, we need to explain each type providing the clear and transparent instances. Our evaluation of the value of the information distortion leans on the calculation of the information loss and assessment of the diminished readability of the simplified snippet that generates difficulties in text semantic processing by readers.</p><p>We distinguish the following types of information distortion:</p><p>1. Style (distortion severity 1) Source snippet: In order to facilitate knowledge transfer between specialists and generalists and between experts and novices, and to promote interdisciplinary communication, there is a need to provide methods and tools for doing so.</p><p>Simplified snippet: There is a need to provide methods and tools for doing so. In order to facilitate knowledge transfer between specialists and generalists and between experts and novices, we need to promote interdisciplinary communication. We need to make it easier for people to share their knowledge with each other. Comment: Deviations from the style norms do not lead to information loss; however, they diminish the quality of text structure and affect readers' assessment of the text and its content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Insertion of unnecessary details with regard to a query(distortion severity 1)</head><p>Source snippet: In the clinical setting, availability of needed information can be crucial during the decision-making process.</p><p>Simplified snippet: availability of needed information can be crucial during the decisionmaking process. In the clinical setting, needed information is often difficult to come by. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details Comment: The simplified snippet often contains more information than the source since the terminology is needed to be explained. An irrelevant insertion does not lead to the loss of information; however, it may bring in diminishing of the text readability and generate discomfort during text perception. The irrelevant reference to the support in the simplified snippet does not clarify the source. The source does not need any simplification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Redundancy (without lexical overlap) (distortion severity 2)</head><p>Source snippet: The capability to get updated information and news is an important and decisive factor in business and finance.</p><p>Simplified snippet: The capability to get updated information and news is an important and decisive factor in business and finance. The ability to get updates on the latest news is also an important factor in the success of a business or finance company. For more information, visit CNN.com/News. Comment: Irrelevant insertions, iterations and wordy statements in the extended simplified snippet we consider as a misrepresentation or distortion of source information when a reader may misunderstand source content due to wordiness of the loosely structured simplified snippet. Comment: Simplified texts regularly omit details and minor concepts since the objective of the simplification is to facilitate perception and processing of the main idea and novel information of the source. Therefore, distinguishing the essential details and concepts from the minor ones plays a crucial role in the text simplification. Omission of the essential details leads to the lack of information and novelty of the message. The simplified snippet lacks the essential information about the direction where the young people's web practice needs to be repatriated (to social contexts of everyday life).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Overgeneralization (distortion severity 5)</head><p>Source snippet: Online Social Networks explode with activity whenever a crisis event takes place.</p><p>Simplified snippet: It explodes when a crisis event takes place.</p><p>Comment: In the simplified snippet the subject of the source snippet Online Social Networks is omitted being substituted by the pronoun It; also the essential detail with activity is omitted that brings in overgeneralization: the statement refers to all cases of the dysfunctions (server, browser, users' activity, moderators' restrictions, etc.) 7. Oversimplification (distortion severity 5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source snippet: If we accept the current orthodoxy and then blame the Web we offer a technological determinist explanation of reality: technology produces misinformed populations. Simplified snippet: If we accept the current orthodoxy and then blame the Web we have an explanation of reality.</head><p>Comment: Oversimplification appears in the shortened simplified snippets when source utterance is transformed into a trivial statement or even a claim. The simplified snippet claims that we have an explanation of reality thanks to acceptance of the current orthodoxy and accusation of the Web. Meanwhile, the source snippet discusses the technological determinist explanation of reality. The omission of the essential details leads to the oversimplified statement that cannot explain the reality of the technological epoch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Topic shift (distortion severity 5)</head><p>Source snippet: global warming induced by chemtrails or the link between vaccines and autism -find on the Web a natural medium for their dissemination.</p><p>Simplified snippet: The link between vaccines and autism -can be found on the Web a natural medium for changing.</p><p>Comment: Topic shift is revealed in a substitution of the source topic by omitting its part or selecting a wrong basic word to replace the peculiar term in the source. The source snippet lost the essential part of its topic (global warming induced by chemtrails) during the simplification process; moreover, the simplification resulted in the inappropriate syntactic structure of the snippet. 9. Contra sense / contradiction (distortion severity 6)</p><p>Source snippet: In this paper we discuss architectural design issues and trade-offs in connection with our experiences porting our agent-based platform, Opal, to the Sharp Zaurus personal digital assistant (PDA).</p><p>Simplified snippet: The Sharp Zaurus is a personal digital assistant (PDA) developed by Sharp. It is based on the Opal agent-based platform. We discuss architectural design issues and trade-offs in connection with our experiences porting Opal to the Zaurus PDA. Comment: Contradictions in simplified snippets appear due to elimination of essential concepts or interrelations among concepts, omission of significant details, and transformation of the semantic structure of the source snippet. The simplified snippet mentions agent-based platform Opal as the basis for the Sharp Zaurus, but at the same time claims that Opal was ported to the Sharp Zaurus. The source snippet But the new phenomena, the non-agenda ownership, overcome any ideological influence, especially under the conditions of punishment mechanism applied to old politicians lost its semantic structure since the concepts ideological influence and punishment mechanism were eliminated in the process of its simplification. Thus, the simplified snippet But the new phenomena, the ownership of the non-agenda, had a lot of influence on old politicians lacks any explanation how the non-agenda ownership is related to old politicians and why they are influence by the new phenomena. 10. Ambiguity (distortion severity 6)</p><p>Source snippet: The experimental results show that 3D maps with texture on mobile phone display size, and 3D maps without texture on PDA display size are superior to 2D maps in search time and error rate.</p><p>Simplified snippet: 3D maps with texture on mobile phone display size are superior to 2D maps in search time and error rate. The experimental results show that 3D maps without texture on PDA display size were superior to those with texture. The results were published in the journal 3D Maps.</p><p>Comment: Ambiguity presupposes that a statement has several equiprobable interpretations. The instance of the ambiguous simplified snippet in Table X lacks a key to understand whether the 3D maps without texture outperform those with texture or not. Ambiguity often appears due to syntactic simplification of the source. In the source, the clause changes in the strength of competition also reveal key asymmetrical differences is replaced by shorter clause but they do not have any biases that produces ambiguity: whether evidence corresponds to reality or not. The source clarifies the differences between two political parties: Though both Republicans and Democrats show evidence of implicit biases, changes in the strength of competition also reveal key asymmetrical differences however, the simplified snippet doubts the reliability of the evidence: Both Republicans and Democrats show evidence of biases, but they do not have any biases. Readers of the simplified snippet are unable to resolve the ambiguity. 11. Nonsense (distortion severity 7)</p><p>Source snippet: The large availability of user provided contents on online social media facilitates people aggregation around shared beliefs, interests, worldviews and narratives Simplified snippet: The large amount of user provided contents on online social media is called aggregation Comment: The source snippet was transformed into a simple sentence. The transformation brings in erroneous usage of the word aggregation that leads to the loss of meaning of the whole sentence. Instead of the original statement about accessibility of the social or public media on the Web, which facilitates dissemination of fake news and rumors, the simplified snippet claims that there is an opportunity to find a resource to read about fake news and rumors.</p><p>The final ranking for Task 3 was done by the average harmonic mean of normalized opposite values of Lexical Complexity (LC), Syntactic Complexity (SC) and Distortion Level (DL) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="9,238.26,494.44,267.73,28.37">𝑠 𝑖 = 3 7 7-LC + 7 7-SC + 7 7-DL<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="9,230.40,533.08,275.58,46.58">Score = ∑︀ 𝑖 {︃ 𝑠 𝑖 , if No Error 0, otherwise 𝑛<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In Equation <ref type="formula" coords="9,145.93,584.01,3.81,10.91" target="#formula_1">2</ref>, variable 𝑛 refers to the total number of judged snippets and No Error means that the snippet 𝑖 does not have any of Uncorrect syntax, Unresolved anaphora, nor Unnecessary repetition/iteration error.</p></div>

We removed all runs with the 0 score.</p><p>Very interesting partial runs were provided by the HULAT-UC3M team as the generated simplifications provided the explanations of difficult terms. However, HULAT-UC3M's 8 runs over 10 were not in the pool with selected topics. Thus, we provided only automatic evaluation results. The HULAT-UC3M's runs provide clear evidence of the interconnection of tasks 2 and 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper presented the overview of the CLEF 2022 SimpleText Task 3 on simplifying sentences in scientific abstracts, retrieved in response to a queries based on popular science articles.</p><p>We created a corpus of sentences extracted from the abstracts of scientific publications. In contrast to previous work, we evaluate simplification in terms of lexical and syntax complexity combining with error analysis. We introduced a new classification of information distortion types for automatic simplification and we annotated the collected simplifications according to this error classification. Recent pandemics have shown that simplification can be modulated by political needs and the scientific information can be distorted. Thus, in contrast to previous work, we evaluated the simplifications in terms of information distortion.</p><p>For next year, we plan to continue the Task 3 setup, continuing the detailed manual annotations of samples, but also working on automatic metrics that best reflect the insights of this year's analysis. This year, the HULAT-UC3M team submitted runs which combine tasks 2 and 3 which demonstrates strong interconnection of the tasks as often the terminology cannot be removed nor simplified but it needs to be explained to a reader.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,88.99,90.49,220.53,20.87"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>CLEF 2022 SimpleText official run submission statistic</figDesc><table /></figure>
