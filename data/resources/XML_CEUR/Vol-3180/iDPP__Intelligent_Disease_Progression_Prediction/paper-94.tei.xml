<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that typically leads to death within 3-5 years, characterised by a heterogeneous progression across the patient population. This heterogeneity has hindered efforts to assess the efficacy of developmental treatments designed to delay disease progression and prolong survival. As such, prediction of disease progression has been a long-standing interest in the field as a means of enabling better drug development using cheaper, more accurate clinical trials, as well as deriving new and important insights into disease mechanisms and manifestations. So far, this critical point has not yet been sufficiently addressed due to limited access to patient-level data and sophisticated computational tools. This contribution aims at comparing the performance of different baseline machine learning approaches on a common dataset obtained via the integration of different datasets from different countries provided by the challenge organisers. Results show that the ability of different methods across different subtasks to discriminate among subjects at risk and to predict the time of adverse events improves as dynamic variables, monitoring the first six months of patient follow-up, are included as possible predictors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this paragraph, the experimental workflow will be described using the nomenclature used in the iDPP challenge guidelines. The two tasks will be referred to as:</p><p>• Task 1: ranking risk of impairment for ALS; • Task 2: predicting time of impairment for ALS; and the three subtasks as:</p><p>• subtask a: NIV or (competing event) Death, whichever occurs first;</p><p>• subtask b: PEG or (competing event) Death, whichever occurs first; • subtask c: death.</p><p>For each subtask, two types of submission were required:</p><p>• dataset M0: submissions of predictions obtained using only data available until time 0, i.e., the time of the first registered visit or, equivalently, the first available ALSFRS-R questionnaire for each patient; • dataset M6: submissions using data available until month 6.</p><p>A common preprocessing and model-training pipeline was devised and applied to all subtaskspecific datasets provided by the organisers. The following sections document: the preliminary data analysis aimed at evaluating overall data quality (section 3.1.1); the data manipulation steps needed to obtain the final set of static and dynamic input variables (sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3); the differences between the baseline (M0) and progression (M6) datasets as defined by the challenge guidelines (section 3.1.4); the normalisation (section 3.1.6) and imputation (section 3.1.7) procedures; and the model-dependent workflows for training, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimisation via bootstrap resampling (sections 3.1.5, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preprocessing</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Quality Control</head><p>A preliminary data quality analysis was performed to verify that the patient ids were consistent between the provided csv files, that there were no subjects with more than 20% of missing values, and that each subject had at least one ALSFRS-R score measurement. These steps resulted in the exclusion of one subject (id = 0x712eabc24c9a530d1739ada22320183d) whose onsetDate was &gt; 0. A positive onsetDate suggests that the subject had been administered the ALSFRS-R questionnaire before the disease's onset, which appears to be inconsistent with standard clinical practice. Thus, all the recordings related to this subject were removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Static Variables' Preprocessing</head><p>The variable sex was reported as a string with two levels, "male" and "female". It was mapped to a boolean variable such that 0 = "male" and 1 = "female". Similarly, the variables smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, thyroid_disorder, autoimmune_disease, stroke, cardiac_disease, and primary_neoplasm were converted into booleans with values 0/1: missing values were converted to 0 and "TRUE" values to 1.</p><p>In the original version of the datasets, genetic mutations were reported separately for the two clinical centres by which the data were made available. The eight variables lis-bon_FUS_openbox, lisbon_SOD1_openbox, lisbon_TARDBP_openbox, lisbon_C9orf72, turin_FUS, turin_SOD1, turin_TARDBP, and turin_C9orf72_kind were then combined into four boolean variable: FUS, SOD1, TARDBP, and C9orf72.</p><p>The datasets also included detailed information on traumas and surgical interventions, specifying the part of the body involved (head, neck, cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral, cervical spine, thoracic spine, upper limb, lower limb, or abdominal) and the time interval in which the event occurred (denoted by the suffixes _last_5_ years and _more than_5_years). We created two boolean variables trauma_after_onset and surgery_after_onset that were equal to 1 if and only if a subject had had any type of trauma or surgery, respectively, at any time after the onset. The two columns related to traumas and surgical interventions before onset (major_trauma_before_onset, surgical_interventions_before_onset) were kept as in the original version, but they have been renamed to trauma_before_onset and surgery_before_onset, respectively.</p><p>The variable occupation was given as a string with a controlled vocabulary of 41 different levels. This variable was mapped into a new variable, instruction_level, for which the value 1 corresponds to an 8th grade diploma, the value 2 to a high school diploma, the value 3 to a university degree, and the value 4 to a highly specialised or a managerial profile. The implicit assumption, here, was that a patient's current job and the minimum instruction level needed to qualify for that job were tightly correlated.</p><p>Five variables related to onset site were available: onset_bulbar, onset_axial, onset_limbs, onset_generalized, and onset_limb_type. While onset_bulbar and onset_axial are self-explanatory, onset_limbs and onset_generalized are further detailed in the last variable, onset_limb_type. Precisely, if and only if one between onset_limbs and onset_generalized was equal to 1, the same subject also had a value in onset_limb_type, reported as a string with 29 levels. The levels specified the impacted side (left or right), and distinguished between distal/proximal and lower/upper. The first two distinctions were ignored, whereas the third one, being, a priori, the most discriminative, was mapped into two new boolean variables (onset_limb_upper and onset_limb_lower) as follows.</p><p>• If onset_limb_type contained "upper", then onset_limb_upper = 1 and onset_limb_lower = 0; • If onset_limb_type contained "lower", then onset_limb_lower = 1 and onset_limb_upper = 0; • If onset_limb_type contained "upper-lower" or did not contain information on the involved part, then onset_limb_upper = 1 and onset_limb_lower = 1.</p><p>Ultimately, to describe the onset site, onset_limbs and onset_generalized were removed in favour of the two new variables onset_limb_upper and onset_limb_lower, which were maintained together with onset_axial. Onset_bulbar was removed because it was a deterministic function of the other three variables (𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑏𝑎𝑟 = 1 if and only if 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑏_𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟 = 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑏_𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 = 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡_𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑎𝑙 = 0). Three variables specifying motor neuron (MN) prevalence were available: prevalentLMN, prevalentUMN, and mixedMN. At first, we created the variable not_specified_MN, which was equal to 1 when all the other tree MN variables were NAs. Then, we transformed these variables in three dummy variables, removing prevalentLMN, and mantaining prevalentUMN, not_specified_MN, and mixedMN.</p><p>BMI was computed for each patient as 𝐵𝑀 𝐼 = 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡/ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 2 combining the measures of the variables weight and height, which were then removed.</p><p>The variable ethnicity was removed because less than 1% of the observations were different from Caucasian. Moreover, all the variables with more than 70% of missing values were removed: all the twenty variables related to blood tests, retired at diagnosis, packYear, dailyCigarettes, smoking_startYear, smoking_endYear, and alive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Dynamic Variables' Preprocessing</head><p>In addition to the static variables described above, dynamic information was available, allowing for the creation of dynamic variables to capture the changes in patient characteristics over time. Dynamic variables were all in the form of monthly rates of change, between onsetDate and time 0, or, only for dataset M6, between time 0 and the last available visit.</p><p>In the original datasets, two measures of weight (weight and weight_before_onset) were provided. Since weight change is to be considered an indicator of ALS progression <ref type="bibr" coords="6,470.97,175.28,16.55,10.91" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,490.63,175.28,12.42,10.91" target="#b29">30]</ref>, the slope of weight change in kg/month was computed as the angular coefficient of a linear fit between the points (onsetDate; weight_before_onset) and (time0; weight).</p><p>Separate csv files, containing one row for each visit in which a forced vital capacity (FVC) value or an ALSFRS-R score was recorded, were also available.</p><p>The variable fvcValue had 35 -40% of missing values in the three datasets (42% subtask a; 37% subtask b; 38% subtask c). Approximately 40% of patients had one recorded fvcValue, 20% had more than one, and 40% had none. To homogenise this variable across subjects, a single value of FVC per subject was retained according to the following criteria.</p><p>• If the subject had only one value, then it was kept as is.</p><p>• If a subject had more than one value, then the minimum was selected.</p><p>• If a subject had no values, then a value was imputed (more details in section 3.1.7).</p><p>The questions used to compute the ALSFRS-R score can be split into five sub-domains with questions 1 to 3 counting for bulbar impairment, 4 and 5 for upper limbs impairment, 6 and 7 for trunk impairment, 8 and 9 for lower limbs impairment, and 10 to 12 for breathing impairment. For each sub-domain, the questions comprising it were manipulated as follows to obtain three different assessments of the ALSFRS-R score: the score at time 0, the ALSFRS-R slope in the time period between onsetDate and time 0, and the ALSFRS-R slope during the observation time (i.e., between time 0 and month 6).</p><p>1. A virtual visit with the maximum score, equal to 4 for each question and summing to a total of 8 (upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) or 12 (bulbar, breathing), depending on the number of questions in each sub-domain, was added as if there were a visit confirming that the subject did not have ALS before the onset time (hence, the maximum score). 2. The ALSFRS-R score at time 0 was renamed to alsfrs_baseline_&lt;sub-domain&gt;. 3. The slope between the virtual visit at onset time and the visit at time 0 was computed as the angular coefficient of the corresponding linear fit. The resulting variable (slope_baseline_&lt;sub-domain&gt;) was an indicator of the speed of worsening of the patient's condition in each sub-domain between onset and first visit. 4. The slope between the visit at time 0 and the last available visit of each subject within the first six months from time 0 was computed as the angular coefficient of the linear fit over all available visits. The resulting variable (slope_progression_&lt;sub-domain&gt;) was an indicator of the speed of worsening of the patient's condition in each sub-domain during the first 6 months, to be included only in dataset M6. 5. For approximately 20% of the patients, a direct computation of slope_progression_&lt;sub-domain&gt; was not possible, as they did not have multiple visits during the six-months period.</p><p>For those patients, slope_progression_&lt;sub-domain&gt; was set equal to slope_baseline_&lt;sub-domain&gt; under the assumption of a constant deterioration rate before and after the first visit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model Training</head><p>Three survival analysis methods were considered, namely: Cox, SSVM, and RSF. They were chosen to represent a broad spectrum of baseline models including parametric (SSVM), semiparametric (Cox), linear (Cox, SSVM), and nonlinear (RSF) models. The same training workflow, based on feature selection and hyperparameter optimisation was considered for the Cox and SSVM models (section 3.2.1), and an ad-hoc one, leveraging their ability to differentiate variables influence on prediction according to their importance, for the RSF (section 3.2.2). For each subtask, two versions of all models were independently trained, one on dataset M0, and the other on dataset M6. The Cox model and the RSF can only output risk scores, which can be used to address Task 1 by ranking ALS patients according to their risk of impairment, but do not provide a straightforward solution to predicting Task 2's time of impairment. To extend these two methodological approaches to Task 2, the predicted time of impairment for a given patient was selected as the median predicted time to impairment, i.e., the time at which the estimated survival function crossed the 0.5 threshold. Instead, the SSVM can be used either as a ranker or a time regressor depending on how the risk ratio hyperparameter is set during model training.</p><p>Here, the SSVM was initially trained as a time regressor to address Task 2 directly. Then, its predicted times were converted into risk scores in the range [0-1], as requested by the challenge rules, via Platt scaling <ref type="bibr" coords="8,189.73,337.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Cox Model and SSVM Training Workflow</head><p>The same training workflow was used for Cox and SSVM models. For each bootstrap set, an optimal model was obtained by performing hyperparameter optimisation and feature selection. The optimal set of features was obtained using the forward recursive feature selection (FRFS) approach <ref type="bibr" coords="8,132.40,427.85,16.08,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. At each FRFS step, the best feature to be added was chosen as the one that led to the maximum Harrell's concordance index (C-index) on the validation set of the considered bootstrap set. The early stopping criterion for FRFS was a relative variation of the C-index &lt; 0.01%.</p><p>Hyperparameters were optimized using a random search approach <ref type="bibr" coords="8,407.02,482.04,18.07,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref> over 200 possible values. For the Cox model, the only hyperparameter that needed optimisation was the strength of the L2 regularisation (𝛼, randomly sampled from a log-uniform distribution with support [10 -8 -10 3 ]). For the SSVM model, a linear kernel was used and the rank ratio was set equal to 0 so as to obtain a time regression model applicable to both tasks (1 and 2) as explained in section 3.2. The only hyperparameter of the SSVM was the penalisation weight of the squared hinge loss objective function (𝛽, randomly sampled from a log-uniform distribution with support [10 -7 -10 4 ]). For both approaches, the best hyperparameters (i.e., the subset of most important features, the strength of regularisation 𝛼 for the Cox model, and the penalisation weight 𝛽 for the SSVM) were chosen as those that maximised the C-index on the validation set of each bootstrap set.</p><p>The features selected for the optimal models of each bootstrap set were used to obtain the optimal set of features needed to train a single final model. This last set of features was selected based on the average number of FRFS steps at which a variable was added to the set of predictors in the 100 bootstrap sets. If a variable was never selected in a given set, its associated number of steps was set to the maximum number of variables plus one. The final model was then trained on the whole training set using only the variables whose average number of steps was smaller than average. The final model's hyperparameters (𝛼 for the Cox model and 𝛽 for the SSVM) were optimised again via a 10-fold cross validation and a random search approach. The best hyperparameters were chosen as those that led to the maximum cross-validation C-index.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Random Survival Forest Training Workflow</head><p>The workflow used to train the RSF models did not include the feature selection step. Instead, the 100 different bootstrap sets were used to train 100 models, to be used as an ensemble classifier.</p><p>For each bootstrap set, 200 models were trained, varying the combination of two model hyperparameters, i.e., the number of trees to be grown and the maximum depth of each tree. The values tested for the number of trees were randomly sampled in the range [50-750] while the values for the maximum depth were randomly sampled in the range , adding the option "max_depth" (i.e., the longest path between the root node and the leaf node, where a deeper tree means a more complex model). For each bootstrap set, the best hyperparameter combination among the 200 tested was chosen as the one that maximised the C-index on the validation set.</p><p>The obtained 100 independent RSF models were applied to the test set, obtaining 100 predictions for each subject.

The structure of the table is the same described above for Table <ref type="table" coords="10,465.84,494.18,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Model discrimination was, once again, acceptable with C-index values ranging around 0.7 and AUROC values greater than 0.75 for subtask a. Discrimination was better for subtasks b and c, with C-index values over 0.7 and AUROC values around 0.78. Model calibration was good only for long prediction horizons (PHs) (BS &gt; 0.5 with PH = 12 months vs. BS &lt; 0.15 with PH = 60 months).</p><p>Discrimination and calibration improved across all subtasks as dynamic variables were included in the pool of possible predictors (dataset M0 vs. dataset M6). This interesting result suggest that, for ALS, a fast progressing disease, collecting dynamic features for the first 6 months to describe the initial disease progression, instead of just focusing on baseline status, provides a good set of predictors that leads to better predictive power.</p><p>Higher AUROC values were obtained when the prediction horizon (PH) was short (12-18 months) or long (48-60 months). Such an oscillating behaviour was partially expected due to the typical trade-off between PH length and number of recorded events as functions of time. Short PHs are expected to result in increased predictive power, because they are more tightly correlated (at the very least, temporally) with the input data, but, at the same time, might end too close to the start of follow-up for many events to have happened; conversely, longer PHs have a looser link to the input data (and are, thus, harder to predict), but more events are available, generally resulting in a more robust model training.</p><p>The BS decreased as the PH widened. This result was expected as the submitted models were trained without setting an artificial censoring time on the training set, thus leading to a better calibration in the long term, and to a general tendency to overestimate short-term event probability.</p></div>

The models submitted for each one of the three subtasks are reported in the columns of the table. The table is divided in three sections along the rows according to the considered metric: the mean of the absolute values of the distances between predicted and true event time windows (Abs distance) is reported in the first section, the specificity and recall of the predicted time window classification are reported in the second and third sections respectively for each allowed window. The performance of the submitted models was good according to the mean absolute value distance as the predicted event times were, on average, only 7-8 months inaccurate with respect to the true event time. Specificity was high (&gt; 0.7) for all time windows and all models when considering subtasks b and c; while, for subtask a, it was lower than 0.7 for two time windows, confirming the apparently higher difficulty of predicting NIV or death vs. the other challenge endpoints. Finally, recall was low for all models across all subtasks.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="12,126.53,438.80,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the performance metrics of the submitted models for all Task 2 subtasks when using the dataset M6. The structure of the table is the same described above for Table <ref type="table" coords="12,482.58,452.35,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. As observed when considering results obtained using dataset M0, the performance of our submitted models was good according to the mean absolute value distance. The event time prediction was, on average, within 6-7 months with respect to the true event time. Specificity was around 0.8 for all time windows and all models when considering subtasks b and c, meanwhile, for subtask a it was still lower than 0.7 for few time windows. Recall was once again low for all models across all subtasks as our models continued to struggle to correctly classify the time window despite the introduction of dynamic variables.</p><p>In both settings, when considering the extreme time windows (6-12, 30-36, and &gt;36 months), specificity was higher and recall was lower than the corresponding values obtained in central windows (12-18, 18-24, and 24-30 months), which had a higher number of observations. The submitted models had high specificity, but, as evidenced by low recall across the board, correctly identifying the exact time window was quite the challenging task. Nevertheless, as the values obtained when considering the average of the absolute value of distances between predicted and true time windows were low (6-8 months), the predicted time window was not far from the true one. In fact, on average, it was most frequently the previous or following time window, which might be considered an acceptable margin of error from a clinical perspective. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this work, two different approaches to address the two pilot tasks proposed in the iDPP challenge, i.e., ranking patients based on event risk (Task 1) and predicting the time to event (Task 2) for subjects with ALS, were applied. For each task, three different types of event had to be predicted: NIV or Death (if this occurred before NIV), PEG or Death (if this occurred before NIV) and Death, for subtasks a, b, and c, respectively. Particularly, three baseline machine learning techniques for survival analysis (namely, the Cox model, the SSVM and the SRF) were applied to carry out each task. The application of these approaches, widely used in the literature for ALS progression prediction as discussed in Section 2, provided a first comparison of baseline models, including both parametric and semi-parametric, linear and non-linear techniques, on the same dataset and on different types of events. Moreover, for each methodological approach and each task, the prediction ability of the available features was investigated via two different version of the dataset: dataset M0, in which only variables available until the baseline visit are used, and dataset M6, in which also dynamic features are considered, up to 6 months after the baseline.</p><p>Among the three applied approaches, for each subtask the two best performing ones were selected based on the average C-index obtained on the 100 boostrap validation sets. The SSVM was selected for all the subtasks and dataset versions, confirming its versatility to adapt to different prediction problems on ALS. Specifically, in Task 1 it reached good discrimination ability with a C-index of about 0.7 and AUROC between 0.70 and 0.81 in all the subtasks and time windows, while model calibration was good only for long PHs (BS greater than 0.5 for a PH of 12 months and BS lower than 0.08 with a PH equal to 60 months). In Task 2, the SVM yielded an Abs distance between predicted and true time windows of 7-8 months.</p><p>Another notable finding of our analysis was that, for each subtask and model used, performance improved when dynamic features were added as predictors. This is particularly evident looking at Task 1's AUROC and Task 2's Abs distance obtained: the AUROC was always greater than 0.75 (range [0.75-0.82]) when dataset M6 was used, while for dataset M0 it was lower than 0.7 in some cases (range [0.64-0.8]). Similarly, the average Abs distance was in the range <ref type="bibr" coords="14,89.29,127.61,35.81,10.91">[7.4-8.8]</ref> with dataset M0, and <ref type="bibr" coords="14,220.70,127.61,31.84,10.91">[6.8-7.7</ref>] with dataset M6. This highlights the importance of using the first 6 months of data to more accurately determine future impairments in a fast progressing disease such as ALS, instead of just using data collected at the patients' first visit.</p><p>In both Task 1 and Task 2, the models had worse performance in subtask a, compared to subtasks b and c, suggesting a higher difficult in predicting the need for NIV than that of PEG, or only death. This is apparent from Task 1's AUROCs and Task 2's specificities. When considering, e.g., dataset M6, AUROC values were around 0.77 for subtask a (range [0.75-0.79]) and around 0.79 for the other two subtasks (range [0.76-0.82]). Similarly, specificity in subtask a was lower than 0.7 in several time windows in subtask a (range [0.65-0.98]), while around 0.8 in subtasks b and c (range [0.73-0.99]). This might be reasonable being NIV a non-invasive intervention whose timing is based on clinical decision and not only on patient condition. It would be interesting to compare these results with those of other participants to check if the pattern is maintained.</p><p>As stated above, this work constitutes a preliminary comparison of baseline approaches for the prediction of ALS progression. Future works will focus on a wider range of methods, including techniques such as gradient boosting and neural networks. Moreover, it could be interesting to expand the pool of features to include -omics data, to explore their possible effect on model performance. Other possibly ameliorative approaches might be based on patient stratification and the subsequent development of group-specific models.</p><p>We believe that facilitating the stratification of ALS patient populations and predicting the clinical progression of ALS can serve to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms, enable individual patient level prognosis, and improve the success rate of clinical trials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="10,88.99,90.49,417.17,323.09"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Task 1 metrics, datset M0: C-index and AUROC are reported with their estimated value as well as their 95% confidence intervals, only the computed value is reported for the brier score instead</figDesc><table coords="10,94.83,133.64,403.32,279.94"><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">sub-task a</cell><cell cols="2">sub-task b</cell><cell cols="2">sub-task c</cell></row><row><cell>Metric</cell><cell>SSVM</cell><cell>RSF</cell><cell>SSVM</cell><cell>RSF</cell><cell>SSVM</cell><cell>Cox</cell></row><row><cell>C-index</cell><cell>0.652 (0.620-0.683)</cell><cell>0.643 (0.612-0.675)</cell><cell>0.692 (0.664-0.720)</cell><cell>0.690 (0.662-0.717)</cell><cell>0.686 (0.658-0.713)</cell><cell>0.685 (0.658-0.713)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (12m)</cell><cell>0.742 (0.688-0.796)</cell><cell>0.642 (0.610-0.675)</cell><cell>0.768 (0.715-0.822)</cell><cell>0.748 (0.696-0.799)</cell><cell>0.784 (0.731-0.838)</cell><cell>0.760 (0.703-0.817)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (18m)</cell><cell>0.722 (0.668-0.776)</cell><cell>0.696 (0.637-0.755)</cell><cell>0.766 (0.720-0.812)</cell><cell>0.768 (0.722-0.815)</cell><cell>0.748 (0.702-0.795)</cell><cell>0.743 (0.696-0.790)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (24m)</cell><cell>0.720 (0.664-0.775)</cell><cell>0.708 (0.653-0.762)</cell><cell>0.757 (0.711-0.803)</cell><cell>0.741 (0.693-0.790)</cell><cell>0.751 (0.707-0.795)</cell><cell>0.753 (0.709-0.796)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (30m)</cell><cell>0.735 (0.678-0.793)</cell><cell>0.699 (0.643-0.755)</cell><cell>0.771 (0.723-0.818)</cell><cell>0.781 (0.733-0.828)</cell><cell>0.751 (0.706-0.795)</cell><cell>0.749 (0.705-0.794)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (36m)</cell><cell>0.739 (0.681-0.797)</cell><cell>0.730 (0.669-0.790)</cell><cell>0.774 (0.723-0.824)</cell><cell>0.782 (0.732-0.832)</cell><cell>0.751 (0.704-0.798)</cell><cell>0.747 (0.700-0.794)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (48m)</cell><cell>0.746 (0.678-0.815)</cell><cell>0.771 (0.704-0.839)</cell><cell>0.790 (0.731-0.849)</cell><cell>0.807 (0.754-0.860)</cell><cell>0.781 (0.728-0.834)</cell><cell>0.783 (0.731-0.835)</cell></row><row><cell>AUROC (60m)</cell><cell>0.701 (0.612-0.789)</cell><cell>0.779 (0.692-0.866)</cell><cell>0.783 (0.718-0.848)</cell><cell>0.797 (0.737-0.857)</cell><cell>0.785 (0.726-0.844)</cell><cell>0.789 (0.730-0.847)</cell></row><row><cell>BS (12m)</cell><cell>0.580</cell><cell>0.645</cell><cell>0.595</cell><cell>0.705</cell><cell>0.594</cell><cell>0.814</cell></row><row><cell>BS (18m)</cell><cell>0.449</cell><cell>0.499</cell><cell>0.438</cell><cell>0.522</cell><cell>0.479</cell><cell>0.667</cell></row><row><cell>BS (24m)</cell><cell>0.336</cell><cell>0.374</cell><cell>0.330</cell><cell>0.395</cell><cell>0.375</cell><cell>0.525</cell></row><row><cell>BS (30m)</cell><cell>0.260</cell><cell>0.290</cell><cell>0.238</cell><cell>0.282</cell><cell>0.282</cell><cell>0.398</cell></row><row><cell>BS (36m)</cell><cell>0.211</cell><cell>0.234</cell><cell>0.198</cell><cell>0.233</cell><cell>0.229</cell><cell>0.322</cell></row><row><cell>BS (48m)</cell><cell>0.124</cell><cell>0.136</cell><cell>0.126</cell><cell>0.145</cell><cell>0.138</cell><cell>0.190</cell></row><row><cell>BS (60m)</cell><cell>0.080</cell><cell>0.082</cell><cell>0.105</cell><cell>0.119</cell><cell>0.107</cell><cell>0.140</cell></row></table></figure>
