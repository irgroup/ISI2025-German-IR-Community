<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the article we present a comparative evaluation study of three different model agnostic XAI methods, namely SHAP, LIME and AraucanaXAI. The prediction task considered consists in predicting mortality for ALS patients based on observations carried out during a period of 6months. The different XAI approaches are compared according to four quantitative evaluation metrics consisting in identity, fidelity, separability and time to compute an explanation. Furthermore, a qualitative comparison of post-hoc generated explanations is carried out on specific scenarios where the ML model correctly predicted the outcome, vs when it predicted it incorrectly. The combination of the results of the qualitative and quantitative evaluations carried out in the experiment form the basis for a critical discussion of XAI methods properties and desiderata for healthcare applications, advocating for more inclusive and extensive XAI evaluation studies involving human experts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction 1.1 ALS</head><p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive impairment of neurological functions. It causes the paralysis of all voluntary muscles, usually leading to death or respirator-dependence within 3-5 years from onset. The incidence of ALS in Europe and in populations of European descent is 2.6 cases for 100 000 people per year and the prevalence is of 7 cases per 100000 people <ref type="bibr" coords="1,104.84,508.48,11.68,9.88" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.90,508.48,11.61,9.88" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. ALS progression rate and pattern can be highly variable, progressively impairing the ability to move, communicate, swallow, and breathe. The life expectancy is shorter than 3 years for half of the patients, with only 10% surviving for more than 10 years. Currently, there are still no effective treatments that can halt or reverse ALS progression. The heterogeneity in ALS clinical progression and survival makes predicting individual disease outcomes and clinical events very challenging <ref type="bibr" coords="1,279.58,571.78,11.64,9.88" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,298.10,571.78,11.70,9.88" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Nevertheless, predicting ALS progression can improve interventions, clinical practice and patient management. Few predictive models of the ALS progression have been assessed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,215.00,597.04,11.68,9.88" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,233.82,597.04,11.72,9.88" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, identifying predictive variables such as site and age at onset, diagnostic criteria, diagnostic delay, forced vital capacity and progression rate. Even though these models are able to predict individuals' survival or intervention endpoints, there is a lack of tools able to model the entire disease progression over time, considering heterogeneous and longitudinal variables and their relationships. Some preliminary work has been done developing a model based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,160.64,660.28,11.69,9.88" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">BrainTeaser</head><p>The BrainTeaser project aims at leveraging Artificial Intelligence for various aims, including better describing ALS mechanisms, predict disease progression in a probabilistic, time dependent fashion; and suggest interventions that can delay the progression of the disease. By further exploiting the potential of AI, models able to catch and predict disease progression and outcomes over time for stratified cohorts could be used both in the clinical setting to support patient care, or in clinical trials designed to generate in silico patients mimicking sub-populations of subjects with different characteristics. BrainTeaser aims include defining an interpretable end-to-end approach that interpolates temporal data and predicts the probability of an adverse event. Detecting complications during disease progression is of paramount importance for ALS patients and clinicians, and extending predictive models with mechanisms that elucidate which clinical features are important is key to predict and prevent such adverse outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">XAI</head><p>The resurgence of the research trend known as eXplainable AI (XAI) has recently led to the development of methods that complement black-box Machine Learning (ML) models with local and global explanations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.20,268.52,11.69,9.88" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. While global explainability deals with a general understanding of the model classification behavior, local explainability approaches provide insight about the internals of the prediction for a single instance. Local XAI is extremely important in high stakes applications, such as health care, where patients and stakeholders may wish to understand why a particular prediction was made. Furthermore the "right for an explanation" is put forward by regulations, such as the European Union's GDPR2 and <ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.94,331.76,11.64,9.88" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the very recent EU Artificial Intelligence Act <ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.22,331.76,18.31,9.88" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as well as the U.S. government's Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, and the U.S. Department of Defense's Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. Among the several methodologies proposed for post-hoc local explainability, the most frequently used are SHAP and LIME. SHAP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.70,382.34,18.31,9.88" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is a game theoretic approach that delivers local explainability in form of "feature importance" in a single prediction. In particular, given a single instance with its attributes and the predicted probability by the model, SHAP computes Shapley values for each attribute, which represent the contribution of that attribute to the final predicted probability. Therefore, SHAP decomposes the final predicted probability of any machine learning model by assigning a contribution to each feature. On the other hand, LIME locally approximates the behavior of a complex black-box model to that of a simpler and explanable-by-design linear classifier <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.86,458.26,16.88,9.88" target="#b12">[12]</ref>. In case of linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, the local explanation will be the beta regression coefficients of the linear model trained on a neighborhood of the instances whose prediction must be explained. Following the assumption of LIME, other LIME-based approaches have been proposed over the years <ref type="bibr" coords="2,454.98,496.18,16.87,9.88" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,478.48,496.18,16.85,9.88" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. Both SHAP and LIME provide local explanations in terms of local "feature importance". This representation of an explanation may be obscure for a potential user with little background on machine learning analysis, such as clinicians. Motivated by this, we have previously developed an approach, named AraucanaXAI, whose surrogate explainable model consist in decision trees <ref type="bibr" coords="2,504.96,546.82,18.38,9.88" target="#b14">[14]</ref> (https://github.com/detsutut/AraucanaXAI). We believe that decision trees may be more suitable for delivering local explanations, since their structure is easily converted in a chain of if-then rules comprehensible to a wider range of users. Despite the abundance of new XAI methods proposed in the literature, studies have rarely performed a comparison among different approaches, and even less have evaluated their performance using realworld clinical data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.16,622.72,16.88,9.88" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. For this reason, the objective of this research is to perform a comparison, and critical appraisal of SHAP, LIME and AraucanaXAI, on real-world data about ALS patients, coming from a cohort made available by the BrainTeaser project, on the task of predicting mortality based on a set of routinely collected clinical variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Prediction task</head><p>The iDPP CLEF 2022 offers two evaluation tasks focused on predicting the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.70,119.16,16.87,9.88" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.72,119.16,16.82,9.88" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The first task aims at ranking risk of impairment due to ALS, while in the second task participants are required to predict time to a certain impairment-relevant event (i.e., NIV, PEG or death). To evaluate the different XAI approaches on a medical problem, we chose to train different ML classifiers to predict 6-months mortality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Datasets and preprocessing</head><p>Data from 1756 training patients and 494 test patients were available to develop and evaluate the models. We dropped the "alive" feature from the dataset since it is highly correlated with the outcome (discordance in only 2% of the cases) <ref type="foot" coords="3,236.90,220.53,3.51,6.32" target="#foot_0">2</ref> . The covariates provided in the datasets are split into static (e.g. routinely collected demographic and clinical information, as well as specific ALS-related data) and time-dependent variables (i.e. spirometry and ALSFRS-R <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.52,247.64,18.31,9.88" target="#b18">[18]</ref> questionnaire results). Since the observation time for time-dependent variables is restricted to 6-months, the number of time-points only amounted to a single spirometry test, and minimum 1 to maximum 3 questionnaire administrations. For this reason, we used the spirometry result as-is, while we adopted two possible simple approaches for the ALSFRS-R data consisting in a) using just the most recent observation, or b) calculating a slope (i.e. slope=score(time latest ) -score(time 0 )) normalized by the time difference Δt between time 0 and time latest (i.e., slope/Δt). Our experiments showed that the alternative strategies a) or b) did not impact the predictive performance of the algorithms, and the role of time-dependent variables is marginal in the specific prediction task chosen for our study. Also, from the ALSFRS-R results we only kept the original q n score (i.e., 1-4 answer to the single item of the questionnaire) while discarding the cumulative (section and total) scores to avoid co-linearity and high-correlation among features. No further preprocessing of input variables was performed, apart from dropping features with more than 90% of missing values. Additional detailed information about the dataset and the codebook explaining each feature can be found at http://brainteaser.dei.unipd.it/challenges/idpp2022/. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,448.11,412.12,5.49,9.88" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summaries the number of instances in training and test sets, stratified by outcome, to highlight the imbalance of the dataset towards the occurrence of death. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">ML and XAI methods</head><p>We trained a set of 4 well-known classifiers to predict death occurrence: Gradient Boosting (using XGB implementation), Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer perceptron. All the models were implemented through the scikit-learn python package and code is available at https://github.com/detsutut/AraucanaXAI/blob/master/araucana_CLEF_pipeline.ipynb.</p><p>For the XAI methods we have focused our attention on three different methods for post-hoc, modelagnostic, local explainability, selecting SHAP, LIME and AraucanaXAI (ARAU in the following) as they are the ones that provide open-source, Python implementations that are readily available for use by researchers, available through the pip package manager. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Predictive performance</head><p>Since the problem is imbalanced (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,276.61,546.10,3.97,9.88" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we evaluated the performance of the different ML models in terms of balanced accuracy, which is the mean between sensitivity (i.e., the ability to identify positive cases, in this case the outcome "death") and specificity (i.e., the ability to correctly predict negative cases). All the models have low balanced accuracy, between 51% (Random Forest) and 55% (MLP). It is worth to note that we did not fine-tune the parameters (i.e., defaults hyperparameters with no further optimization) or the classification thresholds to try to achieve better classification performance since our aim is not to build a top performing predictive model but rather to evaluate how XAI can support the understanding of the model's behavior. To this end, the instances where the predictive model predicted the "wrong" class as most probable are indeed the most interesting to analyze (see discussion section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">XAI explanations performance</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,99.59,699.90,5.49,9.88" target="#tab_2">2</ref> reports the results of the evaluation of the three different XAI methods when applied to each of the predictive model trained at model development stage. Identity could not be calculated since there are no two identical instances in the test set. In line with previously reported results on an experiment on a different dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="4,170.60,737.88,16.88,9.88" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, results on fidelity show a perfect score for SHAP and ARAU on a slight edge (it was more noticeable in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,215.60,750.54,17.61,9.88" target="#b14">[14]</ref>) compared to LIME. Separability is also consistently low across all XAI methods, with LIME excelling with a perfect score, while ARAU is the worst-performing in terms of separability, albeit with still a very low number of identical explanations originating from different examples. Finally, SHAP is by far the fastest algorithm, with ARAU an order of magnitude slower, and LIME being the slowest (~&gt;100x slower than SHAP). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The quantitative evaluation of the three different XAI methods did not reveal definitive superior performance of one of the approaches, albeit SHAP seems to be the better overall performing algorithm. However, the explainability evaluation metrics are not all that is needed to thoroughly assess the multifaceted construct of what constitutes a "good" explanation in XAI in healthcare. None of these measures indeed considers the fact that explanations, and especially local explanations, are ultimately directed, and should be optimized for, a human expert interacting with the AI system. A human-in-theloop approach has been advocated as essential for the proper evaluation of XAI for healthcare <ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.42,464.26,18.31,9.88" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and concepts like causability (i.e., the integration of "usability" factors and causal reasoning to support explainability) are increasingly recognized as a central component of the quality of generated XAI explanations <ref type="bibr" coords="5,130.34,502.18,16.88,9.88" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>A more qualitatively-oriented analysis of the generated explanations is thus required, moving beyond the standard ML evaluation frameworks consisting of overall performance measures like AUC, sensitivity and specificity, brier score, AUPRC, to dig into the detailed behavior of different XAI methods when dealing with specific, and more relevant, situations: e.g. arguably an explanation would be much more important when the AI-based predictive model and the clinical expert do not agree on the prediction for a specific patient, and the clinician is called to question his expert opinion vs the AI, or rather decide that the AI algorithm simply predicted the wrong outcome. In the supplementary material <ref type="foot" coords="5,108.08,601.61,3.51,6.32" target="#foot_1">3</ref>  Interestingly enough, analyzing such examples, we can highlight some more differences among the XAI methods that the evaluation metrics presented in table 2 did not highlight. These include the fact that a good agreement on the "most important features" that led to the ML model to the correct prediction (suppl fig 1 and 2) exists between SHAP and ARAU, albeit the two methods rely on fundamentally different underlying methodologies (game theory and feature contribution for SHAP vs recursive partitioning of the data space for ARAU), while LIME which is theoretically more similar to ARAU (logistic linear surrogate model vs tree-based surrogate model) presents an explanation where the most important features are ethnicity and onset_bulbar, while the most important features identified by both SHAP and ARAU like onset_date, age_onset and the score of the 7th item of the ALSFRS-R questionnaire appear only later in the list. For what concerns incorrect predictions (suppl. fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,486.95,125.36,5.49,9.88">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="6,514.10,125.36,4.57,9.88" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) it is also interesting to note how ARAU seems to have higher stability of the list of the most important features driving the classification (with onset_date, age_onset and q7 consistently appearing among the first binary splits of the explanation tree) when compared to SHAP's explanation which suggests a decreased importance of onset_date and age_onset in favor of an increased contribution to the incorrect classification of different questionnaire items (e.g. q3, q5, q6 and q9, see suppl fig <ref type="figure" coords="6,435.55,188.60,4.57,9.88" target="#fig_1">4</ref>) and demographic variables like sex, previously deemed unimportant in the cases of correct prediction. LIME also exhibits a similar stability of importance of features in explanations to ARAU, with ethnicity, onset_bulbar and q7 still scoring high importance in the incorrect prediction scenarios.</p><p>Another difference that emerges between ARAU, SHAP and LIME is that, exploiting the passthrough parameters related to the control of pruning of the surrogate explainer tree model (see ARAU's implementation documentation and usage examples, including available hyperparameters, here: https://github.com/detsutut/AraucanaXAI#readme) it is possible to control the complexity of the generated explanation in terms of number of nodes in the explainer tree. Methods that essentially rely on presentation of feature importance like SHAP or LIME do not offer such fine-grained control to the final user, possibly harming the overall effectiveness and usability of the explanation especially in scenarios with a significant number of covariates in the predictive model contributing to the final prediction (i.e. also explainable-by-design models like a logistic regression or a decision tree can quickly become hard to grasp if the dimensionality of the feature space is significantly large. E.g. compare the complexity of an explanation constituted by a single binary-split rule, or a regression with 3 covariates, with one with hundreds of splits or hundreds of odds-ratios or beta coefficients).</p><p>Our study of evaluation of XAI methods in the task of ALS mortality prediction has some limitations that we acknowledge: First of all, we did not optimize the ML models developed to achieve the best possible performance, which in turn affects the proportion of correct and incorrect predictions made by the models and ultimately the XAI explanations generated. Secondly, we overlooked more refined temporal data mining approaches to deal with the time-dependent covariates, which might have been proven useful to predictive performance, especially in a disease like ALS which progresses over time, if tackled with a more refined approach than the simple ones we attempted (see the overarching goals of the BrainTeaser project at: https://brainteaser.health).

That allowed us to re-examine the feature selection performed during preprocessing and to fix the overlooked flaw. This is an example of how explanation facilities can also be employed for model debugging.</p></note>
