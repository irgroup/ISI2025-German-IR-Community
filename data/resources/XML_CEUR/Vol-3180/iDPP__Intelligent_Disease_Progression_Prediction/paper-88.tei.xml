<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ALS is a severe chronic disease characterized by a progressive but variable impairment of neurological functions, characterized by high heterogeneity both in presentation features and rate of disease progression. As a consequence patients' needs are different, challenging both caregivers and clinicians. Indeed, the time of relevant events is variable, which is associated with uncertainty regarding the opportunity of critical interventions like non-invasive ventilation and gastrostomy, with implications on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. For this reason, clinicians need tools able to support their decision in all phases of disease progression and underscore personalized therapeutic decisions.</p><p>The goal of iDPP CLEF is to design and develop an evaluation infrastructure for AI algorithms able to: 1. better indicate intervention time; 2. stratify patients according to their phenotype and rate of disease progression; 3. predict progression rate in a probabilistic, time dependent fashion.</p><p>The participation in iDPP CLEF was satisfactory, hinting at the interest of the community concerning the task. More so, the solutions identified by participants range over several different techniques and provided valid input to such a highly relevant domain as the prediction of the ALS progression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disease that causes the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary muscles, resulting in an increasing impairment of motor and vital functions and leading to death usually within 4-5 years from the diagnosis. Likely resulting from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, ALS is characterized by high heterogeneity in both symptoms and disease progression, especially in the early stages of the disease. This heterogeneity is partly responsible for the lack of effective prognostic tools in medical practice, as well as for the current absence of a therapy able to effectively slow down or reverse the disease course. On the one hand, patients need support for facing the psychological and economic burdens deriving from the uncertainty of how the disease will progress; on the other, clinicians require tools that may assist them throughout the patient's care, recommending tailored therapeutic decisions and providing alerts for urgently needed actions. In order to improve the current diagnostic and prognostic situation, we should design and develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms be able to:</p><p>‚Ä¢ stratify patients according to their phenotype, assessed all over the disease evolution;</p><p>‚Ä¢ predict the progression of the disease in a probabilistic, time dependent fashion;</p><p>‚Ä¢ better describe disease mechanisms.</p><p>The Intelligent Disease Progression Prediction at CLEF (iDPP CLEF) lab<ref type="foot" coords="2,415.37,372.82,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> aims to design and develop an evaluation infrastructure for driving the development of such AI algorithms. By "evaluation infrastructure", we mean experimental collections, evaluation protocols, evaluation measures, ground-truth creation protocols, and so on. Indeed, in this context, it is fundamental, even if not so common yet, to develop shared approaches, promote the use of common benchmarks, foster the comparability and replicability of the experiments. Differently from previous challenges in the field, iDPP CLEF addresses in a systematic way some issues related to the application of AI in clinical practice in ALS. Therefore, in addition to defining the risk scores based on the probability that an event will occur in the short or long term period, iDPP CLEF also addresses the issue of providing information in a more structured and understandable way to clinicians.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related challenges; Section 3 describes its tasks; Section 4 discusses the developed dataset; Section 5 explains the setup of the lab and introduces the participants; Section 6 introduces the evaluation measures adopted to score the runs; Section 7 analyzes the experimental results for the different tasks; finally, Section 8 draws some conclusions and outlooks some future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creation of the datasets</head><p>The full dataset contained approximately 4,800 records linked to patients, with around 20,000 ALSFRS-R questionnaires in total and 5,500 records concerning spirometries. The original data contain minor inconsistencies and typos. Therefore, we first process the data, removing records that are likely wrong or do not provide essential information to enable prediction. In terms of patient records we removed those presenting an unordered sequence of events (i.e., onset after diagnosis or diagnosis after death). Such event sequences are likely due to typos and other human errors, which result in wrong records that might introduce noise and spurious information in the final dataset.</p><p>Furthermore, a patient record was dropped if one or more of the following pieces of information were absent:</p><p>‚Ä¢ onset or diagnosis dates;</p><p>‚Ä¢ death date in records associated with dead patients;</p><p>‚Ä¢ at least six months of historical ALSFRS-R questionnaires before an event (NIV, PEG, or (competing event) Death). We adopt the filtering strategy mentioned above to grant that every record in the final dataset contains enough information to allow proper predictions.</p><p>Concerning the ALSFRS-R questionnaires, we removed those records that had one or more of the following problems:</p><p>‚Ä¢ duplicate records;</p><p>‚Ä¢ missing date;</p><p>‚Ä¢ one or more of the ALSFRS-R items missing;</p><p>‚Ä¢ ALSFRS-R reporting only the old 10 ùë°‚Ñé item. Furthermore, if one or more of the ALSFRS-R sub-scores or the total ALSFRS-R score do not agree with the sum of the associated ALSFRS-R items, we replace the value reported in the original dataset with the sum of the linked items. Finally, regarding the spirometries, we removed duplicated records, records with a missing date, and FVC percentage value.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,130.61,265.17,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates a set of -synthetic -patients and their clinical history, describing whether they satisfy the conditions to be inserted into the dataset. By construction, the first ALSFRS visit (blue bullets) is considered as Time 0, while the moment of the previous spirometries (yellow bullets) and subsequent visits is indicated as the difference in months with respect to the reference ALSFRS.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Patient 1 is inserted into the dataset, having a proper sequence of visits, questionnaires and events (at least six months of information before the first event).</p><p>‚Ä¢ Patient 2, on the other hand, cannot be included in the dataset since they do not have enough information.</p><p>‚Ä¢ For Patient 3, we observe that only four months passed between the first ALSFRS and the first event. Thus, even though we have 6 months of overall information (first spirometry to event), we cannot retain the record.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Patient 4, regardless of the fact that they have a single ALSFRS, can be included in the dataset since the distance between the first ALSFRS and the event is above six months.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Both patients 5 and 6 need to be excluded from further analyses: the former does not have six months of information before the first event, while the latter does not have enough history, regardless of the spirometry taken before the first ALSFRS.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Patients 7 and 8, on the other hand, can be considered: the former has a proper clinical history, while the latter, even though they have a "censored" event, has more than six months of history.</p><p>Out of the 2559 original valid patient records, 2250 contained at least 6 months of information. Nevertheless, it is not possible to put all the patients on all the datasets. Assume for example a patient that underwent a NIV intervention at month 5. The record associated with such patient cannot be considered feasible for the Dataset A: it does not contain at least 6 months of information before the outcome. Nevertheless, if the very same patient undergoes a PEG event at month 7, the patient can be considered feasible to Dataset B (and therefore to Dataset C). Table 3 reports the number of valid patients present in each dataset, with the count of the labels that characterize them. Dataset A is the least populated: an NIV procedure is often required quite early in the course of the disease, and thus, for a large group of patients (755), it happened before six months of follow-up. Thus we were forced to exclude them since not enough information was available in those cases. We observe that dataset B contains 2145 individuals (414 were discarded). We observe an increase in the number of individuals considered suitable for this dataset: it is more likely that a PEG will be necessary much later in the progression of the disease, and thus more patients accrue more than six months of data before the outcome. Notice that patients that were labelled as NIV in dataset A, if they are suitable to enter dataset B (meaning that has at least six months of information before the PEG), can be labelled as either PEG, DEATH or NONE in the case they did not undergo any events other than the NIV for which they entered dataset A. Conversely, patients labelled as DEATH can either be labelled with PEG, in case they received a PEG after six months from the first ALSFRS-R and before their death, or DEATH in case they did not, but they cannot switch to class NONE. The converse is also true if we consider the relationship between datasets B and A. Finally, dataset C contains 2250 patients, with only 305 records discarded. Given the criteria used to construct Dataset C, it contains patients present in datasets A and B. Patients that received an NIV or a PEG after six months from the first ALSFRS-R have at least six months of information before their death. We also include new patients: those that had an NIV before six months from the first ALSFRS-R and those that had a PEG before six months but survived (or died) more than six months after the first ALSFRS-R. Patients that were not included in dataset C are those that survived less than six months after the first ALSFRS-R.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0.1.">NIV and Death</head><p>Concerning dataset A (NIV, Death or Censoring Events), we observe that 1804 patients satisfy the conditions to be included in the dataset (6 months of data between the first ALSFRS-R and the event). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,132.67,522.52,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_3">4</ref> reports the distribution of patients with respect to the distance from the event. We notice a very steep distribution, suggesting that the events often happen before month 6. Compared to Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,180.42,549.62,5.04,10.91">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,238.07,549.62,8.31,10.91" target="#fig_7">10</ref>, we argue that the NIV is the most likely event in the first six months. Both Figures 7 and 10 present a lower peak in the first part of the distribution.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,130.95,576.72,9.95,10.91" target="#fig_4">5a</ref> reports the number of visits, according to their type, with respect to the time from the reference ALSFRS-R questionnaire. We notice a predictable increase in the number of visits with respect to the months passed since the diagnosis. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,359.69,603.82,10.24,10.91" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> illustrates the number of visits associated with each feasible patient that was included in the dataset. Interestingly, we notice that the mean number of visits in the considered six months is 3.3, with a slightly lower median number.</p><p>Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,167.54,658.01,3.81,10.91">6</ref>. reports the number of patients incurring in a certain event for dataset A. Among patients included in dataset A, 788 are labelled with the event DEATH, 837 with the event NIV and 179 patients are labelled with NONE, which indicates the censoring event. If a patient incurred both NIV and Death, the event associated with that patient that needs to be predicted is only the NIV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEATH</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0.2.">PEG and Death</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,119.41,603.08,3.66,10.91">7</ref>. reports the distribution of the distance to the event if we consider as feasible events the PEG, Death or the censoring event. As we noticed with the number of subjects that belong to each dataset, for what concerns dataset B, we have fewer subjects that have less than 6 months between their first ALSFRS-R and the event. In particular, we are able to accrue 2145 suitable subjects for this dataset. Following what we observed for dataset A, we report the number of visits according to their distance from the first ALSFRS-R (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,272.33,468.88,8.83,10.91">8a</ref>) as before, we notice an increase in the number of visits with the months passing. In this case, as Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,330.77,482.43,8.66,10.91">8b</ref>. illustrates, we have on average 3.35 visits for each patient, with the vast majority of patients having between 2 and 3 visits.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,130.53,509.53,4.97,10.91">9</ref> exhibits the distribution of events in dataset B. Differently from dataset A, where the most common event was the NIV (the focus of the subtask) in this case, the most common event is DEATH. This indicates a generally increased probability of incurring death before receiving a PEG. From the perspective of an AI practitioner, it also indicates that models that were suited to task A are likely not usable trivially on this second dataset but would require a specific tuning in order to be applied on this second scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.0.3.">Death and Censoring events</head><p>The final dataset, dataset C, concerns the death and censoring events and it is used in the tasks that require predicting such events. As shown by Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,384.43,640.15,8.53,10.91" target="#fig_7">10</ref>. for what concerns the number of patients included in this dataset, we overcome both dataset A and dataset B: several patients that did not have the right features to be considered feasible before (at least 6 months  of information from the first ALSFRS-R) can be included in this dataset. Dataset C counts 2250 records associated with as many patients.</p><p>Similarly to the previous datasets, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,288.10,488.40,10.35,10.91" target="#fig_8">11</ref> illustrates the distribution of the visits, either with respect to the timespan or to the patients. As for the previous case, we have 3.35 visits per patient on average, with the mode on 3 visits and approximately 50% of the patients having between 2 and 3 visits.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,130.78,542.60,9.97,10.91" target="#fig_9">12</ref> illustrates how events distribute in dataset C. We have more deaths than censoring events. This is expected: historical data regards patients with ages up to more than 90 years followed sometimes for several years. As mentioned before, 1903 patients overwent the death event, while 347 incurred into the censoring event. Notice that, in this case, we have more censoring events than for what concerns previous datasets, since patients that incurred NIV and/or PEG but survived are considered suitable for the censoring event in this case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Split into training and test</head><p>Each of the three available datasets (sub-task a, b, and c) was split into a training set and a test set, with proportions 80% and 20%, respectively. The data were split stratifying the subjects according to outcome time and to the specific outcome type (i.e., death, NIV, none for sub-task a, death, PEG, none for sub-task b, and death, none for sub-task c). Stratifying by these two variables is instrumental to the fairness of the challenge as it forces an equal distribution of their levels across the two subsets. The simplest method to verify whether stratification has yielded a satisfactory split is to compare the distributions of the stratification variables (outcome time and outcome type) in each training/test pair. From the literature, certain variables are known to be particularly relevant for predicting events related to ALS progression <ref type="bibr" coords="15,419.60,429.99,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, therefore, even though they were not included in the stratification criteria, sex, age at onset, onset site, ALSFRS-F slope, and the number of available visits in the first 6 months were also verified to be equally represented in the training and test sets. Tables <ref type="table" coords="15,298.35,470.64,7.32,10.91" target="#tab_7">4,</ref><ref type="table" coords="15,308.36,470.64,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_8">5</ref>, and 6 report the variables' distributions for sub-task a, b, and c, respectively: the second column reports the distribution in the training sets and the third column in the test sets. Note that outcome time is measured in months from time 0, i.e., the first registered ALSFRS-R visit, while age at onset is measured in years. Since the distributions were similar, the training/test split provided to the participants met best-practice quality standards.</p><p>The distributions of the two variables used to stratify are also represented in Figures 13, 14 and 15 via bar plots for categorical variables (i.e., outcome types), and density plots for continuous variables (i.e., outcome time).      </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Pilot Task 1: Ranking Risk of Impairment</head><p>The runs submitted for Task 1 were evaluated by means of Harrel's concordance index (C-index) <ref type="bibr" coords="23,89.29,404.49,11.53,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) <ref type="bibr" coords="23,397.39,404.49,16.36,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and the Brier score (BS) <ref type="bibr" coords="23,110.07,418.04,16.33,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The 95% confidence intervals of the C-index and the AUROC were also considered <ref type="bibr" coords="23,89.29,431.59,16.25,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The C-index has an advantage over the other considered metrics (i.e., AUROC and BS) in that it can be used to evaluate model discrimination on the test sets regardless of censored data. According to the best practices in the field <ref type="bibr" coords="23,311.56,472.24,16.42,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, before computing the C-index, a final censoring time equal to the last time-to-event in the training was set on each test set. This ensured consistency between Task 1's final results and those that might have been obtained by the participants during model development.</p><p>The AUROC and BS were computed at various prediction horizons (PHs). Specifically, seven clinically relevant PHs were considered, namely: 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 months after the baseline. For each PH, the corresponding version of the test set comprised: all patients who experienced an event before the PH, and all patients who experienced an event or were censored after the PH as censored patients (and were, thus, censored at that PH). As the status of patients censored before the PH was, by definition, unknown, they were excluded from performance evaluation at that PH.</p><p>To contextualize the results obtained by the participants, each run was compared to the empirical lower bound established by the average performance of 100 random classifiers (i.e., such that their output was a random continuous number, uniformly sampled in the range [0, 1]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Pilot Task 2: Predicting Time of Impairment</head><p>To evaluate the predictions of Task 2, the selected evaluation metrics were: the specificity, the recall, and a measure of distance between the predicted and correct time intervals.</p><p>Confusion matrices were computed to derive specificity, i.e., the number of correct negative predictions divided by the total number of negatives, and recall, i.e., the ratio of correct positive predictions over the total predicted positives. Two types of confusion matrix were computed to evaluate two possible prediction goals: time interval prediction approach and label prediction approach.</p><p>For the time interval prediction approach the outcome times reported in the column Time of the published test sets were mapped to the corresponding interval ("6-12", "12-18", "18-24", "24-30", "30-36", or "&gt;36" months). A conformance check was performed on the participants' predicted times: predictions in the time interval "0-6" were reassigned to the interval "6-12", i.e., the closest allowed interval. The confusion matrices reported the predicted time interval vs the true time interval, independently of the predicted event.</p><p>In the label prediction approach, maintaining the outcome time mapped as above, goodness of prediction was assessed by fixing the observation time to each time interval and evaluating the predicted label vs the true label. Let true_label be the label reported for the subject in the column Type of the published test sets, this_interval_label the corresponding label used in the confusion matrix of a specific time interval, true_time_interval the time interval in which the outcome happens, observation_time the time interval under evaluation, predicted_label the label predicted by the participants, this_interval_predicted_label the predicted label for the specific time interval, and predicted_time_interval the time interval in which the participants predicted the outcome. Then, the ground truth was constructed as follows.</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_label = "NONE", then this_interval_label = "NONE";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval &gt; observation_time, then this_interval_label = "NONE";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval &lt; observation_time, then this_interval_label = "CENSORED";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval = observation_time and true_label = "NIV", then this_interval_label = "NIV";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval = observation_time and true_label = "PEG", then this_interval_label = "PEG";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval = observation_time and true_label = "DEATH", then this_interval_label = "DEATH";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if true_time_interval = observation_time and true_label = "CENSORED", then this_interval_label = "CENSORED".</p><p>Similarly, the predicted labels were remapped as follows.</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_label = "NONE", then this_interval_predicted_label = "NONE";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval &gt; observation_time, then this_interval_predicted_label = "NONE";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval &lt; observation_time, then this_interval_predicted_label = "CEN-SORED";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval = observation_time and predicted_label = "NIV", then this_interval_predicted_label = "NIV";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval = observation_time and predicted_label = "PEG", then this_interval_predicted_label = "PEG";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval = observation_time and predicted_label = "DEATH", then this_interval_predicted_label = "DEATH";</p><p>‚Ä¢ if predicted_time_interval = observation_time and predicted_label = "CENSORED", then this_interval_predicted_label = "CENSORED".</p><p>This manipulation allowed a fair comparison of the predicted label vs the true label for each interval, actualized in comparing this_interval_label and this_interval_predicted_label.</p><p>Furthermore, a measure of distance between the predicted and correct time intervals, in months, was also considered (AbsDist). To compute the AbsDist, all the time intervals were replaced with the mean value of each interval (i.e., "6-12" was replaced with 9, "12-18" with 15, "18-24" with 21, "24-30" with 27, "30-36" with 33, and "&gt;36" with 39). The difference between the predicted values and the true values was then computed as ùëöùëíùëéùëõùëâ ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí ùëùùëüùëíùëëùëñùëêùë°ùëíùëë ùë°ùëñùëöùëí ùëñùëõùë°ùëíùëüùë£ùëéùëô -ùëöùëíùëéùëõùëâ ùëéùëôùë¢ùëí ùë°ùëüùë¢ùëí ùë°ùëñùëöùëí ùëñùëõùë°ùëíùëüùë£ùëéùëô . The obtained differences were, by construction, in the range [-36; +36] where a smaller modulus corresponds to more accurate predictions. Negative values correspond to a events that occur before the predicted time and positive values to events that occur after. Finally, the AbsDist was obtained by averaging the differences absolute values.</p><p>To contextualize the results obtained by the participants, each run was compared to the performance of several synthetic runs, with the following characteristics:</p><p>‚Ä¢ min_interval: a run in which the predicted time intervals are identical for all subjects, and fixed at the first possible time interval, i.e. "6-12";</p><p>‚Ä¢ max_interval: a run in which the predicted time intervals are identical for all subjects, and fixed at the last possible time interval, i.e. "&gt;36";</p><p>‚Ä¢ interval_18_24: a run in which the predicted time intervals are identical for all subjects, and fixed at the time interval "18-24";</p><p>‚Ä¢ random_interval: 100 randomly generated runs, but with the same distribution as the test set distribution (i.e., such that their output was sampled among the labels "6-12", "12-18", "18-24", "24-30", "30-36", "&gt;36" following the same distribution of the true intervals);</p><p>‚Ä¢ inverse_distr_interval: 100 randomly generated runs, but with an inverse distribution compared to the test set distribution (i.e., such that their output was sampled among the labels "6-12", "12-18", "18-24", "24-30", "30-36", "&gt;36" following the inverse distribution of the true outcome);</p><p>‚Ä¢ corr_interval: 100 correlated runs, with correlation coefficient to the true intervals ‚àº 0.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Results</head><p>For each task, we report here the analysis of the performance attained by the runs submitted by the Lab's participants according to the metrics described in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Pilot Task 1: Ranking Risk of Impairment for ALS</head><p>We first determine the performance of the submitted runs in terms of C-index. As expected, the random classifiers yielded an average C-index of around 0.5 in each sub-task. Runs submitted by the BioHit team were comparable to those obtained by the random classifiers when considering sub-tasks a and b, meanwhile they were slightly better than random when considering sub-task c. In all three sub-tasks, runs submitted by other participants significantly outperformed the random classifiers with the CampBioMed team leading the pack (max C-index &gt; 0.725). The complete list of figures concerning the c-index is available in Appendix A. Secondly, we evaluate the submissions in terms of AUROC. The AUROC confirmed the results obtained when considering the C-index. Again, as expected, the random classifiers yielded an AUROC of around 0.5. Runs submitted by the BioHit team showed a discrimination that was comparable to the one of the random classifiers, and all runs submitted by other participants significantly outperformed the random classifiers. The CampBioMed and SBB teams obtained the best results when all the information available in the first 6 months was considered (M6 runs).</p><p>Across all sub-tasks, higher AUROC values were obtained when the PH was short (12-18 months) or long (48-60 months). This behaviour is mostly due to the trade-off between PH length and number of events at various time points. Short PHs tend to lead to increased predictive power as they are tightly correlated with the input data, however, they might be too close to the start of follow-up for many events to have been observed; on the contrary, longer PHs have a weaker link to the input data (harder to predict), but more events are available, leading to a more robust model training. The complete evaluation of the submitted runs in terms of AUROC is available in Appendix B.</p><p>Overall, model discrimination was acceptable, with C-index and AUROC values around 0.7 for all submitted models across all sub-tasks. Participants' runs performed better in sub-task b (prediction of PEG or death) than in the other sub-tasks according to all discrimination metrics.</p><p>As a final anylsis concerning pilot task 1, we compute the BS for the runs submitted for all the sub-tasks. The random classifier yielded a BS of around 0.325 regardless of the considered PH and sub-task as the random probability values were, on average, always well distributed in the range [0, 1]. Runs submitted by the CampBioMed team showed the best calibration at short PHs (12-24 months), while those submitted by the SBB team showed the worst one, mainly due to a consistent overestimation of the event probability. Other participants' runs, when considering a short PH, led to BS values that were comparable with those obtained by the random classifiers, as their models neither accurately predict the event probability, nor showed consistent underor overestimation trends. Some runs submitted by the CampBioMed team, which had good calibration with a short PH, led to a poorer calibration at longer PHs (48-60 months). All other runs submitted by the participants significantly outperformed the random classifiers at 48-60 months by showing good calibration, with the SBB team leading the pack.</p><p>Overall, calibration was comparable across different sub-tasks. Instead, for most submitted runs, the BS decreased as the PH widened. This result suggest that the submitted models were trained without setting an artificial censoring time on the training set, leading to a better calibration in the long term, and an overestimation of short-term event probability. For most submitted runs, discrimination and calibration improved across all sub-tasks as dynamic variables were considered (M0 vs. M6), suggesting that, for ALS, collecting dynamic features for the initial six months, instead of using baseline features only, is likely to lead to better performance in describing disease progression. Results achieved by iDPP CLEF participants in terms of BS is available in Appendix C.</p><p>Overall, for Task 1, runs submitted by the CampBioMed team were the best performing across the board; meanwhile, runs submitted by the BioHit team led to the lowest discrimination, but still yielded acceptable calibration at long PHs. Finally, the SBB and LIG GETALP teams obtained comparable results when considering runs obtained using all the information available in the first 6 months (M6 runs); meanwhile, when using only the information available at time 0 (M0 runs), runs submitted by the SBB team showed worse discrimination than those submitted by the LIG GETALP team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Pilot Task 2: Predicting Time of Impairment for ALS</head><p>Appendix D and Appendix E contain respectively the specificity-recall plots for the time interval and the label prediction approaches.</p><p>The graph shows the specificity on the x-axis (from 1 to 0, left to right), and the recall on the y-axis (from 0 to 1, bottom to top). The ideal classifier would have specificity = 1 and recall = 1, and would therefore be located in the upper left corner: as a general guidance, the closer a run to the upper left corner, the better the classification obtained.</p><p>In all graphs, the synthetic runs with constant predictions (set to the minimum or maximum time interval) are located in the corners of the plot, depending on the time interval. As expected, the 100 runs with 70% correlation always form a cloud in the upper left corner, while the 200 randomly generated runs, 100 with the same distribution and 100 with the inverse distribution always remain in the lower left sector, with 1 &gt; ùë†ùëùùëíùëêùëñùëì ùëñùëêùëñùë°ùë¶ &gt; 0.5 and 0 &gt; ùëüùëíùëêùëéùëôùëô &gt; 0.5.</p><p>Across the different time intervals and the three sub-tasks, there is no homogeneity of performance among the participants. Overall, the two best performing teams were CompBioMed and FCOOL, outperformed in a few cases by SBB team.</p><p>There is a great variety of results across sub-tasks and observation times. It is always true that predicting the label none lead to a higher recall, compared to the prediction of NIV, PEG, and death. The best performing teams were, once again, CompBioMed and FCOOL.</p><p>Finally, we evaluate the AbsDist for all runs submitted for sub-tasks a, b and c. As expected, the max_interval run led to the worst result across all tasks, as most subjects' true time interval is smaller than the maximum one. Runs random_interval, min_interval, and inverse_corr_interval led to comparable distance values. Runs submitted by the BioHit team had AbsDist values comparable with the synthetic run interval_18_24, suggesting that their models might predict the average time interval for most subjects in all sub-tasks. All runs submitted by the other teams significantly outperformed the aforementioned synthetic runs with the CampBioMed and SBB teams leading the pack when considering sub-task a, and sub-tasks b and c, respectively. Finally, the corr_interval synthetic run led to the smallest AbsDist value. Note, however, that this run was included only as an arbitrary reference to represent an excellent model, and its distance value was not strictly expected to be reached by any participant. AbsDist computed for all runs submitted can be found in Appendix F.</p><p>Predicting the correct event time interval proved to be a challenge for all teams, especially in terms of recall. However, almost all teams were able to obtain good AbsDist values as, on average, their models, despite not being able to precisely identify the correct time interval, tended to predict an interval that was immediately before or after the true one.</p><p>As observed for Task 1, runs performed better when considering all the information available in the first 6 months (M6 runs) rather than only the information available at time 0 (M0 runs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Approaches</head><p>In this section, we provide a short summary of the approaches adopted by participants in iDPP CLEF. There are two separate sub-sections, one for Task 1 and 2 focused on ALS progression prediction and the other for Task 3, on eXplainable AI (XAI) approaches for such kind of algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task 1 and 2</head><p>BoiHIT explored the use of logistic regression, random forest classifiers, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Decision trees and boosting approaches were preferred due to their ability to deal with both categorical and numerical/continuous features and the interpretability they offer. Even if LightGBM was the model with the best performance, BoiHIT found out that this kind of approaches might not be appropriate for time dependent problems and that time to event analysis methods, such as survival analysis, might yield better results.</p><p>CompBioMed <ref type="bibr" coords="28,163.63,429.91,12.76,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> considered three main approaches. The simplest one consisted on fitting a standard survival predictor separately for each event as outlined above for independent events, called Naive Multiple Event Survival (NMES). Another was the recently developed Deep Survival Machine (DSM), based on deep learning and capable of handling competing risks. Finally, they also proposed a time-aware classifier ensemble method, that also handles competing risks, called Time-Aware Classifier Ensemble (TACE). All the above approaches achieved comparable performance among them. Only the TACE models appeared to be slightly worse than the rest in when using 6 months of data. Moreover, no clear advantage of the DSM models, that specifically handles competing risks, was observed with respect to the NMES models, which treat all events, as if they were independent.</p><p>FCOOL <ref type="bibr" coords="28,135.81,565.40,12.72,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposes a hierarchical approach, with a first-stage event prediction, followed by specialized models predicting the time window to a particular event. The procedure is three-fold: first, it creates patient snapshots based on clustering with constraints, thus organizing patient records in an efficient manner. Second, it uses a pattern-based approach that incorporates recent advances on temporal pattern mining to the context of classification. This approach performs end-stage event prediction while allowing the entire patient's medical history to be considered. Finally, exploiting the predictions from the previous step, specialized models are learned using the original features to predict the time window to an event. This two-stage prediction approach aimed to promote homogeneity and lessen the impact of class imbalance, in comparison to performing one single multilabel task.</p><p>LIG GETALP <ref type="bibr" coords="29,158.85,114.06,12.68,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> employed Cox's proportional hazards model to the task of ranking the risk of impairment, using the gradient boosting learning strategy The output of the time-independent part of the survival function calculated by the gradient boosting survival analysis method is then mapped to the interval (0, 1), via a sigmoid function. To estimate the time-to-event, LIG GETALP used a regression model based on Accelerated Gradient Boosting (AGB). This being a standard regression model, it does not take censoring into account and Mannion et al. uses class predictions based on the Task 1 survival model to "censor" the time-to-event predictions.</p><p>SBB <ref type="bibr" coords="29,122.00,208.91,13.00,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> considered three survival analysis methods, namely: Cox, SSVM, and RSF. They were chosen to represent a broad spectrum of baseline models including parametric (SSVM), semiparametric (Cox), linear (Cox, SSVM), and nonlinear (RSF) models. The Cox model and the RSF can only output risk scores, which can be used to address Task 1 by ranking ALS patients according to their risk of impairment, but do not provide a straightforward solution to predicting Task 2's time of impairment. To extend these approaches to Task 2, the predicted time of impairment for a given patient was selected as the median predicted time to impairment, i.e., the time at which the estimated survival function crossed the 0.5 threshold. Instead, the SSVM can be used either as a ranker or a time regressor depending on how the risk ratio hyperparameter is set during model training. Here, the SSVM was initially trained as a time regressor to address Task 2 directly. Then, its predicted times were converted into risk scores in the range [0-1], as requested by the challenge rules, via Platt scaling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task 3</head><p>Nunes et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,141.83,407.28,12.84,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposes a novel approach that generates semantic similarity-based explanations for patient-level predictions. The underlying idea is to explain the prediction for one patient by considering aspect-oriented semantic similarity with other relevant patients based on the most important features used by ML approaches or selected by users. To build rich and easy to understand semantic-similarity based explanations, Nunes et al. developed five steps: (1) the enrichment of the Brainteaser Ontology <ref type="bibr" coords="29,264.38,475.02,17.75,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> through integration of other biomedical ontologies;</p><p>(2) the semantic annotation of patients (if not already available); (3) the similarity calculation between patients; (4) selection of the set of patients to explain a specific prediction; and (5) the visualization of the generated similarity-based explanations.</p><p>Buonocore et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="29,172.22,529.22,17.91,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> trained a set of 4 well-known classifiers to predict death occurrence: Gradient Boosting (using XGB implementation), Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer perceptron. For the XAI methods Buonocore et al. focused our attention on three different methods for post-hoc, model-agnostic, local explainability, selecting SHAP, LIME and AraucanaXAI. Then, Buonocore et al. evaluated and compared XAI approaches in terms of a set of metrics defined in previous research on XAI in healthcare: identity: if there are two identical instances, they must have the same explanations; fidelity: concordance of the predictions between the XAI surrogate model and the original ML model; separability: if there are 2 dissimilar instances, they must have dissimilar explanations; time: average time required by the XAI method to output an explanation across the entire test set. The quantitative evaluation of the three different XAI methods did not reveal definitive superior performance of one of the approaches, albeit SHAP seems to be the better overall performing algorithm. However the explainability evaluation metrics are not all that is needed to thoroughly assess the multifaceted construct of what constitutes a "good" explanation in XAI in healthcare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>iDPP CLEF is a new pilot activity focusing on predicting the temporal progression of ALS and on the explainability of the AI algorithms for such prediction.</p><p>We developed 3 datasets containing anonymized patient data from two medical institutions, one in Turin and the other in Lisbon, for the prediction of NIV, PEG, or death.</p><p>Out of 43 registered participants, 5 managed to submit a total of 120 runs, evenly spread across the offered tasks. Participants adopted a range of approaches, including various types of survival analysis, also using deep learning techniques. For the XAI of the prediction algorithms they used both semantic-similarity based techniques and state-of-art post-hoc and model-agnostic XAI approaches.</p><p>For this initial iteration of the lab, iDPP CLEF focus on ALS progression prediction. Possible, future cycles will be extended to Multiple Sclerosis (MS), another chronic disease, impairing neurological functions. Moreover, we plan to extend the datasets to also include data from environmental sensor, e.g. concerning pollution.    Figures 19 to 39 show the AUROC with its 95% confidence intervals computed for all runs submitted for sub-tasks a, b, and c at all the considered PHs (12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 months). The average AUROC of the 100 random classifiers is reported in the the last row of the figures.                                           </p></div>
