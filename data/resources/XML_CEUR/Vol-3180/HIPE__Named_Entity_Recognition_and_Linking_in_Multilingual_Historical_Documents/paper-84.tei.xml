<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper summarizes the participation of the L3i laboratory of the University of La Rochelle in the Identifying Historical People, Places, and other Entities (HIPE) evaluation campaign of CLEF 2022 in both tasks: named entity recognition and classification (NERC), coarse-and fine-grained, and entity linking (EL) in historical newspapers and classical commentaries. For both tasks, we developed models based on our previous models, which ranked first at CLEF-hipe-2020. The NERC model is a Transformer-based architecture and the EL model is a BiLSTM-based architecture. For NERC, our main contribution is two-fold: (1) data-wise improvement -we propose a knowledge-based strategy to provide related context information to the NERC model; (2) model-wise improvement -we adapt the NERC model to the task of detecting coarse-and fine-grained entities in non-standard text via adapters and we include the knowledge-based contexts as context jokers. Our approaches ranked first on 84.6% of the leaderboards we participated in for NERC and 85.7% of them for EL.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The identification of entities in historical documents, such as people and places, can be seen as a building block of historical knowledge that allows easier access and better information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,130.72,490.37,11.49,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,145.49,490.37,7.52,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,156.29,490.37,7.52,10.91" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,167.10,490.37,7.65,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Also, knowledge about historical events is gradually fading, especially among the younger generations. Thus, preserving the historical memory of the information that can be extracted from historical documents and bringing them to a larger audience, not limited to researchers and experts in the humanities <ref type="bibr" coords="1,329.84,531.01,11.48,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,344.28,531.01,7.52,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,354.76,531.01,7.65,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>, could lead to better and wider access to cultural heritage.</p><p>Although named entity recognition (NER) and linking (EL) systems have been developed to process modern data collections in general, NER and EL systems for processing historical documents are less common <ref type="bibr" coords="2,220.20,86.97,11.49,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.44,86.97,7.65,10.91" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Because these documents are not digitally born, they are scanned and processed by optical character recognition (OCR) tools to extract their textual content. However, the OCR process is not error free and misrecognizes some of the content. This can be due to the level of degradation of the document being scanned, the digitization process, and also the quality of the OCR tool. This causes digitization errors in the recognized text, such as misspelled locations or names.</p><p>In this context, the first CLEF-HIPE-2020 edition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.74,168.26,16.55,10.91" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.14,168.26,12.59,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.59,168.26,14.11,10.91" target="#b11">12]</ref> proposed the tasks of named entity recognition and classification (NERC), both fine-and coarse-grained, and entity linking (EL) in historical newspapers written in English, French and German.

In this paper, we present our participation in the Identifying Historical People, Places, and other Entities (HIPE) evaluation campaign of CLEF 2022 in both tasks: NERC, fine-grained and coarse-grained, and EL in historical newspapers. For both tasks, we based our models on those that we proposed at CLEF-HIPE-2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.58,317.30,16.41,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The NERC model was mainly based on the Transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="2,203.25,330.85,17.86,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the EL model was based on a BiLSTM architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.03,330.85,16.19,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. For NERC, our main contribution is two-fold: <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.05,344.40,11.81,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref> we propose a knowledge-based system, where we build a multilingual knowledge base resting on Wikipedia and Wikidata to provide related context information to the NERC model (data-wise improvement); <ref type="bibr" coords="2,399.41,371.50,11.81,10.91" target="#b1">(2)</ref> we adapt the NERC model to the task of detecting coarse-and fine-grained entities in non-standard text by learning modular language-and task-specific representations via newly-proposed additional adapters <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,412.15,16.56,10.91" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.81,412.15,12.42,10.91" target="#b23">24]</ref>, small bottleneck layers inserted between the weights of two auxiliary Transformer layers (model-wise improvement) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,245.48,425.70,16.41,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Furthermore, for taking advantage of the additional Wikipedia-based contexts, we include them in the model with mean-pooled representations that we refer to as context jokers. Official results of our participation show the effectiveness of our models over the CLEF-HIPE-2022 benchmark.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the task and the datasets. Section 3 presents our knowledge-retrieval modules. Sections 4 and 5 respectively present our NERC and EL systems and their corresponding performance. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6, where future work is also presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Datasets</head><p>The CLEF-HIPE-2022 competition proposed corpora composed of historical newspapers and classical commentaries covering circa 200 years. The historical newspaper data is composed of five datasets in English, Finnish, French, German and Swedish which originate from various projects and national libraries in Europe, from which, we experimented with the hipe-2020 dataset. hipe-2020 includes newspaper articles from Swiss, Luxembourgish and American  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,333.92,16.43,10.91" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,108.45,333.92,12.55,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,123.72,333.92,12.32,10.91" target="#b11">12]</ref>. We also experimented with the classical commentaries data from the Ajax Multi-Commentary (ajmc) project that is composed of digitized 19C commentaries published in French, German, and English <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.89,374.56,16.12,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, annotated with both universal named entities (person, location, organisation) and domain-specific named entities (bibliographic references to primary and secondary literature).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,126.02,401.66,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the statistics regarding the number and type of entities in the aforementioned datasets divided according to the training, development, and test sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Knowledge-based Contexts</head><p>One of the main challenges of NER applied to historical newspapers and classical commentaries concerns the digitization process of these heritage materials. The OCR output contains errors which produce noisy text and complications, similar to those studied in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,425.94,500.93,16.41,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Introducing external grammatically correct contexts into NERC systems have been shown to have a positive impact over the entities identification <ref type="bibr" coords="3,261.83,528.03,16.39,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. It consists on adding complementary and related sentences, paragraphs or documents from external resources like Wikipedia or knowledge graphs (KG) to enrich the surrounding of an entity, which helps NERC systems on detecting the correct label. KGs structure information in a connected form, by representing entities (e.g., people, places) as nodes, and relationships between entities (e.g., being part of, being located in) as edges. Thus, we propose two main techniques for generating additional contexts:</p><p>• Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module: We create a local instance of ElasticSearch<ref type="foot" coords="4,470.12,85.21,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , which provides dense vector field indexing and a 𝑘-nearest neighbor (kNN) search API. Given a query vector, this API obtains the 𝑘 closest vectors and returns those documents as search hits. • Knowledge Graph Embedding Retrieval Module: We produce English contexts by extending the indexing scheme to a knowledge graph embedding model over the Wikidata5m<ref type="foot" coords="4,481.26,154.31,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,488.20,156.07,17.79,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module</head><p>We download the latest (02/04/2022) XML dumps <ref type="foot" coords="4,311.22,217.59,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> of the French and German Wikipedia and transform them into plain text using the Wikipedia2Vec [30] utility <ref type="foot" coords="4,401.36,231.14,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . We focus on French and German since for English we create another type of retrieval module which also contains Wikipedia paragraphs. Similar to Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,293.95,259.99,16.27,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we define a document, inside our instance of ElasticSearch, as a triplet composed of a sentence, a title, and a paragraph. We create a dense vector index over the sentence embedding field computed with a pre-trained multilingual Sentence-BERT model<ref type="foot" coords="4,186.28,298.88,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,192.98,300.64,16.30,10.91" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,211.78,300.64,12.23,10.91" target="#b31">32]</ref>. During context retrieval, for a given sentence from the datasets described in Section 2, we compute its dense vector representation with the same multilingual Sentence-BERT pre-trained model and take it as a query to retrieve the top-k semantically similar documents based on a k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) cosine similarity search over the sentence embedding field (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,278.64,354.84,3.57,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Knowledge Graph Embedding Retrieval Module</head><p>Wikidata5m is a large-scale KG with aligned entity descriptions. It integrates around five million Wikidata<ref type="foot" coords="5,129.66,119.33,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref> entities, which are described in the first paragraph of the corresponding Wikipedia pages. We index the Wikidata5m dataset along with the dense vectors produced by the RotatE KG embedding model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,191.61,148.18,18.06,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> pre-trained over the same dataset <ref type="foot" coords="5,366.54,146.43,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_7">8</ref> . RotatE defines each relation between entities as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the dense vector space. In this case, we describe "an ElasticSearch document" as a triplet formed by an entity identifier, an entity description, and an entity embedding. We create a standard index on the entity identifier field and two dense vector indexes: the former on the entity embedding field, and the latter on the embeddings from the entity description field obtained with the same Sentence-BERT model as in the previous module. We propose two different methods for context retrieval (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,163.73,243.03,4.16,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) to evaluate the influence of the KG embedding on the semantic similarity:</p><p>• KG Embedding Retrieval Module 1: it takes into consideration the entity embedding index and follows the same principle utilized in the Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module. For a given sentence, the top-k semantically similar documents are retrieved over the sentence embedding field. • KG Embedding Retrieval Module 2: it retrieves the top-1 semantically similar document.</p><p>Then, a second search over the entity dense vector index is performed to retrieve the top-k similar documents based on the KG embeddings of the entities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Named Entity Recognition and Classification</head><p>In CLEF-HIPE-2022 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,178.77,626.60,16.23,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the named entity recognition and classification (NERC) task consists in the recognition and classification of entities, such as people and locations, within historical multilingual newspapers and classical commentaries. According to the organizers <ref type="bibr" coords="6,465.49,86.97,16.42,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, it is composed of two sub-tasks with different levels of difficulty:</p><p>• Subtask 1.1 -NERC-Coarse: the identification and categorization of entity mentions according to high-level entity types (e.g., Person, Location). • Subtask 1.2 -NERC-Fine: the recognition and classification of entity mentions at different levels, finer-grained entity types and nested entities, up to one level of depth (nested entities). Our proposed architecture is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,325.05,464.90,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. In the right, we detail our model that consists in a Base Model with new adapter layers, and the encoding of the additional contexts (context jokers). As an overview, after the contexts are generated for an initial sentence, we encode the tokens of the sentence with the Base Model, while the additional contexts are only passed through the BERT pre-trained model encoder. These representations are afterward concatenated, followed by the prediction CRF-based layers. In the left, we present two example sentences from hipe-2020 and ajmc, for demonstrating the different levels of the entity types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">NERC Architecture</head><p>Base Model Our base model is based on the architecture proposed for CLEF-HIPE-2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,89.29,588.29,16.42,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,108.43,588.29,14.02,10.91" target="#b24">25]</ref> that consists in a hierarchical, multitask learning approach, with a fine-tuned encoder based on BERT. The previous model included an encoder with two Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="6,457.70,601.84,18.06,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> layers on top of the BERT pre-trained model encoder. This year, we add adapter modules to these layers <ref type="bibr" coords="6,119.18,628.93,16.41,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The adapters are added to each Transformer layer after the projection following multi-headed attention. The adapter consists of a bottleneck which contains few parameters relative to the attention and feed-forward layers in the original model. This acts as a task adapter <ref type="bibr" coords="6,125.52,669.58,17.90,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> for fine-grained NER. The attention modules in the Transformer layers adapt not only to the task, but also to the noisy input which proved to increase performance of NER in such special conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="7,197.53,100.52,16.42,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Finally, the multitask prediction layer consists of separate CRF layers 9 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context Jokers</head><p>In order to include the additional contexts generated as explained in Section 3, we introduce the context jokers. Each additional context is passed through the BERT pre-trained model encoder 10 which is afterward mean-pooled along the sequence axis 11 . We call this representation the context joker. The context jokers are afterward concatenated with the sequential representation of the initial tokens of the sentence, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,459.77,201.02,5.05,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and they are discarded at the moment of prediction. We call them jokers because we see them as wild cards unobtrusively inserted in the representation of the current sentence for improving the recognition of the fine-grained entities. However, we also consider that these jokers can affect the results in a way not immediately apparent and could also be harmful to the performance of a NERC system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Experiments and Internal Results</head><p>CLEF-HIPE-2022 consists in assessing both tasks, NERC and EL in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F1) at macro and micro levels <ref type="bibr" coords="7,343.71,331.90,16.56,10.91" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,363.00,331.90,14.11,10.91" target="#b9">10]</ref>  12 . Two evaluation scenarios are considered: strict (exact boundary matching) and fuzzy boundary matching. For our internal NERC results, we report only the strict matching (NERC-Coarse and NERC-Fine). Our experimental setup consists in a baseline model and three settings with different levels of knowledge-based contexts:</p><p>• no-context: Base Model with bert-base-multilingual-cased 13 ; • v0-language-specific: context jokers are generated with Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module; • v1-en-wk5m: context jokers are generated with KG Embedding Retrieval Module 1; • v2-en-wk5m: contexts jokers are generated with KG Embedding Retrieval Module 2.</p><p>French Our preliminary results for French, hipe-2020 and ajmc datasets, are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,115.30,521.35,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. They reveal that generating contexts with KG Embedding Retrieval Module 1 &amp; 2 brings considerable improvements for HIPE even if our Base Model provides the higher precision for NERC-Coarse and the Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module the higher recall for both granularities. Adding any type of context to ajmc seems to slightly affect the precision while German As for German, our preliminary results presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,391.52,649.60,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> show the larger improvements when applying contexts for both ajmc and hipe-2020, specially with KG Embedding Retrieval Module 1 &amp; 2. We assume that this is due the considerably smaller training dataset than for the other languages.</p><p>English Our preliminary results for English, shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,383.71,346.92,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, indicate that generating contexts with KG Embedding Retrieval Module 1 &amp; 2 brings considerable improvements on ajmc for both granularities. Adding contexts to hipe-2020 has a double effect. They negatively impact precision while improving recall. This is due to the lack of English training documents and the fact that the contexts were generated using the French and German hipe-2020 training datasets 14 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">CLEF-HIPE-2022 Results</head><p>The official CLEF-HIPE-2022 competition was restricted to two submissions. We, thus, selected our baseline (no-context) and our best context generator models (v2-en-wk5m). In order to improve the performance of our models, we stacked, for each language, a language-specific language model. For English, we add bert-base-cased 15 , while for French and German, we add the open-source French and German Europeana BERT models pretrained on the open source Europeana digitized newspapers provided by The European Library and published by the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) 16 .</p><p>French, German, English Our official results for French, German and English are shown in Tables <ref type="table" coords="9,118.71,588.00,7.32,10.91" target="#tab_4">5,</ref><ref type="table" coords="9,128.15,588.00,3.66,10.91">6</ref>, and 7 respectively.

Since the English hipe-2020 has only NERC-Coarse entities, we discarded the NERC-Fine and the nested entities from the the French and German hipe-2020, before training. 15 We utilized the English BERT model https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased. 16 We utilized the bert-base-french-europeana-cased and bert-base-german-europeana-cased from https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/. a general improvement for all languages for ajmc. The additional contexts for hipe-2020 behave differently. For French, our baseline model performed better for coarse granularity with exact boundary matching. For German, contexts improved performance for coarse granularity while slightly negatively affecting fine granularity. Finally, for English, the KG Embedding Retrieval Module 2 boosted the performance for the coarse-grained entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Entity Linking</head><p>In CLEF-HIPE-2022, the EL task consists in the disambiguation of named entities using two settings:</p><p>• EL-only: The ground-truth regarding the entity mentions is provided, hence the entity disambiguation runs uses the gold entity mentions of NERC and the only variable is the EL system; • End-to-end EL: No prior knowledge of the named entities is given, therefore EL has to be performed over the named entities predicted with the NERC models (no-context and v2-en-wk5m). Our EL model is based on the same neural approach that we proposed for CLEF-HIPE-2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="11,487.55,454.79,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. It is combined with a filtering process to analyze the historical mentions and to disambiguate them using the Wikidata KB <ref type="bibr" coords="11,224.77,481.89,16.41,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Combining information from Wikipedia, Wikidata, and DBpedia allows a thorough analysis of the characteristics of the entities and, as in CLEF-HIPE-2020, it helped our method to correctly disambiguate mentions in historical documents. Table <ref type="table" coords="11,501.01,508.99,4.98,10.91" target="#tab_6">8</ref> presents our EL scores for CLEF-HIPE-2022 in terms of P, R, and F1 for the hipe-2020 dataset. It can be observed that adding contexts to German and English has a negative impact on the recall which is consistent with our NERC results (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="11,356.87,549.64,5.17,10.91">6</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="11,384.39,549.64,31.03,10.91">Table 7</ref>). Results also show that applying additional contexts to French does not increase performances.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>For the participation of our team (L3i) in CLEF-HIPE-2022, we proposed two neural-based methods for the tasks of NERC and EL. We conclude, for NERC, that our joker-based approach generally performed well, due to the additional KG-based contexts and model improvements in regards to the treatment of such contexts. For EL, the model we proposed for CLEF-HIPE-2020 confirmed its good performance, with and without context. Finally, we consider that external knowledge has brought clear improvements to both our approaches and future work on this subject could furthermore prove the utility and importance of high-quality symbolic knowledge.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,528.65,309.22,8.93;4,193.47,377.55,208.35,138.53"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Context retrieval for the Wikipedia Knowledge Retrieval Module.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,193.47,377.55,208.35,138.53" type="bitmap" /></figure>
