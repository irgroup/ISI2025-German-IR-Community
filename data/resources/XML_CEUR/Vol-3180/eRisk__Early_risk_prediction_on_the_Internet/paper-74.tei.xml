<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Measuring the severity of the signs of eating disorders is a new task introduced in the eRisk 2022 competition. The goal of this task is to infer the severity of the signs of Eating Disorders (ED) in social media users given their writings on said platform. These signs are inventoried by a standard self-report questionnaire. We presented two unsupervised similarity-based models using per-question feature sets that were developed using expert knowledge of discussions of ED online. These features are supported by dense word representations, namely GloVe and word2vec. The obtained results were modest as no training data were available.</p></div>

This task follows in the spirit of eRisk 2018 Task 2, which was aimed at the early detection of signs of Anorexia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,454.35,546.86,16.25,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>This paper presents the similarity-based approaches proposed by the RELAI team to Task 3 of eRisk 2022. The proposed approaches rely on feature sets dedicated to each item in the questionnaire. The features sets developed with expert knowledge are compared to the written production of users based on pre-trained word vectors. The developed models try to measure the severity of the signs of ED in an unsupervised manner. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the relevant literature. Section 3 introduces the dataset and task in detail, while Section 4 presents the proposed approach. Finally, Sections 5 and 6 report on the experiments and conclude the paper.</p></div>

Astorino et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.27,253.99,12.84,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> used a SVM classifier to analyze the relationship between nutrition, health status and well-being of individuals with the principal objective of identifying possible psychological elements associated with ED. They studied the situation of young people at an Italian high school regarding ED by carrying out a statistical survey on the students in relation to dietary habits, attitudes towards food and physical activity. Finally, the reported results suggest that machine learning algorithms can detect signs of ED based on socio-demographic and psychological characteristics. In a study by Haynos et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.95,335.28,11.42,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, females with heterogeneous ED diagnoses completed demographic and psychiatric assessments at baseline, Year 1 and 2 follow-ups. Elastic net and logistic regression models were able to predict ED diagnosis, binge eating, compensatory behavior, and underweight Body Mass Index (BMI) at Years 1 and 2.</p><p>Separately, models based on similarity measures have been implemented for the detection of mental health disorders in social media. Maupomé et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,368.56,416.58,12.84,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> presented similarity based models for early detection of signs of pathological gambling. In their approaches, they inferred whether a test user was at risk based on the similarity between the topics present in the textual productions of users were similar to those present in problem-gambling testimonials. In other work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.90,470.77,11.46,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, comparing textual similarities was used to predict Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) answers for the users of social media. Hypothesizing that a person can produce contents similar to BDI answers, the cosine similarity between the encoded textual productions of the users and BDI answers was computed. In a similar work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,300.90,511.42,16.41,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, cosine similarity was used to filter posts relevant to each BDI question. Through the use of pre-trained sentence transformer models, the proximity between user posts to each BDI answer was measured.</p><p>The present work sought then to apply the potential of similarity-based approaches to the assessment of ED signs from the writings posted on social media platforms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task and data</head><p>The eRisk 2022 Task 3 dataset has only a testing set containing 28 subjects. For each subject, there is a history of postings on the Reddit 2 social media platform and a questionnaire filled by that subject. The questionnaire is extracted from the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) <ref type="foot" coords="3,127.26,98.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> , which is a self-reported questionnaire with 28 items and adapted from the semistructured interview Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,339.98,114.06,16.09,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This questionnaire was designed to assess the range and severity of features associated with a diagnosis of eating disorder using four subscales (Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern) and a global score. However, only questions 1-12 and 19-28 were considered in this competition. The statistics of the eRisk 2022 Task 3 dataset are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,361.93,168.26,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. MZOE corresponds to the proportion of incorrect predictions from the system. MAE and MAE macro measure the average (resp. macro-averaged) deviation of the predicted response from the true response. Therefore, a perfect predictor would get scores of 0 for each of the metrics above. In the equations below, 𝑓 denotes the classification done by an automatic system, 𝑄 is the set of questions of each questionnaire, 𝑞 𝑖 is the 𝑖-th question, 𝑅(𝑞 𝑖 ) is the user's answer for the 𝑖-th question and 𝑓 (𝑞 𝑖 ) is the predicted answer of the system for the 𝑖-th question. 𝑄 𝑗 also represents the set of questions whose true answer is 𝑗 ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 6}.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Word representations</head><p>Two kinds of pre-trained word vectors were used as word representation. The first are 300dimensional word2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="4,195.11,487.21,18.07,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> word vectors trained on publicly available textual content such as Wikipedia and UMBC WebBase corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="4,280.52,500.76,18.05,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> using the Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,120.35,514.31,16.41,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The second were GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="4,255.31,514.31,18.07,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> word vectors trained on two billion Twitter<ref type="foot" coords="4,475.09,512.55,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> posts (tweets). Unlike word2vec, GloVe does not rely only on local context words, but incorporates global word co-occurrence <ref type="bibr" coords="4,211.39,541.41,16.32,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Three different sizes of GloVe word vectors were used in our models: 50, 100 and 200.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Feature sets</head><p>A set of features per question in the EDE-Q was developed using expert knowledge, totaling 22 feature sets. An expert identified words that would allow to answer a given question in the EDE-Q questionnaire. For example, for the question In the last 28 days, have you felt fat? (Q11), words such as fat and scale were considered as features. As a result, a set of around 30 features per question was prepared (for details, see Table <ref type="table" coords="5,302.44,86.97,4.97,10.91">6</ref> in Appendix A). After developing the feature sets, each feature was associated with the relevant pre-trained word vector, resulting in a set of word vectors per question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Models</head><p>In accordance with the use of the EDE-Q (see Section 3), the models examined only the writings posted in the last 28 days by a given user. These writings are combined into a single text document. Then, for a given question in the questionnaire, only the set of words in the history present in the associated feature set were kept; all other words were removed. As with the feature sets, these words were replaced by the relevant word vectors, resulting in 22 sets of vectors per user, each pertaining to a different question in the questionnaire.</p><p>Model-A In Model-A (named RELAI_A in the eRisk 2022 report), the word vectors in each feature set were aggregated together by averaging, yielding one vector per question. The same was done to the sets of word vectors selected for each users, obtaining 28 vectors each representing a user. Next, for each user, the cosine similarity between the vector representing that user and the ones developed for 22 questions was computed, obtaining 22 similarity values per user.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,234.29,339.42,126.69,27.45">CosSim(𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑢 𝑖 ) = 𝑞 ⊤ 𝑖 𝑢 𝑖 ‖𝑞 𝑖 ‖‖𝑢 𝑖 ‖ ,</formula><p>where 𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑢 𝑖 refer to the feature (resp. user) vectors corresponding to the 𝑖-th question of the questionnaire.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Evaluation on proxy data</head><p>Since eRisk 2022 Task 3 dataset only has testing data, we used the eRisk 2018 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="6,472.39,107.54,17.99,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for early detection of signs of anorexia to evaluate the performance of our models. This dataset contains a collection of Reddit posts from people who may or may not suffer from an eating disorder. The original dataset contains a set of Reddit posts per subject (sometimes spanning multiple years). For the purposes of the EDE-Q, a dedicated dataset was created from the aforementioned dataset. Each subject's history of writings was then sliced into periods of 28 days and treated as a separate observation. This sought to reduce the bias for annotators: having only a period of 28 days to go on, we ensured the the EDE-Q questionnaire was filled with only data from the period of 28 days imposed by the questionnaire.</p><p>Filling the questionnaires. The process described above resulted in a set of 362 observations. They were distributed to two annotators with different levels of expertise according to the presence of the curated features mentioned previously. Each post was analyzed individually, computing the number of features present. Posts were marked as potentially containing EDrelated discourse if: (1) if different feature words comprised at least 25% of the post length (in words) or, (2) over 10 feature words were present. The latter condition was added to contend with short posts.</p><p>Observations where at least one post fulfills at least one of these conditions were assigned to a psychology student with deep knowledge on online discussions about ED. The remaining documents -the ones deemed unlikely to contain any mention of ED -were assigned to an annotator with no expert knowledge on ED. The annotators were instructed to solely rely on the information contained in the document to estimate the answer that the given subject would have recorded on the questionnaire. For example, in a document where a subject detailed their diet and calorie intake over the course of the month, the annotator could make an informed assessment for the aspect of ED addressed in question 1: Have they been deliberately trying to limit the amount of food they eat to influence their shape or weight (whether or not they have succeeded)? Models and evaluation results on proxy data. Based on the type and size of the word vectors used, we obtained eight models as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,348.71,503.78,3.73,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. In the first experiments on proxy data, the feature sets with all the features were used in the models. Obtained results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,128.63,530.88,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. However, assuming that more precise feature sets with smaller intersection with each other can improve the results, the feature sets sizes were reduced to 10 words on average. This process was done in two steps: (1) removal of adverbs of frequency (e.g. always, often, sometimes), (2) keeping the words that were closely associated to a given question. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.71,585.08,3.74,10.91">4</ref>, reducing the number of features improved the results.</p><p>Three observations can be made from the results obtained on the proxy dataset: (1) word vectors with higher dimensions improved the results, (2) for each model configuration, Model-B slightly outperformed Model-A, (3) the models with more specific features had better results. Accordingly, the following models were selected for the competition: Model-A-W2V, Model-B-W2V, Model-B-W2V-AllFeatures, Model-B-GloVe200, Model-B-GloVe200-AllFeatures. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental results</head><p>As the results presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,241.48,610.83,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_5">5</ref> show, the best performances were achieved by Model-B-W2V-AllFeatures and Model-B-GloVe200-AllFeatures. Hence, the performances recorded at the test phase are significantly worse than those on the proxy data. Furthermore, unlike the results obtained on the proxy dataset, the best performing models at the eRisk competition used the less specific feature sets. The limited generalization capabilities of the proposed models suggest that some level of overfitting occurred. In addition, among the four subscales, the recorded results on the Eating Concern Subscale (ECS) are consistently better than that of the other subscales, which suggests that our features better captured some discourse elements of eating concerns. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>For measuring the severity of the signs of Eating Disorders, we presented five models that used two main algorithms based on similarity measurement. In addition, we developed a feature set for each of the 22 questions (topics) of the questionnaire. The results achieved were moderate since it was a new challenge without training data. Future work will aim to use word vectors trained on data more germane to the setting to represent user posts and the feature sets. This can be used in combination with unsupervised machine learning algorithms.</p><p>Reproducibility.
