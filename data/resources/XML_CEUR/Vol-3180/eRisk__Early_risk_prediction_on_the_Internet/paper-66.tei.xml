<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The major purpose of eRisk is to conduct research on evaluation methodologies, metrics, and other elements related to building research collections and identifying difficulties for early risk identification. Early detection technology can be useful in a variety of sectors, notably those involving safety and health. An automated system may issue early warnings when a person begins to exhibit indications of a mental illness, a sexual abuser begins engaging with a child, or a suspected criminal begins making antisocial threats on the Internet. While our evaluation approaches (new research collections development strategies, creative evaluation measures, etc.) can be applied across different domains, eRisk has thus far concentrated on psychological difficulties (depression, self-harm, pathological gambling, and eating disorders).</p><p>In 2017, we conducted an exploratory task on the early detection of depression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,457.07,86.97,11.49,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,471.89,86.97,7.65,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The evaluation methods and test dataset described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,309.97,100.52,12.90,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> were the focus of this pilot task. In 2018, we continued detecting early signs of depression while also launching a new challenge of detecting early signs of anorexia <ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.75,127.61,11.48,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.02,127.61,7.65,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>. In 2019, we ran the continuation of the challenge on early identification of symptoms of anorexia, a challenge on early detection of signs of self-harm, and a third task aimed at estimating a user's responses to a depression questionnaire focused on her social media interactions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.12,168.26,11.48,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.73,168.26,7.52,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.39,168.26,7.65,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In 2020, we continued with the early detection of self-harm, and the task on severity estimation of depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.08,181.81,11.47,10.91" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,426.29,181.81,12.59,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.61,181.81,12.41,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Finally, in the last edition in 2021, we presented two tasks on early detection (pathological gambling and self-harm) and one on the severity estimation of depression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.97,208.91,16.43,10.91" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,376.12,208.91,12.55,10.91" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,391.40,208.91,12.32,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref>. We've had the opportunity to compare a wide selection of solutions that use various technologies and concepts over the years (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, or Information Retrieval). We discovered that the link between psychological disorders and language use is complex, and that some contributing systems are not very effective. For example, the majority of participants had performance levels (e.g., F1) that were less than 70%. These figures indicate that further research into early prediction tasks is needed, and the solutions presented thus far have a lot of space for improvement. In 2022, the lab had three campaign-style tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,308.88,317.30,16.41,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The first task is the second edition of the pathological gambling domain. This task follows the same organisation as previous early detection challenges. The second task is also a continuation of the early detection of the depression challenge, whose last edition was in 2018. Finally, we provided a new task for the eating disorder severity estimation. Participants were required to analyse the user's posts and then estimate the user's answers to a standard eating disorder questionnaire. We describe these tasks in greater detail in the following sections of this overview article. We had 93 teams registered for the lab. We finally received results from 17 of them: 41 runs for Task 1, 62 runs for Task 2 and 12 for Task 3. The lab had three campaign-style projects in 2022 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,317.94,439.25,18.72,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.The first task is the second edition of the early alert problem on the pathological gambling domain. This challenge follows the same organisation as prior early detection challenges. The second one is likewise a continuation of the early identification of depression challenge, which had its most recent edition in 2018. Finally, we present a novel task for the eating disorder severity estimation. Participants have to analyze the user's posts and then estimate the user's responses to a typical eating disorder questionnaire. These tasks are described in greater detail in the next sections of this overview article. The lab had 93 teams registered. We eventually got responses from 17 of them: 41 runs for Task 1, 62 runs for Task 2, and 12 for Task 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task 1: Early Detection of Signs of Pathological Gambling</head><p>This is a follow-up to Task 1 from 2021. The task was to create new models for detecting pathological gambling risk early on. Pathological gambling is also known as ludomania (ICD-10-CM code F63.0). It is usually referred as gambling addiction (an urge to gamble independently of its negative consequences). According to the World Health Organization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.72,646.91,16.28,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, adult gambling addiction has prevalence rates ranging from 0.1 percent to 6.0 percent in 2017. As quickly as feasible, the task required progressively digesting evidence and detecting early indicators of pathological gambling, also known as compulsive gambling or disordered gambling. Participating systems have to read and analyse Social Media posts in the order that users wrote them. As a result, systems that perform well in this task may be used to monitor user activities in blogs, social networks, and other types of online media in a sequential manner. This task's test collection followed the same format as the collection specified in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.70,291.67,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It is a collection of writings (posts or comments) from a set of Social Media users. The data source is also the same as in earlier eRisks (Reddit). There are two types of users: pathological gamblers and non-pathological gamblers, and the collection includes a series of posts for each (in chronological order). We put up a server that distributed user writings among the participating teams incrementally. The lab website<ref type="foot" coords="3,309.34,357.67,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> contains more information about the server. This was a training and test task. The teams got access to training data for the training stage, where we published the entire history of writings for training users. We identified which users had specifically said that they are pathological gamblers. As a result, the participants could tweak their systems using the training data. The training data for Task 1 in 2022 was made up of all Task 1 users from 2021. Participants connected to our server and iteratively received user writings and sent responses during the test stage. At any time in the user chronology, any participant could pause and deliver an alert. After reading each user post, the teams had to decide whether to alert about the user (the system predicts the person would develop the risk) or not. Participants had to make this decision independently for each user in the test split. We regarded alerts as final (i.e. further decisions about this individual were ignored). In contrast, no alerts were regarded as provisional (i.e. the participants could later submit an alert about this user if they detected the appearance of signs of risk). To evaluate the systems, we used the correctness of the decisions and the number of user writes required to produce the decisions (see below). We set up a REST service to help with testing. While waiting for responses, the server progressively disseminated user writings to each participant (no new user data was distributed to a specific participant until the service received all decisions for users and runs from that team in previous step). From January 17th, 2022 through April 22nd, 2022, the service was open for submissions. We used current methodologies that optimise the utilisation of assessors' time to produce the ground truth assessments <ref type="bibr" coords="3,298.63,630.40,16.51,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,317.86,630.40,12.38,10.91" target="#b17">18]</ref>. These methods enable the creation of test collections through the use of simulated pooling algorithms. The key statistics of the test collection utilised for T1 are reported in table 1 . The following sections go over evaluation methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Decision-based Evaluation</head><p>This form of evaluation revolves around the (binary) decisions taken for each user by the participating systems. Besides standard classification measures (Precision, Recall and F1<ref type="foot" coords="4,497.22,161.90,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> ), we computed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, the early risk detection error used in previous editions of the lab. A full description of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,285.26,190.75,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Essentially, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is an error measure that introduces a penalty for late correct alerts (true positives). The penalty grows with the delay in emitting the alert, and the delay is measured here as the number of user posts that had to be processed before making the alert. Since 2019, we complemented the evaluation report with additional decision-based metrics that try to capture additional aspects of the problem. These metrics try to overcome some limitations of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, namely:</p><p>• the penalty associated to true positives goes quickly to 1. This is due to the functional form of the cost function (sigmoid). • a perfect system, which detects the true positive case right after the first round of messages (first chunk), does not get error equal to 0. • with a method based on releasing data in a chunk-based way (as it was done in 2017 and 2018) the contribution of each user to the performance evaluation has a large variance (different for users with few writings per chunk vs users with many writings per chunk). • 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is not interpretable. Some research teams have analysed these issues and proposed alternative ways for evaluation. Trotzek and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="4,191.55,432.88,17.76,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> proposed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . This is a variant of ERDE that does not depend on the number of user writings seen before the alert but, instead, it depends on the percentage of user writings seen before the alert. In this way, user's contributions to the evaluation are normalized (currently, all users weight the same). However, there is an important limitation of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . In real life applications, the overall number of user writings is not known in advance. Social Media users post contents online and screening tools have to make predictions with the evidence seen. In practice, you do not know when (and if) a user's thread of messages is exhausted. Thus, the performance metric should not depend on knowledge about the total number of user writings. Another proposal of an alternative evaluation metric for early risk prediction was done by Sadeque and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="4,195.19,568.37,16.10,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. They proposed 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 , which fits better with our purposes. This measure is described next. Imagine a user 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 and an early risk detection system that iteratively analyzes 𝑢's writings (e.g. in chronological order, as they appear in Social Media) and, after analyzing 𝑘 𝑢 user writings (𝑘 𝑢 ≥ 1), takes a binary decision 𝑑 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, which represents the decision of the system about the user being a risk case. By 𝑔 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, we refer to the user's golden truth label. A key component of an early risk evaluation should be the delay on detecting true positives (we do not want systems to detect these cases too late). Therefore, a first and intuitive measure of delay can be defined as follows <ref type="foot" coords="5,227.34,98.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,184.61,138.57,322.03,12.74">latency 𝑇 𝑃 = median{𝑘 𝑢 : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This measure of latency is calculated over the true positives detected by the system and assesses the system's delay based on the median number of writings that the system had to process to detect such positive cases. This measure can be included in the experimental report together with standard measures such as Precision (P), Recall (R) and the F-measure (F):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,228.19,238.15,278.45,25.50">𝑃 = |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1| |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 1|<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,228.34,267.90,278.30,25.50">𝑅 = |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1| |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑔 𝑢 = 1|<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,228.17,296.93,278.46,24.43">𝐹 = 2 • 𝑃 • 𝑅 𝑃 + 𝑅<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, Sadeque et al. proposed a measure, 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 , which combines the effectiveness of the decision (estimated with the F measure) and the delay 4 in the decision. This is calculated by multiplying F by a penalty factor based on the median delay. More specifically, each individual (true positive) decision, taken after reading 𝑘 𝑢 writings, is assigned the following penalty:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,202.86,405.50,303.77,24.89">𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) = -1 + 2 1 + exp -𝑝•(𝑘𝑢-1)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 is a parameter that determines how quickly the penalty should increase. In <ref type="bibr" coords="5,457.82,441.82,16.11,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, 𝑝 was set such that the penalty equals 0.5 at the median number of posts of a user 5 . Observe that a decision right after the first writing has no penalty (i.e. 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(1) = 0).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Ranking-based Evaluation</head><p>This section explains a different type of evaluation that was employed in addition to the examination stated above. Following each data release (new user writing), participants were required to provide back the following information (for each user in the collection): i) a user decision (alert/no alert), which was utilised to compute the decision-based metrics outlined above, and ii) a score representing the user's level of risk (estimated from the evidence seen so far). We used these results to create a user ranking based on decreasing assessed risk. We have one ranking at each point for each participating system (i.e., ranking after one writing, ranking after two writings, etc.). This replicates a constant re-ranking strategy based on previous evidence. In practise, this ranking would be offered to an expert user who would make decisions (e.g. by inspecting the rankings). Each ranking can be evaluated with standard IR metrics, such as P@10 or NDCG. We, therefore, report the ranking-based performance of the systems after seeing 𝑘 writings (with varying 𝑘).</p></div>

This time-lapse is indicative of the degree of automation of each team's algorithms. A few of the submitted runs processed the entire thread of messages ( <ref type="formula" coords="7,148.96,297.25,16.56,10.91">2001</ref>), but many variants stopped earlier. Some of the teams were still submitting results at the deadline time. Three teams processed the thread of messages reasonably fast (around a day for processing the entire history of user messages). The rest of the teams took several days to run the whole process. Some teams took even more than a week. This extension suggests that they incorporated some form of offline processing. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,115.16,365.00,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref> reports the decision-based performance achieved by the participating teams. In terms of Precision, the best performing team was the NLPGroup-IISERB (run 4) but at the expense of a very low recall. In terms of 𝐹 1, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 50 and latency-weighted 𝐹 1, the best performing run was submitted by the UNED NLD team. Their run (#4) also has a pretty high level of Recall (.938). Many teams achieved perfect Recall at the expense of very low Precision figures. In terms of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 , the best performing runs are SINAI #0 and #1 and BLUE #0. The majority of teams made quick decisions. Overall, these findings indicate that some systems achieved a relatively high level of effectiveness with only a few user submissions. Social and public health systems may use the best predictive algorithms to assist expert humans in detecting signs of pathological gambling as early as possible.. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,115.31,500.49,4.97,10.91">4</ref> presents the ranking-based results. Because some teams only processed a few dozens of user writings, we could only compute their user rankings for the initial number of processsed writings. For those participants providing ties in the scores for the users, we used the traditional docid criteria (subject name) for breaking the ties. Some runs (e.g., UNED-NLP #4, BLUE #0 and #1 and UNSL #0, #1 and #2) have very good levels of ranking-based shallow effectiveness over multiple points (after one writing, after 100 writings, and so forth). Regarding the 100 cut-off, the best performing teams after one writing for nDCG are UNED-NLP (#2) and BLUE (#0 and #1). In the other scenarios, both UNED-NLP and UNSL obtain very good results.</p></div>

In order to accomplish this, the participants worked from a thread of user posts.

We only used questions 1 through 12 and 19 through 28. This test is intended to measure the extent and severity of multiple eating disorder symptoms. It incorporates four subscales (Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern) as well as an overall score. Table <ref type="table" coords="14,237.01,281.08,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_12">9</ref> has a list of questions.       The goal of this task is to study the feasibility of automatically evaluating the severity of multiple eating disorder symptoms. Based on the user's writing history, the algorithms must estimate the user's response to each specific question. We collected surveys filled out by Social Media users as well as their writing history (we extracted each history of writings right after the user provided us with the filled questionnaire). The quality of the responses produced by the participating systems was evaluated using user-completed questionnaires (ground truth). This was a test task only. The participants received no training data. The participants were given a dataset with 28 individuals (each user's writing history was provided) and asked to create a file with the following structure: username1 answer1 answer2 ... answer22 username2 answer1 answer2 ... answer22</p><p>Each line has the username and 22 values.

This team participated in the two early detection challenges (T1 and T2) and employed a transformer-based architecture for user-level classification. More specifically, the interaction between users' posts was analysed, and some technological elements were oriented to mitigate noise in the dataset.

The team participated in task 1. The group explored the use of approximate nearest neighbours (ANN) over dense representations of the users' posts based on the Universal Sentence Encoder. Post-level labels were re-computed from the user-level annotations in the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BioNLP-UniBuc [30]</head><p>The team from the University of Bucharest participated in Task 1. After processing the provided XML files, the resulting training dataset had an unbalanced number of examples for each of the two classes, so they used a stratified 5-fold cross-validation to try to reduce the class imbalance in the train/validation splits. For feature extraction, the authors used the Bag-of-Words and tf-idf models with additional properties for extracting relevant features such as removing the rare words or frequent words, constructing 2-grams and 3-grams. The team performs three runs combining classification methods with deep learning models. When using deep learning models, the best outcome was obtained by a model containing a hidden dimension of 128 of the linear projection, an embedding size of 64 tokens, and four attention heads.</p></div>

This team participated in eRisk 2022 T1 task, on early identification of pathological gambling. All variants proposed are based on Glove features, extracted from user posts and the classification of user posts was done with SVMs or XGBoost.</p><p>CYUT <ref type="bibr" coords="25,123.74,440.17,20.05,9.77" target="#b31">[32]</ref> THE CYUT team belongs to the Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan. They participated in the early risk detection of depression task (task 2). Their runs exploit RoBERTa massive pre-trained model to address the problem with out-of-the-box and improved representations. In their best run (#2), they use the output vector of the last layer hidden for linear classification as post representation.</p><p>LauSAn <ref type="bibr" coords="25,131.95,507.92,20.05,9.77" target="#b32">[33]</ref> The University of Zurich took part only in the early detection of depression, and they focused expressively on the time-sensitivity of the task. Their approach is based on two simple strategies of optimising standard text classification models to the early detection of depression: concatenating the posts in different ways during and inference training (to optimise training), and continuously changing the decision threshold at inference time (to optimise the results of time-sensitive metrics). An ablation study confirmed that both strategies were effective. In fact, the team achieved among the best results in all time-sensitive evaluation metrics.</p><p>TUA1 <ref type="bibr" coords="25,120.93,616.31,20.05,9.77" target="#b33">[34]</ref> The University of Tokushima participated only in the detection of early risks of depression. They proposed a novel and very interesting approach called TAM: Time-Aware-Affective Memories. A TAM network maintains the memory of a user's "affective state" which gets updated as a new user's posting becomes available. All of this is fed to a Transformer decoder which then predicts the user's risk of depression. A study of the latency penalty complements the approach to see how this could be effectively used to reduce the ERDE metric score. Their results show that the approach is very efficient and particularly good for the very early-stage detection of depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNED-MED [35]</head><p>The team from the Spanish National University of Distance Education (UNED) propose two rather standard approaches. The first is based on the use of feature-driven classifiers employing features based on textual data, like terms tf-idf, first-person pronoun use, sentiment analysis and depression terminology. The second is on a Deep Learning classifier with pre-trained Embeddings. The main innovation is to enlarge the training data (to make it more balanced) with data extracted from the same source of eRisk data. Yet the results show only modest performance. An explanation suggested by the teams is that the depression detection task was more challenging this year. This might be possible, but it is something the organisers will need to crosscheck across all participants. Sunday-Rocker2 <ref type="bibr" coords="26,175.03,250.48,20.04,9.77" target="#b35">[36]</ref> The team from the University of Bucharest applied a variety of techniques for addressing the T2 challenge, from using tf-idf and linguistic features extracted from Reddit writings to using the MixUP technique (a new approach for sentence classification to augment the data through interpolation). The main interest is in the novelty of the approaches taken and the way that the features were selected, with some strongly linguistic-based features, such as self-preoccupation (based on the use of the occurrence of first-number pronouns) and similar features. The best results were obtained with a Voting Classifier with hard voting applied on textual features and with an SVM used on both textual features and numerical features as well. E8-IJS <ref type="bibr" coords="26,122.43,372.43,20.05,9.77" target="#b36">[37]</ref> This Slovenian team includes researchers from Jozef Stefan Institute (Ljubljana) and the Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences. Their participation in eRisk 2022 focused on the task of early identification of depression cases. To that end, these participants utilized a classical supervised learning approach (Logistic Regression), and the main goal of their experiments was to compare different input representations to the logistic classifier. This included experiments with i) tf-idf representations that were reduced to a latent space via Latent Semantic Analysis and ii) Sentence Bert representations of the input data. Their classification methods work at the post level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conlusions</head><p>The purpose of this paper was to present an overview of eRisk 2022. This lab's sixth version focused on two sorts of tasks. On the one hand, two tasks focused on early identification of pathological gambling and depression (Tasks 1 and 2, respectively), in which participants were given sequential access to the user's social media posts and were required to issue alerts regarding at-risk persons. On the other hand, one task (Task 3) was assigned to measuring the severity of the indicators of eating disorders, in which participants were provided the whole user history and their systems were required to automatically predict the user's replies to a standard depression questionnaire. The proposed tasks received 115 runs from 17 different teams. Although the efficacy of the proposed solutions is currently limited, the experimental results demonstrate that evidence retrieved from social media is valuable, and automatic or semiautomatic screening methods to discover at-risk persons might be developed. These findings push us to investigate the establishment of text-based risk indicator screening benchmarks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,89.29,216.34,324.08,9.43"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Latency penalty increases with the number of observed writings (𝑘 𝑢 )</figDesc></figure>

Regarding Task 1 and Task 2, the team performed five runs using different text mining frameworks in which AB, LR, RF and SVM classifiers were tested, as well as BERT, Bio-BERT, RoBERTa and Longformer models from the HuggingFace library. All of them with a variety of engineering features and techniques. The results achieved for Task 1 and Task 2 present successful numbers on precision, recall and F1. NLPGroup-IISERB run #4 achieves the best precision score (1.0) among the precision scores of all 41 submissions for task 1 of the eRisk2022 challenge. The team observed from the empirical analysis that the classical BOW model performs better than all the deep learning-based models on the given data except the longformer model. The Longformer model performed as good as the BOW model for Task1, but we could not explore its performance for task2 owing to time limitations. Regarding task 3, NLP-IISERB were one of the top results in the competition, presenting four runs.

In terms of Precision, E8-IJS run #0 obtains the highest values but at the expenses of low Recall. Similarly, Sunday-Rocker systems #0 and #4 obtain and BLUE #2 perfect Recall but with low Precision values. When considering the Precision-Recall trade-off, NLPGroup-IISERB #0 is the best performance being the only run over 0.7 (highest 𝐹 1). Regarding latency-penalized metrics, UNSL #2 and SCIR2 #3 obtained the best 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 50 and LauSAn #4 the best 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 error value.
