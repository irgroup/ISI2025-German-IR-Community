<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This work presents our solution to the problem of early depression detection proposed as a shared task in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,151.03,406.06,11.28,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since the appearance of social media and their exponential growth throughout the past decade in terms of users, the social media had become an important part of our daily life and opened a new ways to express ourselves. A study <ref type="bibr" coords="1,358.16,433.16,13.00,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> has shown that our behavior on social media is not very different from the one in real life, thus there is a possibility for inferring health related problems, especially mental illnesses such as depression from posts on social media. Due to this behaviour we consider utilizing machine learning methods to detect a sign of depression as early as possible by using natural language processing techniques. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the background and related work for detecting depression from texts using machine learning, then in Section 3 we describe the data that was given by the task's organizers, next, in Section 4 we describe our proposed methodology, in Section 7 we present our results obtained on the official test set and in Section 8 we present conclusions and further work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background and Related work</head><p>The problem of this work is defined as follows: Given a user and a list of their posts on the social platform Reddit, decide from which post onwards the user is depressed. Our goal is to develop a method that will process sequentially each round of posts from all users and determine if a user is depressed. If some post is labeled as depressing we consider the user as depressed, the assessment is final and their additional posts are not to be taken into account. Prior to this year's task, there were several proposed solutions using machine learning and natural language processing in the past few years on similar or almost identical tasks. Analyzing and profiling users on social-media represents an active research area. Argamon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,409.65,206.12,12.74,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> did the pioneering work in author profiling on the level of British National Corpora and concluded that man intend to write in less formal way. Litvinova et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.30,233.22,12.94,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> showed that the distinction via gender can be captured based on person's writing adjectives between male and female people. This hypothesis lead to several shared-tasks aimed at author-profiling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.64,260.32,11.27,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,340.63,260.32,7.44,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.79,260.32,7.44,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,360.95,260.32,7.44,10.91" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.11,260.32,7.44,10.91" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,381.27,260.32,12.51,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.51,260.32,12.51,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.74,260.32,12.26,10.91" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The shared-tasks profiled users on various parallels: gender, age, occupation, are the users potential spreaders of fake or hate news and so on. The highest-scoring approaches to these tasks included models that base on simpler linguistic features classified with either Support Vector Machine or Logistic Regression. Martinc et al <ref type="bibr" coords="2,208.43,314.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> focused on creating TF-IDF weighted n-gram features based both on word and character n-grams classified via Support Vector Machines. Koloski et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,488.18,328.07,17.80,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> improved the proposed approach by introducing singular-value-decomposition of the n-gram space. The proposed representation performed competitivly well in a multilignual setting, for the task of fake-news spreaders identification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.53,368.71,16.09,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In the domain of depression detection, Basile et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.88,382.26,17.95,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a solution to the task of depression detection with Hierarchical Attention Networks, constructed based on 20000 most-frequent words, initialized with the GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.91,395.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> embeddings. Campillo et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.54,409.36,18.01,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a solution using TF-IDF weighted representations derived from the word features, while for classification they utilized the Support Vector Machine model. Key feature to this work was that the authors also included the position of a given post in a series of posts, hypothesizing that a post earlier in the sequence can have higher impact on the class prediction. The BERT based architectures are also commonly used for detection of depression. One of the solutions including large pre-trained models is the method by Castaño et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.73,490.66,17.90,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where the authors used XLM-RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="2,319.29,490.66,17.90,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> with an additional classification head. Transfer-learning recently gained traction as a popular paradigm of utilizing knowledge of the language model that was acquired by solving an unsupervised task. Spartailis et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.57,517.76,17.99,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> used the aforementioned paradigm by utilizing SBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,309.56,531.30,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> with a combination of feature extraction via classical machine learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data set</head><p>The shared task consisted of two stages: a development and a test stage. In each stage we were given up to 𝑁 users and their corresponding 𝑘 posts, accompanied by a binary label (depressed or not-depressed). In the development stage, the organizers provided data for training that consisted of the training and test data from eRisk2017 edition and the test data from the eRisk2018 edition. A total of 1618 users were given. For each user up to 2000 posts were given.</p><p>The data was skewed towards non-depressed class, with more than 90% of the users labeled as non-depressed. In order to build and evaluate models internally, we split the data into a training (80% of the train data) and a development (20% of the train data) set with respect to class distributions. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,205.88,127.61,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the data distribution per each training split. For learning and modelling purposes, we first pair every given post per user with that user's corresponding binary label (depressed or not-depressed). In this manner we acquire 843,554 training data points and 204,874 testing data points. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methodology</head><p>We treat this problem as a binary document classification problem. In this section we describe the chosen document representations, followed by the classifier description and finally we explain our final task modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Document representation</head><p>We consider two different document representation methods: one based on Latent Semantic Analysis (see section 4.1.1) and one contextual based on the sentence transformers (see section 4.1.2). We use the implementation by Koloski et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,331.45,452.18,18.07,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in c19 python package <ref type="foot" coords="3,460.70,450.43,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . For the classification model we use the Logistic Regression model by scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.85,465.73,16.25,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Latent Semantic Analysis</head><p>For our first representation method we consider the <ref type="bibr" coords="3,312.35,514.68,17.76,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> implementation of LSA based on n-gram features recuded via SVD technique to create a new latent space of reduced dimensionality. The method has two hyper-parameters 𝑛 -the total number of n-gram features and 𝑑 the dimension of the latent space. The method first pre-processes the documents by removing the punctuation, the hashtags, the URLs and stop-words. Next, the POS-tags are extracted with the NLTK library <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,582.43,16.41,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The method constructs 𝑛 2 features on basis of TF-IDF weighted word uni-grams and bi-grams and 𝑛 2 features of TF-IDF weighted char bi-grams and tri-grams. Finally, SVD is applied in order to create the new latent space and simultaneously reduce the dimensionality to dimension 𝑑. We search extensively thought the parameter space 𝑛 = {500, 1000, 1500, 2000} and 𝑑 = {64, 128, 256, 512}. In our method the best-performing hyper-parameters were set to 𝑛 = 1000 and 𝑑 = 256 respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2.">Contextual Features</head><p>For our second method we considered to use a model from sentence-transformer library distilbertbase-nli-mean-tokens <ref type="bibr" coords="4,182.44,121.08,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> in order to map the writings to a dense vector space of 768 dimensions. Then, using the obtained vector representations we classify the writings using the aforementioned linear model.</p><p>Sentence-BERT is a BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,234.50,161.73,18.07,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> based model that it is used is to derive a semantically meaningful vector representations for documents on sentence-level. It has added a pooling operation in order to aggregate and generate the representations. We considered the following variants of SBERT model: distillBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,270.68,202.38,16.25,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="4,343.96,202.38,16.25,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, XLM-RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="4,445.08,202.38,16.25,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Final Classification</head><p>We train a Logistic Regression Classifier on top of these aforementioned features with penalty C set to 1. We learned a classifier on a given representation on the training set and evaluated on the development set. For evaluation measure we used the F1-score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">User classification</head><p>We start by processing the first post, if that one is predicted as depressive by our system we return depressing automatically for every next post. If not, we return that the user is not depressed and proceed to classify the next post. Once we find a post that is depressing, we proceed to automatically reply that the user is depressed until we finish. If there is no depressing post we return that the user is not depressed at every step up to the last query to our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Measures</head><p>The F1-score is calculated as a harmonic mean between precision and recall.</p><p>• Precision is a metric that provides us with the percentage of the positive predictions that are actually positive in the test set. • Recall is a metric that provides us with the proportion of the positive instances in the test set that are predicted as positive by our model. • F1-score is a harmonic mean of the precision and recall score.</p><p>• ERDE <ref type="bibr" coords="4,148.07,544.98,17.83,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is a metric that, was provided by the task's organizers, and penalizes the late response for correct predictions for depression. • speed is a metric that presents how fast the model predicts positive for the instances that are labeled as depressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Experiments and Evaluation Results</head><p>In the following Section we will describe the evaluation settings with the corresponding measures and the evaluation results -both on the internal and official test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Internal evaluation</head><p>In this subsection we explain our internal experimentation setup that was performed on the internal data split defined in Section 2, followed by the presentation of the results obtained in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,115.99,134.63,3.77,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. As described in the previous sections, we first construct a representation (in the case of LSA) or obtain it directly (in the case of sBERT) on the training set, and next we train a classifier that we evaluate on the development set. The LSA representation outscored the four other models in term of precision, achieving score of 0.5385. DistilBERT was next in line falling behind by 0.2301 percentage points in terms of precision, that was followed by XLM-RoBERTa and RoBERTa. In terms of recall best performing model was the RoBERTa model achieving score of 0.9524, followed by XLM-RoBERTa, while LSA was at the last place in terms of recall with score of 0.1667. The best-performing model in terms of F1-score was the DistilBERT model achieving score of 0.4430 percentage points, followed by XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa and finally LSA. The more granular evaluation of the DistilBERT model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,89.04,270.13,3.70,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We considered the LSA model for our first submission as it had highest precision, and as for the second submission we consider the DistilBERT since it has produced predictions with the highest F1 score.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Official Test Set Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,116.47,107.54,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> represents the results achieved on the official test set provided by the organizers. In addition to our results, we added the top three results performed by three other teams that also processed all 2000 writings for comparison. Our LSA solution achieved the best score in terms of Precision with a highest score of 0.684, while our second run based on RoBERTa achieved Recall score of 0.959 falling behind only by 4.1% behind the best recall score. In terms of latencyTP and speed we achieved the best score. Finally we ranked 8𝑡ℎ out of 13 places. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion and further work</head><p>In our attempt to solve this joint task proposed by CLEF, we considered using light machine learning models such as logistic regression on different input representations based on LSA and contextual features. Although we achieved a decent performance in terms of F1 score of 0.387, we still lag behind the top results in this task. On the other hand, we achieved the best precision with the first method and almost perfect recall with the second method, which shows the performance of our method in detecting depressed users and their early detection, as this method also performed quite well on the ERDE50 metric. The results of the proposed method on the official results indicate that false negatives are not well captured by the model (low recall), however, false positives are easily identified -this is not necessarily optimal for a practical application, where either F1 or recall can have a greater practical relevance, however, could indicate the method's usefulness in particular scenarios aimed to identify existing patients that were mis-treated. And it is still worth mentioning that we were one of the 7 teams that processed all the fonts, thanks to the low time consumption of our model, which also leads us to achieve the best speed on the track. Of course, we make predictions based on only one writing, and this output shows our direction for further improving these methods by using multiple writings to get a more meaningful feeling from users' writings. Additional further work can be done by improving the performance of our system via making ensembles of classifiers as trying to include background knowledge or test AutoML systems for automatic feature creation and classifier selection.</p></div>
