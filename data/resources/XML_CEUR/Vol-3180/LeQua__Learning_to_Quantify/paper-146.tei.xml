<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>LeQua 2022 is a new lab for the evaluation of methods for "learning to quantify" in textual datasets, i.e., for training predictors of the relative frequencies of the classes of interest ùí¥ = {ùë¶1, ..., ùë¶ùëõ} in sets of unlabelled textual documents. While these predictions could be easily achieved by first classifying all documents via a text classifier and then counting the numbers of documents assigned to the classes, a growing body of literature has shown this approach to be suboptimal, and has proposed better methods. The goal of this lab is to provide a setting for the comparative evaluation of methods for learning to quantify, both in the binary setting and in the single-label multiclass setting; this is the first time that an evaluation exercise solely dedicated to quantification is organized. For both the binary setting and the single-label multiclass setting, data were provided to participants both in ready-made vector form and in raw document form. In this overview article we describe the structure of the lab, we report the results obtained by the participants in the four proposed tasks and subtasks, and we comment on the lessons that can be learned from these results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In a number of applications involving classification, the final goal is not determining which class (or classes) individual unlabelled items (e.g., textual documents, images, or other) belong to, but estimating the prevalence (or "relative frequency", or "prior probability", or "prior") of each class ùë¶ ‚àà ùí¥ = {ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ } in the unlabelled data. Estimating class prevalence values for unlabelled data via supervised learning is known as learning to quantify (LQ) (or quantification, or supervised prevalence estimation) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,248.96,516.34,11.36,4.94" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,263.05,516.34,7.57,4.94" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>LQ has several applications in fields (such as the social sciences, political science, market research, epidemiology, and ecological modelling) which are inherently interested in characterising aggregations of individuals, rather than the individuals themselves; disciplines like the ones above are usually not interested in finding the needle in the haystack, but in characterising the haystack. For instance, in most applications of tweet sentiment classification we are not concerned with estimating the true class (e.g., Positive, or Negative, or Neutral) of individual tweets. Rather, we are concerned with estimating the relative frequency of these classes in the set of unlabelled tweets under study; or, put in another way, we are interested in estimating as accurately as possible the true distribution of tweets across the classes.</p><p>It is by now well known that performing quantification by classifying each unlabelled instance and then counting the instances that have been attributed to the class (the "classify and count" method) usually leads to suboptimal quantification accuracy (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.33,171.52,11.37,4.94" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.43,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.64,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.84,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.05,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.26,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.46,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.67,171.52,7.48,4.94" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,486.88,171.52,11.93,4.94" target="#b9">10]</ref>); this may be seen as a direct consequence of "Vapnik's principle" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.21,185.07,16.25,4.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which states If you possess a restricted amount of information for solving some problem, try to solve the problem directly and never solve a more general problem as an intermediate step. It is possible that the available information is sufficient for a direct solution but is insufficient for solving a more general intermediate problem.</p><p>In our case, the problem to be solved directly is quantification, while the more general intermediate problem is classification.</p><p>One reason why "classify and count" is suboptimal is that many application scenarios suffer from distribution shift, the phenomenon according to which the distribution across the classes ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ in the sample (i.e., set) ùúé of unlabelled documents may substantially differ from the distribution across the classes in the labelled training set ùêø; distribution shift is one example of dataset shift <ref type="bibr" coords="2,145.43,356.87,16.42,4.94" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.58,356.87,12.31,4.94" target="#b12">13]</ref>, the phenomenon according to which the joint distributions ùëù ùêø (x, ùë¶) and ùëù ùúé (x, ùë¶) differ. The presence of distribution shift means that the well-known IID assumption, on which most learning algorithms for training classifiers hinge, does not hold. In turn, this means that "classify and count" will perform suboptimally on sets of unlabelled items that exhibit distribution shift with respect to the training set, and that the higher the amount of shift, the worse we can expect "classify and count" to perform.</p><p>As a result of the suboptimality of the "classify and count" method, LQ has slowly evolved as a task in its own right, different (in goals, methods, techniques, and evaluation measures) from classification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.02,465.27,11.58,4.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The research community has investigated methods to correct the biased prevalence estimates of general-purpose classifiers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.47,478.82,11.24,4.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.28,478.82,7.42,4.94" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.28,478.82,7.49,4.94" target="#b4">5]</ref>, supervised learning methods specially tailored to quantification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.35,492.37,11.23,4.94" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.00,492.37,7.42,4.94" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.85,492.37,7.42,4.94" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,273.70,492.37,7.42,4.94" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,283.54,492.37,12.23,4.94" target="#b9">10]</ref>, evaluation measures for quantification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.15,492.37,16.31,4.94" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.88,492.37,12.23,4.94" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and protocols for carrying out this evaluation.

For the near future it is easy to foresee that the interest in LQ will increase, due (a) to the increased awareness that "classify and count" is a suboptimal solution when it comes to prevalence estimation, and (b) to the fact that, with larger and larger quantities of data becoming available and requiring interpretation, in more and more scenarios we will only be able to afford to analyse these data at the aggregate level rather than individually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The rationale for LeQua 2022</head><p>The LeQua 2022 lab (https://lequa2022.github.io/) at CLEF 2022 has a "shared task" format; it is a new lab, in two important senses:</p><p>‚Ä¢ No labs on LQ have been organized before at CLEF conferences.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Even outside the CLEF conference series, quantification has surfaced only episodically in previous shared tasks. The first such shared task was SemEval 2016 Task 4 "Sentiment Analysis in Twitter" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,209.54,131.97,16.33,4.94" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which comprised a binary quantification subtask and an ordinal quantification subtask (these two subtasks were offered again in the 2017 edition). Quantification also featured in the Dialogue Breakdown Detection Challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="3,457.63,159.06,16.14,4.94" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in the Dialogue Quality subtasks of the NTCIR-14 Short Text Conversation task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.62,172.61,16.42,4.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and in the NTCIR-15 Dialogue Evaluation task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,293.59,186.16,16.14,4.94" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, quantification was never the real focus of these tasks. For instance, the real focus of the tasks described by Nakov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,116.56,213.26,17.91,4.94" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was sentiment analysis on Twitter data, to the point that almost all participants in the quantification subtasks used the trivial "classify and count" method, and focused, instead of optimising the quantification component, on optimising the sentiment analysis component, or on picking the best-performing learner for training the classifiers used by "classify and count". Similar considerations hold for the tasks discussed in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,447.34,267.46,16.43,4.94" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,466.50,267.46,12.55,4.94" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,481.77,267.46,12.32,4.94" target="#b24">25]</ref>. This is the first time that a shared task whose explicit focus is quantification is organized. A lab on this topic was thus sorely needed, because the topic has great applicative potential, and because a lot of research on this topic has been carried out without the benefit of the systematic experimental comparisons that only shared tasks allow.</p><p>We expect the quantification community to benefit significantly from this lab. One of the reasons is that this community is spread across different fields, as also witnessed by the fact that work on LQ has been published in a scattered way across different areas, e.g., information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="3,128.45,384.03,11.23,4.94" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,142.21,384.03,7.43,4.94" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.15,384.03,12.23,4.94" target="#b15">16]</ref>, data mining <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.79,384.03,11.23,4.94" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,239.54,384.03,7.49,4.94" target="#b7">8]</ref>, machine learning <ref type="bibr" coords="3,331.79,384.03,16.30,4.94" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,350.61,384.03,12.23,4.94" target="#b26">27]</ref>, statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="3,409.89,384.03,16.09,4.94" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, or in the areas to which these techniques get applied <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.40,397.58,16.44,4.94" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,267.57,397.58,12.55,4.94" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,282.84,397.58,12.34,4.94" target="#b29">30]</ref>. In their papers, authors often use as baselines only the algorithms from their own fields; one of the goals of this lab was thus to pull together people from different walks of life, and to generate cross-fertilisation among the respective sub-communities.</p><p>While quantification is a general-purpose machine learning / data mining task that can be applied to any type of data, in this lab we focus on its application to data consisting of textual documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Setting up LeQua 2022</head><p>In quantification, a data item (usually represented as x) is the individual unit of information; for instance, a textual document, an image, a video, are examples of data items. In LeQua 2022, as data items we use textual documents (and, more specifically, product reviews). A document x has a label, i.e., it belongs to a certain class ùë¶ ‚àà ùí¥ = {ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ }; in this case we say that ùë¶ is the label of x. In LeQua 2022, classes are either merchandise classes for products, or sentiment classes for reviews (see Section 3.4 for more).</p><p>Some documents are such that their label is known to the quantification algorithm, and are thus called labelled items; we typically use them as training examples for the quantifier-training algorithm. Some other documents are such that their label is unknown to the quantifier-training algorithm and to the trained quantifier, and are thus called unlabelled items; for testing purposes we use documents whose label we hide to the quantifier. Unlike a classifier, a quantifier must not predict labels for individual documents, but must predict prevalence values for samples (i.e., sets) of unlabelled documents; a prevalence value for a class ùë¶ and a sample ùúé is a number in [0,1] such that the prevalence values for the classes in ùí¥ = {ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ } sum up to 1. Note that when, in the following, we use the term "label", we always refer to the label of an individual document (and not of a sample of documents; samples do not have labels, but prevalence values for classes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Tasks</head><p>Two tasks (T1 and T2) were offered within LeQua 2022, each admitting two subtasks (A and B).</p><p>In Task T1 (the vector task) participant teams were provided with vectorial representations of the (training / development / test) documents. This task was offered so as to appeal to those participants who are not into text learning, since participants in this task did not need to deal with text preprocessing issues. Additionally, this task allowed the participants to concentrate on optimising their quantification methods, rather than spending time on optimising the process for producing vectorial representations of the documents.</p><p>In Task T2 (the raw documents task), participant teams were provided with the raw (training / development / test) documents. This task was offered so as to appeal to those participants who wanted to deploy end-to-end systems, or to those who wanted to also optimise the process for producing vectorial representations of the documents (possibly tailored to the quantification task).</p><p>The two subtasks of both tasks were the binary quantification subtask (T1A and T2A) and the single-label multiclass quantification subtask (T1B and T2B); in both subtasks each document belongs to only one of the classes of interest ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ , with ùëõ = 2 in T1A and T2A and ùëõ &gt; 2 in T1B and T2B.</p><p>The four subtasks conceptually form a 2√ó2 grid, as illustrated in the following table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binary Multiclass (by sentiment)</head><p>(by topic)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T1A T1B</head><p>Raw Documents T2A T2B</p><p>For each subtask in { T1A, T1B, T2A, T2B }, participant teams were required not to use (training / development / test) documents other than those provided for that subtask. In particular, participants were explicitly advised against using any document from either T2A or T2B in order to solve either T1A or T1B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The evaluation protocol</head><p>As the protocol for generating the test samples on which the quantifiers will be tested we adopt the so-called artificial prevalence protocol (APP), which is by now a standard protocol for generating the datasets to be used in the evaluation of quantifiers. Using the APP consists of taking the test set ùëà of unlabelled data items, and extracting from it a number of subsets (the test samples), each characterised by a predetermined vector (ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ 1 ), ..., ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ ùëõ )) of prevalence values, where ùë¶ 1 , ..., ùë¶ ùëõ are the classes of interest. In other words, for extracting a test sample ùúé, we generate a vector of prevalence values, and randomly select documents from ùëà accordingly (i.e., by class-conditional random selection of documents until the desired class prevalence values are obtained). <ref type="foot" coords="5,180.82,216.56,3.71,3.61" target="#foot_0">1</ref>The goal of the APP is to generate samples characterised by widely different vectors of prevalence values; this is meant to test the robustness of a quantifier (i.e., of an estimator of class prevalence values) in confronting class prevalence values possibly different (or very different) from the ones of the set it has been trained on. For doing this we draw the vectors of class prevalence values uniformly at random from the set of all legitimate such vectors, i.e., from the unit (ùëõ -1)-simplex of all vectors (ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ 1 ), ..., ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ ùëõ )) such that ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ ùëñ ) ‚àà [0, 1] for all ùë¶ ùëñ ‚àà ùí¥ and ‚àëÔ∏Ä ùë¶ ùëñ ‚ààùí¥ ùëù ùúé (ùë¶ ùëñ ) = 1.

Note that we have used HDy and QuaNet as baselines only in T1A and T2A, since they are binary-only methods. All other methods are natively multiclass, so we have used them in all four subtasks.

As shown in in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,364.87,273.52,3.66,4.94">1</ref>, the most popular subtask was, unsurprisingly, T1A (5 teams), while the subtask with the smallest participation was T2B (1 team). We here list the teams in alphabetical order:</p><p>‚Ä¢ DortmundAI <ref type="bibr" coords="10,184.78,339.67,18.07,4.94" target="#b38">[39]</ref> submitted a run each for T1A and T1B. Their original goal was to use a modified version of the SLD algorithm described in Section 3.5. The modification introduced by DortmundAI consists of the use of a regularization technique meant to smooth the estimates that expectation maximization computes for the class prevalence values at each iteration. After extensively applying model selection, though, the team realized that the best configurations of hyperparameters often reduce the strength of such regularization, so as to make the runs produced by their regularized version of SLD almost identical to a version produced by using the "traditional" SLD algorithm. They also found that a thorough optimization of the hyperparameters of the base classifier was instead the key to producing good results. ‚Ä¢ KULeuven <ref type="bibr" coords="10,169.89,476.52,17.76,4.94" target="#b39">[40]</ref> submitted a run each for T1A and T1B. Their system consisted of a robust calibration of the SLD <ref type="bibr" coords="10,213.19,490.07,17.76,4.94" target="#b31">[32]</ref> method based on the observations of Molinari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,456.29,490.07,16.21,4.94" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. While the authors explored trainable calibration strategies (i.e., regularization constraints that modify the training objective of a classifier in favour of better calibrated solutions), the team finally contributed a solution based on the Platt rescaling <ref type="bibr" coords="10,398.60,530.72,17.92,4.94" target="#b41">[42]</ref> of the SVM outputs (i.e., a post-hoc calibration method that is applied after training the classifier) which they found to perform better in validation. Their solution differs from the version of SLD provided as baseline mainly in the choice of the underlying classifier (the authors chose SVMs while the provided baseline is based on logistic regression) and in the amount of effort devoted to the optimization of the hyperparameters (which was higher in the authors' case). ‚Ä¢ UniLeiden <ref type="bibr" coords="10,171.91,626.92,18.07,4.94" target="#b42">[43]</ref> submitted a run for T1A only.

The main modifications come down to computing the mean (instead of the median) of the class prevalence estimates by integrating over continuous functions (instead of summing across discrete functions) that represent the classification counts and misclassification rates. Since the underlying distributions of these counts and rates are unknown, kernel density estimation is used to approximate them. Although the system did not yield improved results with respect to MS, it paves the way for better understanding the theoretical implications of MS. ‚Ä¢ UniOviedo(Team1) <ref type="bibr" coords="11,209.64,172.88,17.76,4.94" target="#b44">[45]</ref> submitted a run each for all four subtasks. Their system consists of a deep neural network architecture explicitly devised for the quantification task. The learning method is non-aggregative and does not need to know the labels of the training items composing a sample. As the training examples to train the quantifiers that produced the submissions it used the samples with known prevalence from the development sets ùê∑ ùêµ and ùê∑ ùëÄ (each set is used for its respective task). A generator of additional samples that produces mixtures of pairs of samples of known prevalence is used to increase the number of training examples. Data from training sets ùêø ùêµ and ùêø ùëÄ are used only to generate additional training samples when over-fitting is observed. Every sample is represented as a set of histograms, each one representing the distribution of values of an input feature. For tasks T1A and T1B, histograms are directly computed on the input vectors. For tasks T2A and T2B, the input text are first converted into dense vectors using a BERT model, for which the histograms are computed. The network uses RAE as the loss function, modified by the smoothing parameter so as to avoid undefined values when a true prevalence is zero, thus directly optimizing the official evaluation measure. ‚Ä¢ UniOviedo(Team2) <ref type="bibr" coords="11,210.02,377.47,17.76,4.94" target="#b45">[46]</ref> submitted a run each for T1A and T1B. For T1A, this team used a highly optimized version of the HDy system (that was also one of the baseline systems), obtained by optimizing three different parameters (similarity measure used, number of bins used, method used for binning the posteriors returned by the classifier). For T1B, this team used a version of HDy (called EDy) different from the previous one; EDy uses, for the purpose of measuring the distance between two histograms, the "energy distance" in place of the Hellinger Distance.</p><p>‚Ä¢ UniPadova <ref type="bibr" coords="11,174.87,473.67,18.07,4.94" target="#b46">[47]</ref> submitted a run for T2A only. Their system consisted of a classifyand-count method in which the underlying classifier is a probabilistic "BM25" classifier. The power of this method thus only derives from the term weighting component, since nothing in the method makes explicit provisions for distribution shift.</p></div>

Each team could submit up to two runs per subtask, provided each such run used a truly different method (and not, say, the same method using different parameter values); however, no team decided to take advantage of this, and each team submitted at most  one run per subtask. An instantiation of Codalab (https://codalab.org/) was set up in order to allow the teams to submit their runs. The true labels of the unlabelled test sets were released on May 13, 2022, after the submission period was over and the official results had been announced to the participants.

Interestingly enough, no system (either participants' system or baseline system) was the best performer in more than one subtask, with four different systems (the KULeuven system for T1A, the DortmundAI system for T1B, the QuaNet baseline system for T2A, and the UniOviedo(Team1) system for T2B) claiming top spot for the four subtasks. Overall, the performance of UniOviedo(Team1) was especially noteworthy since, aside from topping the rank in T2B, it obtained results not statistically significantly different (0.05 ‚â§ ùëù-value) from those of the top-performing team also in T1A and T1B.</p><p>The results allow us to make a number of observations. We organize the discussion of these results in four sections (Section 5.1 to Section 5.4), one for each of the four dimensions (vectors vs. raw documents, binary vs. multiclass) according to which the four subtasks are structured. However, before doing that, we discuss some conclusions that may be drawn from the results and that affect all four dimensions. 1. MLPE is the worst predictor. This is true in all four subtasks, and was expected, given the fact that the test data are generated by means of the APP, which implies that the test data contain a very high number of samples characterized by substantial distribution shift, and that on these samples MLPE obviously performs badly. 2. CC and PCC obtain very low quantification accuracy; this is the case in all four subtasks, where these two methods are always near the bottom of the ranking. This confirms the fact (already recorded in previous work -see e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="13,370.44,632.20,16.55,4.94" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,390.58,632.20,12.59,4.94" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="13,406.75,632.20,13.07,4.94" target="#b47">48]</ref>) that they are not good performers when the APP is used for generating the dataset, i.e., they are not good performers when there is substantial distribution shift. Interestingly enough, CC always outperforms PCC, which was somehow unexpected.  3. ACC and PACC are mid-level performers; this holds in all four subtasks, in which both methods are always in the middle portion of the ranking. Interestingly enough, PACC always outperforms ACC, somehow contradicting the impression (see Bullet 2) that "hard" counts are better than expected counts and/or that the calibration routine has not done a good job. 4. SLD is the strongest baseline; this is true in all four subtasks, in which SLD, while never being the best performer, is always in the top ranks. This confirms the fact (already recorded in previous work -see e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,287.47,578.96,16.56,4.94" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,307.02,578.96,12.59,4.94" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,322.60,578.96,13.07,4.94" target="#b47">48]</ref>) that SLD is a very strong performer when the APP is used for generating the dataset, i.e., when the test data contain many samples characterized by substantial distribution shift. 5. Overall, the ranking MLPE &lt; PCC &lt; CC &lt; ACC &lt; PACC &lt; SLD (where "&lt;" means "performs worse than") clearly emerges from all four tasks.</p><p>As it might be expected, not always a good performance according to RAE (our official measure) also corresponds to a good performance on AE (our other measure). Only in 2 subtasks out of 4  (T1B, with the DortmundAI system, and T2A, with the QuaNet baseline system) the system that scores best according to RAE also scores best according to AE; in the other 2 subtasks this is not the case, and in one case (T2B) the system that performs best according to RAE (the UniOviedo(Team1) system) has a very low performance according to AE. This suggests that for some systems, including the UniOviedo(Team1) system, parameter optimization (which, quite naturally, is performed by trying to optimize the official measure) may have played an especially important role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">T1A and T1B: The vector subtasks</head><p>In the vector subtasks the top-performing systems, KULeuven for T1A and UniDortmund for T1B, both consist of carefully optimized instances of SLD. The KULeuven system outperformed all the baseline systems in both tasks, while the UniDortmund system ranked 5th in T1A, one position below the SLD baseline. The runs from UniOviedo(Team1) and UniOviedo(Team2) obtained 2nd and 3rd ranks, respectively, in both T1A and T1B. The UniOviedo(Team1) system performed very well in both cases, obtaining RAE scores that, according to the test of statistical significance, are not significantly different from the best result obtained in each of these subtasks. Things are different if we instead look at the AE scores, for which UniOviedo(Team1) obtained the best result in T1A but the second-worst result in T1B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">T2A and T2B: The raw documents subtasks</head><p>In both raw document tasks (T2A and T2B) the best-performing methods is always one based on deep learning (the QuaNet baseline for T2A and the UniOviedo(Team1) system for T2B).</p><p>A direct comparison between the UniOviedo(Team1) system and QuaNet in the multiclass case (T2B) is not possible because QuaNet is a binary-only method (see Section 3.5) and was thus not used in T2B. A common characteristic between these two methods is that both use (part of the) samples from the validation data not for tuning hyperparameters but for training the model.</p><p>Concerning the baseline systems, the results do not give a definitive answer on which between tfidf and RoBERTa is the best method for mapping raw documents into vectors. In fact, out of 9 cases (5 for T2A, 4 for T2B) in which we have generated both variants of the same baseline, the tfidf variant outperforms the RoBERTa variant in 4 cases and is outperformed by it in 5 cases. This was unexpected, since RoBERTa is a way more sophisticated and modern method than the time-worn tfidf. Interestingly (and mysteriously) enough, the tfidf variant is almost always the better performer in the binary case (T2A -4 cases out of 5), while the RoBERTa variant always outperforms the tfidf variant in the multiclass case (T2B -4 cases out of 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">T1A and T2A: The binary subtasks</head><p>Concerning T1A and T2A (the binary subtasks), we should first observe that we here use two further baseline systems, namely, HDy and QuaNet; we only use them in the binary subtasks since they are not natively multiclass. HDy performs fairly well in both T1A and T2A, outperforming MLPE, PCC, CC, ACC, and PACC (but not SLD) in both cases. Instead, QuaNet performs less consistently, since it places in the mid-lower ranks of the table in T1A but is no less than the best performer in T2A.</p><p>The inconsistent results obtained by QuaNet on binary tasks contrast with those obtained by the UniOviedo(Team1) system, the other method based on deep learning, which ranks among the top positions in both T1A and T2A. This is somehow surprising, given that in T1A (unlike in T2A), the source vectors used by UniOviedo(Team1) and QuaNet methods were exactly the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">T1B and T2B: The multiclass subtasks</head><p>Regarding the multiclass subtasks, the UniOviedo(Team1) system stands out, since it consistently obtained results that either outperform all other methods (T2B) or were not different, in a statistically significant sense, from the best-performing method (T1B). UniOviedo(Team1) was the only team participating in the raw-document multiclass subtask T2B. Although UniOviedo(Team1) beat all other baselines in terms of RAE, it performed comparably worse in terms of AE to most of the baselines (actually, worse than all baselines but MLPE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Final remarks</head><p>Overall, something that we learn from this shared task is that SLD is very hard to beat (thereby confirming recent results reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="16,261.66,672.84,16.55,4.94" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,281.39,672.84,12.59,4.94" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,297.16,672.84,11.92,4.94" target="#b47">48]</ref>), and that it tends to fare very well across different settings, including binary and multiclass quantification problems, and including different ways of processing text. This observation is reinforced by the fact that two of the best-performing systems (KULeuven and UniDortmund, which placed 1st in T1A and T1B, respectively) actually consist of carefully-tuned instances of SLD. Another "classic" method that has also proven to behave well is HDy, a method that forms the basis on which one of the best-performing methods (UniOviedo(Team2)) is built upon. However, the system that has delivered the most consistently competitive results across all tasks (UniOviedo(Team1)) is a "non-classical" one, since it is based on deep-learning technology.</p><p>To conclude, we think that LeQua 2022 has proven very useful for the quantification community, since it has confirmed, in a controlled settings, some intuitions about "classic" quantification systems (e.g., SLD) that had already surfaced in the recent literature, but has also shown that there are margins of improvement over them, especially if using "deep" learning approaches (such as QuaNet and the system used by UniOviedo(Team1)).</p><p>We plan to propose a LeQua edition for CLEF 2023, so as to allow the LeQua 2022 participants to profit from their 2022 experience in order to consolidate their systems so as to improve on their 2022 performance, and so as to allow prospective participants who could not make it for 2022 to jump in. The experimental setting that we have used for LeQua 2022 will be the starting point, but we might want to incorporate in it possible suggestions that might arise during the LeQua session at the CLEF 2022 conference. This session will host (a) a keynote talk by George Forman (Amazon Research), (b) a detailed presentation by the organisers, overviewing the lab and the results of the participants, (c) oral presentations by the participating teams, and (d) a final discussion on the takeaway message that LeQua 2022 gives us.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,107.28,608.63,398.70,9.76;7,116.56,621.93,390.62,9.60;8,116.56,87.70,389.41,10.63;8,116.56,101.25,333.76,9.57;8,107.28,116.36,398.70,9.76;8,116.56,129.70,389.42,9.57;8,116.56,145.78,154.08,4.94;8,107.28,158.36,398.70,9.76;8,116.56,174.23,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,185.25,389.63,9.57;8,116.56,201.33,286.19,4.94;8,107.28,213.91,398.70,9.76;8,116.56,227.25,389.42,9.57;8,116.16,243.33,389.82,4.94;8,116.56,256.88,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,267.90,389.42,9.57;8,116.56,283.98,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,297.53,53.39,4.94;8,107.28,310.11,398.71,9.76;8,116.56,325.98,390.62,4.94;8,116.56,339.53,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,353.08,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,364.10,389.42,9.57;8,116.56,380.18,389.42,4.94;8,116.56,391.20,389.42,9.57;8,116.56,407.28,103.47,4.94;8,107.28,419.86,260.04,9.76"><head>‚Ä¢</head><label></label><figDesc>Classify and Count (CC): This is the trivial baseline, consisting in training a standard classifier ‚Ñé on the training set ùêø, using it to classify all the data items x in the sample ùúé, counting how many such items have been attributed to class ùë¶ ùëñ , doing this for all classes in ùí¥, and dividing the resulting counts by the cardinality |ùúé| of the sample.‚Ä¢ Probabilistic Classify and Count (PCC)<ref type="bibr" coords="8,303.80,118.68,11.40,4.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>: This is a probabilistic variant of CC where the "hard" classifier ‚Ñé is replaced with a "soft" (probabilistic) classifier ùë†, and where counts are replaced with expected counts. ‚Ä¢ Adjusted Classify and Count (ACC)<ref type="bibr" coords="8,288.70,160.68,16.27,4.94" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: This is an "adjusted" variant of CC in which the prevalence values predicted by CC are subsequently corrected by considering the misclassification rates of classifier ‚Ñé, as estimated on a held-out validation set.
