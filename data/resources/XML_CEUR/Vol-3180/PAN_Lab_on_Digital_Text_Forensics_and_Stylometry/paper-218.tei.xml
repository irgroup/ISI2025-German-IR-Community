One relevant aspect is that text from different authors in multi-authored documents presents topic similarity due to the nature of the dataset: StackExchange Q&amp;A. As usual, the task organizers provide the TIRA platform <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.72,168.26,17.77,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to perform all the heavy computations by the competitor's models. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of our model, its stages that eventually lead to predictions, and the task specifications released in the competition. Section 3 shows up our developed experiments and results. Section 4 summarize our findings and present the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Our proposal</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Task's specifications</head><p>All the tasks to be solved are described by the organizers in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.31,315.60,17.91,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> Task 1 aims to find the position of a style change for a text written by two authors that contains a single style change (i.e., cut the text into the two authors' texts on the paragraph-level). For Task 2 given a text written by two or more authors, the objective is to find all positions of writing style change (i.e., assign all paragraphs of the text uniquely to some author out of the number of authors assumed for the multi-author document). Finally, in the Task 3 for a text written by two or more authors, the challenge is to find all positions of writing style change, where style changes now not only occur between paragraphs but at the sentence level. Description of all three tasks is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,320.64,437.54,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model overview</head><p>Our model stands that a text document could be represented with three different approaches. The first one is centered on the semantic weight of a document. To do so, it was used three well-known embedding models: multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, all-MiniLM-L12-v2, and all-mpnetbase-v2; all of them are Bidirectional Encoder from Transformers (BERT) models for Sentence Similarity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.30,541.47,11.28,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It was chosen multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1 since it maps sentences and paragraphs to a normalized 384-dimensional dense vector space and was designed for semantic search. The second embedding model was selected since it was designed to be used as a sentence and short paragraph encoder. The last model was selected since it remains the best quality model of all sentence-transformers models <ref type="foot" coords="2,221.95,593.91,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> and it is intended to perform sentence similarity tasks <ref type="foot" coords="2,466.30,593.91,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> . All the three models were fine-tuned overall (Title, Answer) pairs from the StackExchange dataset, as reported by its developers. It was decided to choose more than one embedding model to capture The second representation of a text document is based on punctuation marks, which looks to capture the writing style of an author based on its use of punctuation marks such as emojis, text punctuation, and special characters. The final representation our models holds is based on the use of discourse markers or auxiliary words because they lead to discrimination between some author the others. Was used in both cases, the Punctuation Representation and the Auxiliary Words Representation the Part-of-Speech (POS) and morphological features tagging module stanza from Stanford NLP-Group. <ref type="foot" coords="3,498.20,433.42,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">5</ref>The model combines these three representations to use a similarity measure between documents influenced by the different stylographic characteristics that each representation could capture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Model Architecture</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Semantic, Punctuation and Auxiliary Words Representation</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,180.42,532.57,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> the model encodes all paragraphs/sentences 6 within a document from the dataset to a normalized 384-dimensional dense vectors (embeddings) to build the Semantic Representation (SR) of a given author entry. Secondly, it is computed a Punctuation marks term frequency vector which holds the number of occurrences of a given punctuation mark in the author entry. The possible terms this vector could have are precomputed finding the dataset vocabulary punctuation marks. This vector gives the model the capability to quantify the punctuation writing style similarity between different authors and belongs to the Punctuation Marks Representation (PMR) in the model. Lastly, an auxiliary word term frequency vector is calculated in the same way the PMR builds its vector. The possible terms this vector could have are any token in text tagged as a determiner, conjunction, adposition, pronoun, auxiliary, or adverb. This final vector captures stylistic features regarding the use of discourse markers in speech and belongs to the Auxiliary Words Representation (AWR). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Similarities between author entries</head><p>To get a quantification of how similar two author entries are was proposed a method for each given representation. In the SR was computed a paragraph-level similarity for Task 2. Every paragraph for Task 2 has an associated built embedding vector list corresponding to each sentence from the paragraph encoded using transformers. As the model represents an author entry as a three-embedding vector tuple, the similarity between two author entries is computed by taking the mean similarity between all embedding vectors. Hence, the model can calculate the semantic similarity by taking the mean from the highest vector embedding pair similarities (𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) where 𝑖 represents the i th sentence embedding vector from a document 𝐴 and 𝑗 represents the j th sentence embedding vector from a document 𝐵, such 𝑖, 𝑗 not associated. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,444.06,563.39,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Was calculated the cosine similarity from two vectors as usual:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,219.89,597.39,286.75,25.50">𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 ) = cos (𝜃) = 𝑣 1 .𝑣 2 ‖𝑣 1 ‖‖𝑣 2 ‖<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Being 𝑣 1 and 𝑣 2 vectors embeddings from two sentences. In the graph above, the numbers on the lines connecting two sentences represent the greatest cosine similarities between the embeddings of the encodings of the sentences in paragraph A and the sentences in paragraph B. The general similarity value of paragraph A and B would be the average of these similarities (i.e 0.85). This approach seeks to avoid the influence in the comparison of documents (paragraphs) with different amounts of sentences and to build the similarity based on the most similar sentences. The model computes both, the PMR similarity and AWR similarity obtaining the cosine similarity between the associated term frequency vectors belonging to each paragraph author.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Style change detection method</head><p>So far, the model can respond to how similar any paragraph/sentence within a document to any of the three representations are. At Task 1 was taken an unsupervised approach based on similarities between consecutive paragraphs. Since the goal of the task was to predict were occur the only style change in the document, was chosen the change position at the pair of a consecutive paragraphs with the lowest similarity. It was proposed that should exist thresholds 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜃 such that for each representation its corresponding similarity determines whether a style change has occurred. This idea was taken for Task 2 and Task 3 and it is illustrated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,157.46,538.24,349.18,63.53">𝑆𝐶𝐷(𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 1 ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 𝑆𝑅_𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 ) &lt; 𝛽 𝑃 𝑀 𝑅_𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 ) &lt; 𝛾 𝐴𝑊 𝑅_𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 ) &lt; 𝜃 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>Were 𝐷 1 , 𝐷 2 are paragraph/sentences entries within a document. Was provided two methods of SCD when all representations were used, the first one considers a style change if all the criteria in 2 hold. This method was called Strong Criterion Style Change Detection. The second one was less sensitive to style changes and consider a style change if the majority of criteria in 2 holds. It was labeled this method as Soft Criterion Style Change Detection. <ref type="foot" coords="6,179.91,98.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">7</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4.">Assignment of paragraphs in Task 2</head><p>In Task 2 it is required to assign all the paragraphs of the text to only one author from the number of authors assumed for the multi-author document. To do so, a solution is given in Algorithm 1. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dataset Specification</head><p>The dataset used by our model is composed of Stack Exchange<ref type="foot" coords="6,372.99,582.72,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">8</ref> entries. The dataset corpora were split into three partitions: train, validation, and test. The distribution of data is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,115.79,611.57,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Parameter fitting</head><p>Our model parameters were the thresholds 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜃. Was found optimal values for these parameters by getting the three representations (SR, PMR, AWR) in the training dataset. Then, it was possible to determine the mean value of each similarity representation in author entries where a style change occurred and author entries where a style change did not take place. Results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,184.82,282.84,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="7,221.85,282.84,5.07,10.91">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="7,275.62,282.84,3.74,10.91">4</ref>. Was estimated the parameters of the models 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜃 per task as the mean where style change occurs. Every similarity lower than the specified value should be taken as non-similar documents (i. e) a style change occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Developed experiments</head><p>To evaluate the predictions over the dataset these measures were taken into count: the F1-Score (for the three tasks), the Diarization Error Rate (DER), and the Jaccard Error Rate (JER) for Task 2. <ref type="bibr" coords="8,99.95,134.63,17.91,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> Once the parameters were fixed, was possible to test our approach by tacking the released validation dataset and which representations should be considered, allowing us to test specific representations and their combinations. In Table <ref type="table" coords="8,300.32,175.28,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_2">5</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="8,335.36,175.28,4.97,10.91">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="8,385.96,175.28,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_3">7</ref> the obtained experimental results are shown. In Table <ref type="table" coords="8,138.91,575.70,5.07,10.91">8</ref> it is shown the results achieved on the test dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Results analysis</head><p>The representations used, prove not to be very effective when tested independently for Tasks 1 and 2. The unsupervised approach presented in Task 1 obtains the best results using all the representations. In Task 2, the results show a better F1 measurement for the Strong Criterion SCD version vs. the Soft Criterion SCD version, although the best results for the task were not The work was focused on testing the Strong Criterion SCD vs. the Soft Criterion SCD and that is the reason why it was included these approaches in competition test runs. The results from the test dataset over the validation dataset were consistent with the validation tests, exposing a low-variance and high-bias model. These methods tend to identify more authors than expected, so it is important to evaluate strategies that reduce the significance of features that are frequent at the document level and focus on those features that characterize the paragraph over the document.</p><p>For test run 1 of Task 2, the Soft Criterion SCD version combining all representations reported a DER measure of 0.4035 and a JER measure of 0.5771.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>Style Change Detection is a very interesting and challenging investigation field in Natural Language Processing. This work shows the results obtained by the UO-UDC team in the Style Change Detection Shared Task at the PAN22 competition. This paper presented all approaches taken by each of the proposed tasks and the results obtained by each strategy. We believe that adding some other writing style representations to the model could improve the system's effectiveness in expressing style changes, (e.g) could be added a phonetic representation from words or characters n-grams, and study for each paragraph the elements that define it self respect frequent elements in the document.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,290.76,417.34,8.93;3,89.29,301.83,117.88,9.96;3,89.29,84.19,416.69,199.99"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: PAN 2022 Style change detection sub tasks (https://pan.webis.de/clef22/pan22-web/ style-change-detection.html)</figDesc><graphic coords="3,89.29,84.19,416.69,199.99" type="bitmap" /></figure>
