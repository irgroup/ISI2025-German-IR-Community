<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem we address in this work is classifying whether a Twitter user has spread Irony and Stereotype or not. We used a text vectorization layer to generate Bag-Of-Words sequences. Then such sequences are passed to three different text classifiers (Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural Network, Naive Bayes). Our final classifier is an SVM. To test and validate our approach we used the dataset provided for the author profiling task organized by PAN@CLEF 2022. Our team (missino) submitted the predictions on the provided test set to participate at the shared task. Over several cross fold validation our approach was able to reach a maximum binary accuracy on the best validation split equal to 0.9474. On the test set provided for the shared task our model is able to reach an accuracy of 0.9389.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The organizers of "Profiling spreaders of irony and stereotype on Twitter" task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,436.79,412.46,12.70,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> at PAN 2022 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,89.29,426.01,13.00,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provided 200 tweets per 420 users, where half of the users are confirmed to have spread Irony and Stereotype (IS) on Twitter and the other half have not. Task participants are required to develop techniques to separate the IS spreaders from the non IS (nIS) spreaders. Differently from previous years, the organizers provided an English dataset only. Indeed, in the previous edition of the author profiling task, a Spanish dataset, for multilingual approaches, was also provided.</p><p>To address the task, we propose an SVM as a last stage classifier. In the first stage a text vectorization layer is used to generate Bag-Of-Words sequences. Then such sequences are passed to three different text classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Naive Bayes-based model (NB). Predictions made by these three classifiers are provided to the final classifier (i.e. SVM) which provides the final prediction. Our final predictions on the unlabeled samples on the provided dataset were submitted on TIRA platform <ref type="bibr" coords="1,423.92,575.05,11.27,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The remaining of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some related works on similar text classification tasks. In Section 3 we describe our approach in detail. In Section 4 we present our results. In Section 5 we conclude our paper and in Section 6 we discuss some future work.</p></div>

For example, in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.99,199.79,12.94,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> author proposes an SVM classifier with character and word n-gram features to determine whether the author of a Twitter feed is keen to be a spreader of fake news. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,277.40,226.89,18.07,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> authors developed systems that use character n-grams as features in combination with a linear SVM and Logistic Regression (LR) depending on the language (e.g., English or Spanish). Using SVM and LR, authors in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,421.37,253.99,16.39,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, explored how powerful and scalable matrix factorization-based classification can be in a multilingual setting, where the learner is presented with the data from multiple languages simultaneously.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The dataset</head><p>A shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,172.28,563.92,3.81,10.91">1</ref>, the PAN 2022 Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on Twitter task consists of an English corpus containing 600 XML files. Each of these files contains 200 tweets from a Twitter user. Because of the size of the corpus, we avoided splitting the corpus into a training and a development set. Instead, we used cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting. The dataset provided all URLs, hashtags and user mentions which were changed to standardized tokens. However we performed an additional preprocessing step on the provided dataset to remove the tag documents, CDATA and author from each sample in the dataset. Finally we lowercased all characters in the dataset. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The proposed model</head><p>Our proposed model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,274.84,435.04,3.81,10.91">1</ref>. After a TextVectorization 1 layer we provided the tokenized text to the CNN, Naive Bayes and Decison Tree classifiers. The Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are implemented using the scikit-learn package while for the CNN we implemented the shallow network discussed in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.70,475.69,16.25,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>After we collected the prediction from CNN, Naive Bayes and the Decision Tree on each sample of the dataset, we provided these predictions as input to an SVM. Same pipeline is implemented both for training and testing phase of our model. During the training phase we provide predictions related labels to the SVM. For the test phase we provided the unlabelled sample from the test set to the CNN, Naive Bayes and the Decision Tree. Providing the output predictions from these classifiers as input to the SVM, we collected the final prediction to be submitted on TIRA. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Experimental setup</head><p>We developed our software using the Python language (version 3.7) on Google Colab<ref type="foot" coords="4,460.29,241.75,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">2</ref> . To build our models we mainly used the scikit-learn<ref type="foot" coords="4,283.05,255.30,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> package, numpy <ref type="foot" coords="4,363.31,255.30,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> and TensorFlow<ref type="foot" coords="4,442.25,255.30,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">5</ref> . Our code is available Google Drive as a Jupyter Notebook<ref type="foot" coords="4,292.34,268.84,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">6</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,126.57,329.23,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref> are shown the results obtained by the single classifiers used and by the SVM ensamble on the best running fold over a 5-fold cross validation. Results of the SVM are obtained using as samples the predictions of the first layer classifier over the five folds.</p><p>As can be noted the performance of the SVM ensamble significantly outperforms single classifiers within our proposed framework. However the standard deviation over the five folds is not smaller with regards to the CNN and Naive Bayes. As communicated by the organizers, on the test set provided our model is able to reach an accuracy of 0.9389.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this notebook, we summarized our work process of preparing a software for the PAN 2022 Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on Twitter task. To find the best performing models we performed a 5-fold cross validation over the labelled samples in the dataset. After finding the models achieving the best accuracies during the cross-validation, we fitted these on the best fold training set. Then we trained an SVM on the predictions of the three chosen classifiers. So for our final software, we decided to create a model which was a classifiers taking as input the predictions of three parallel classifiers (CNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree). For each sub-model, we used grid search and cross-validation to find the best performing parameters and fitted the models on the best training data with these parameters. To get a final prediction for each user, we trained an SVM that used the predictions of the sub-models as features. Using the ensemble model, we were able to achieve improved performances over all tests. Overall, our final model was able to identify IS spreaders with a maximum binary accuracy of 0.9474 on a single fold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Future work</head><p>We assume that it would be beneficial to conduct some qualitative research about the tweets in the dataset to better understand the vocabulary used by IS and nIS spreaders. Another promising direction for achieving higher accuracy in profiling IS spreaders is to test several other first-stage classifiers. Perhaps implementing some transformer-based model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,385.20,199.79,16.34,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Such models could be employed both as a first stage classifier or as the final ensemble predictor. Another way could be using some pre-trained embedding from common transformer as ELECTRA <ref type="bibr" coords="5,410.87,226.89,22.66,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> or RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="5,484.65,226.89,21.33,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> instead of a simple Text Vectorization layer.</p><p>Another interesting aspect to further investigate is about the number of relevant tweets containing irony and stereotype in the feed of authors labelled as IS spreaders. Finally, some additional form of noise removal from the actual dataset could be performed to improve the overall performances of the proposed ensamble. </p></div>
