<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figurative language is using words in a way that deviates from the conventional order and meaning in order to ask the reader or listener to understand the meaning by virtue of its relation to some other meaning or concept. It is a rapidly growing area in Natural Language Processing, including the processing of irony, sarcasm, as well as other figures. With irony, language is employed in a figurative and subtle way to mean the opposite of what is literally stated. In this paper, we hypothesize that encoding dependency information allows us to find word associations that capture the author's style where the main intent is to spread stereotypes in the form of irony. To do this end, we proposed a graph convolutional network that is able to learn the heterogeneous text graphs, representing various dependency information in the text, which enables classifiers to classify ironic and non-ironic spreaders via looking at heterogeneous features. Experimental results are very promising and show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The raising of computational social science in social media challenges modern computational linguistics and text analytics. The challenge concerns the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) methodologies toward the transformation of manuscripts into structured data for the identification of special text characteristics, such as irony and stereotypes content.</p><p>Figurative language (FL) seems ubiquitous in all social media discussion forums and chats, posing extra challenges for linguistics. The main FL expression forms are sarcasm, irony, and stereotypes. With irony, language is employed in an FL way to mean the opposite to what is stated, which in the matter of sarcasm (a more aggressive type of irony) the intent is to scorn a viction. On the other hand, stereotypes are often used in discussions about controversial issues such as immigration or sexism and misogyny. The challenging part is the user behaviors in social media since users tend to violate common grammar and vocabulary rules and even use various FL forms to communicate their message. In past years emergence of research in this area got lots of interest and this year, at the Author Profiling (AP) task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.55,195.36,12.88,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in PAN <ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.11,195.36,12.88,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> the emphasis will be given to those authors that employ irony to spread stereotypes. The task has been defined as follows:</p><p>Given a Twitter feed in English, determine whether its author spreads Irony and Stereotypes.</p><p>Where input data is timelines of authors sharing Irony and Stereotypes towards, for instance, women or the LGTB community <ref type="foot" coords="2,234.22,291.35,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The major concern is to identify authors that spread ironic content. The task was designed to consider a subset of authors that employs irony to convey stereotypes in order to investigate the state-of-the-art models capability in this domain. So, the given authors tweets, and the proposed models should profile those that can be considered ironic spreaders.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related works. Section 3 describes the method. Section 4 describes the experimental setups such as dataset, metrics, and training setups. Next, in section 5 we discussed results and analysis. Finally, section 6 presents our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>In recent years AP considers the major topics in social media analysis topics such as bot-gender <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,473.53,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, fake news <ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.77,473.53,11.28,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, hate speech <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.77,473.53,11.28,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and this year irony identifications. The difference between AP tasks from others is the nature of AP is to identify authors that trying to spread figurative content. Each year, authors have done major preprocessing, feature engineering, and classifications. Due to the complex nature of the task, and to avoid any bias, organizers introduced balanced datasets to keep participants away from the challenge of imbalanced classification problems and allow them to focus on the problem itself. To this end, most of the authors heavily relied on preprocessing and representation parts to overcome the challenge. The representations mostly included such as n-grams, stylistics, personality, and deep learning-based feature engineering methods such as embeddings to extract high-level features to feed machine learning or deep learning models. In previous years, word/character level n-grams representations with SVM classifier and LDSE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.90,609.02,12.96,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> showed us a strong baseline. Analyzing these models and participant approaches reveals that word occurrences are playing a vital role in solving these challenges rather than the semantic aspect of the task. Many approaches are proposed for AP but no one tried Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.85,649.67,12.79,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to capture the word and authors associations. In this work, we proposed a model to learn the graph representations to identify irony and stereotype spreaders on Twitter.</p><p>Stereotypes are a type of social bias increasingly present in human interaction in social networks. This challenging task is being studied by computational linguistics because of the rise of hate messages, offensive language, sarcasm, and discrimination that many people receive. From the sarcastic argument, in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.93,154.71,12.68,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> work, the authors proposed a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model to capture the stylistic information via statistical and contextualized features. Their analysis reveals that word co-occurrences play a vital role in detecting sarcastic contents. In hate messages, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,493.25,181.81,12.74,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> showed the effectiveness of word/char n-gram features with LDSE in capturing co-occurrence features. In addition to co-occurrence representation, the contextualized features showed to be effective in hate speech spreaders detection. Moreover, in offensive language, at toxic span detection task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.14,236.01,18.07,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed an ensemble feature to enrich the representation for detecting phrases that make context toxic. All of the research tried to enrich the representations to achieve high-quality features for classifications. However, in profiling authors in AP tasks in social media, no one considered heterogeneous features using graphs except in similar work to our work, the <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.12,290.20,17.91,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> introduced graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for abusive content profiling. They showed that heterogeneous graph-structured modeling of communities significantly advances the current state-of-the-art in abusive language detection.</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" coords="3,119.35,330.85,17.76,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed two different approaches for identifying stereotypes in social media, a deep learning model based on Transformers; and a text masking technique that has been recognized for its capabilities to deliver good and human-understandable results. Moreover, in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,459.70,357.95,17.90,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> a task from SemEval 2019 studied hate speech content against immigrants and women in English and Spanish. The <ref type="bibr" coords="3,175.03,385.05,18.07,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> studied affective content role in irony identification at Twitter and concluded that according to classification experiments over different corpora show that affective information helps in distinguishing among ironic and non-ironic tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>In this section, we describe the details of our proposed model. Our proposed approach aims to predict whether the user is keen to spread irony in form of a stereotype or not. Recently, many researchers focused on examining whether graph convolutional networks (GCNs) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.55,497.87,18.03,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> could handle different NLP tasks, especially text classification. Inspired by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,391.97,511.42,17.84,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> we believed applying GCNs to irony and stereotype detections is well-studied because of dependency information. GCN is a multi-layer neural network generalized from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which directly operates on the graph-structured data and learns representation vectors of nodes based on the properties of their neighborhoods. We hypothesize that the author's word usage plays a kind of fingerprinted feature that may convey a meaning when it is connected to words. Similar connections may connect the ironic spreaders in a graph. So, connection represents the dependency information that allows capturing valuable embeddings to represent irony and stereotype spreaders. Considering this we represent the author's tweets in form of graph embeddings to learn the linguistic behavior of the authors to form graph embeddings as dependency information through nodes (words, authors) and edges (the connection between words). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,154.67,660.46,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref> depicts an overview of our proposed method. First, we combined each author's tweets, then we perform the preprocessing. Next, we construct the graph and fed it into the GCN architecture. In the following, we described each component in detail.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>Since we want to construct the graph and more words (nodes) lead to a higher number of edges, as a result of this we had to use higher RAM for training. To avoid this problem, we performed the following steps:</p><p>• Removing punctuations and special characters.</p><p>• Lower the text.</p><p>• Applying word frequency threshold 𝑓 𝑞 𝑤 (words with less than this frequency will be removed from vocabs). • Removing stopwords.</p><p>• Removing URLs, hashtags, mentions, and reserved words (RT, FAV)</p><p>In the end, the graph was constructed with 𝑓 𝑞 𝑤 = 15 to use preferable RAM in graph construction and learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Graph Convolutional Network</head><p>The graph data structure which consists of vertices and edges can be represented as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,271.58,670.31,52.11,9.57">𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸)</formula><p>Where 𝑉 is the vertices and 𝐸 is the edges. For graph learning, the input should be in form of graph data structure. Inspired by a GCN, TextGCN <ref type="bibr" coords="5,321.32,100.52,18.05,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> we construct an entire corpus-based graph, which uses all the words and authors in the corpus as graph nodes and sets the wordword and word-author edges to preserve the global word co-occurrence and word-authors relations in the graph structure. This representation ables the extract dependency features and the author's overlap and sensitiveness to most informative words. Then, it would be modeled by GCN learning for irony spreaders detection. The construction of the graph and GCN learning architecture is described in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Graph Node Construction</head><p>To construct nodes 𝑉 , we used all the words and authors in the dataset. The number of nodes equals:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,254.05,258.97,85.99,9.57">|𝑉 | = 𝑁 = 𝐴 + 𝑀</formula><p>Where 𝑁 is the number of nodes, 𝐴 is the number of users, and 𝑀 is the number of unique words in the dataset. For initial node representation, we used two types of representations: 1) Sentence-BERT, and 2) one-hot embeddings.</p><p>• Aim of Sentence-BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,217.62,330.87,20.67,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is to obtain embeddings for author and word nodes. In this setting, the Sentence-BERT adds a pooling operation to the output of DistilRoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.47,344.41,19.51,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to derive a fixed-sized sentence embedding by computing the mean of all output vectors.</p><p>In the end, we obtained 𝑁 = 11, 750 nodes, and a node representation matrix with the shape of <ref type="bibr" coords="5,156.62,385.79,16.97,9.57" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,175.41,385.79,19.39,9.57">750,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,196.62,385.79,13.08,9.57">768</ref>]. • In one-hot embedding construction we simply set one-hot feature matrix 𝑋 = 𝐼 as an identity matrix which means every word or author is represented as a one-hot vector.</p><p>The one-hot embedding representation is used for edge construction and edge weight calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Graph Edge Construction</head><p>We build a large and heterogeneous text graph that contains word nodes and document nodes so that global word co-occurrence can be explicitly modeled. We utilize author-word and authorauthor edges in addition to word-word edges. We build edges among nodes based on word occurrence in the author's tweets (author-word edges), word co-occurrence in the whole dataset (word-word edges), and authors word co-occurrences in the whole dataset (author-author edges). We used TFIDF vectors to weight author-words edges. Next, we employ point-wise mutual information (PMI), a popular measure for word associations, to calculate weights between word-word nodes. Also, we have considered the Jaccard similarity score based on TFIDF vectors to calculate weights between author-author edges. Formally, the weight of the edge between node 𝑖 and node 𝑗 is defined as follows: In PMI we have considered a sliding window of 20, where at each window the word cooccurrences will be updated for PMI calculation. Also, for author-author edges, we used a threshold of 0.2 which means Jaccard similarity of higher than this threshold will be considered as edges. In the end, we obtained 12, 935, 016 edges to feed the GCN model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,168.67,96.85,66.13,62.62">𝐴 𝑖,𝑗 = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 𝑃 𝑀</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Graph Learning</head><p>To build a corpus-level GCN-based text classification model, after building the text graph, we feed the graph into a simple one-layer GCN with 100 channels. Next, a ReLU activation function and Dropout with a probability of 0.5 are applied to outputs of one-layer GCN. After that, outputs are fed into a linear layer with an input size of 100 and output size as the labels set. Next, outputs are fed into a softmax classifier. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and an epoch number of 1000 was chosen for the training of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Setups</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,115.16,565.63,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents the statistics of the dataset<ref type="foot" coords="6,277.43,563.88,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> that consists of 600 authors for English with ironic and none ironic labels. For each author at least 200 Tweets were collected. The dataset is balanced, with 300 authors for each class. Dataset has split into training and test sets, following the 70/30 proportion. For modeling, we combined each author's tweets as a single text to feed models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Language Traning Testing Total</head><p>English 420 180 600 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Metrics</head><p>Commonly used performance measures include accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. However, due to the less number of training data, we mainly focused on the 5-fold crossvalidation technique in experimental analysis and model selection phases. In this task, because the data is balanced, accuracy is the main metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Training Setups</head><p>The preprocessing is applied to the text, first. Next, using the train set and cross-validation technique we made hyperparameters tuning. We also experimented with Graph Attention Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" coords="7,173.22,413.02,18.07,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for model selection between GCN and GAN. In the end, both models worked similarly, however, we chose GCN because of less complexity regarding GANs. The evaluation metrics for each model (GAN and GCN) on cross-validation have been reported in the results section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>We experimented using a 5-fold cross-validation methodology to analyze GNNs. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,470.74,512.30,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the experimentally designed GCN and GAN models. In the following, we discussed the main quantitative findings and the quantitative analysis of obtained models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Main Quantitative Findings</head><p>We made experimentation with both GAN and GCN models. According to this experimentation and the results in the table 2, in which the models were trained and evaluated with similar hyperparameters and identical datasets at each fold at the time of 5-fold cross-validation, the main quantitive findings are:</p><p>• A comparison of 5-fold cross-validations shows that there is a minor difference between GCN and GAN models so both models behave similarly.</p><p>• Both models predictions over the test set revealed the 96% of agreements between models on predictions, again it confirms that both models behave similarly in 96% of the time. • In model selection, first, due to the high RAM usage of the GAN model, and second, due to small differences between GAN and GCN (which shows GCN is 0.01 better than GAN), we decided to submit the GCN model as a final model for the task. • In a final submission, we obtained an accuracy of 0.900 over an unseen test set. It again confirms the quality proposed model and word-association importance in capturing dependency information via GNNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Quantitative Analysis</head><p>According to our hypothesis, we believe finding word associations allow us to capture the author's style where the primary intent is to spread stereotypes in the form of irony. The proposed method is capable of using heterogeneous graphs to identify irony and stereotypes.</p><p>In this analysis, we point out the possible reason behind the effectiveness of our approach according to the history of AP task and text-based GCN model advantages in tackling this kind of problem.</p><p>Sensitivity to the amount of the data: Deep learning-based models are data-hungry as a result of this deep learning models don't perform on a low number of data for classifications. In previous AP shared tasks only <ref type="bibr" coords="8,223.25,347.12,17.75,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> was able to be in the top performer team that used ensemble features to feed fully connected neural networks that allowed them to properly identify the fake news spreaders. This year there was a slight increase in the number of samples however still deep learning models require more amount of data. Because of this the limited data leads to low-quality features for models to capture the author's styles unless bringing more features as a result of these high-level feature extractors is crucial to obtain better performance where a similar story has been investigated in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,251.95,428.42,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> where participants used convolutional neural network (CNNs) to extract valuable features for a classifier to detect hate-speech spreaders. As a result of limited data for irony and stereotypes, it is hard to identify the author's styles. However, according to <ref type="bibr" coords="8,147.20,469.07,17.89,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> the Text GCN can achieve higher test accuracy with limited labeled samples. The reason behind this is that similar to CNN models the GCN tries to capture high-level features using word associations in heterogeneous text graphs which allows the classifier to detect the author's styles when they are intended to spread irony and stereotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of the size of authors tweets:</head><p>In classification problems when there are short texts, the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) specially long-short term memory (LSTM) are performing well. However, the challenge rasses when there are long texts. It is difficult to represent them and also a challenge for RNNs to extract sequential information appropriately. Word order matters for tasks such as sentiment analysis so RNN models are the right choice for these tasks. However, in this task, the word co-occurrences together with word semantics are important, because the aim is to capture styles and author intents. Each author may have its word category to use and by capturing these word preferences we may come across preferable word usages for different classes. With GCNs we can employ word co-occurrences and relations between words in form of edge weights in addition to word semantics in form of nodes. So, GCN doesn't care about word orders and it only cares about word usage with semantics and which makes GCNs a good choice for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visualization:</head><p>The figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,212.62,105.00,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_3">2</ref> represents the visualization of the GCN layer for train and test sets using the t-SNE technique. We set the irony labels with red color and not irony with green colors. For the train, we have used the grand truth labels and for the test, we have used the prediction labels. Given author embedding learned by GCN, the t-SNE visualization shows that GCN learns more discriminative author embeddings that are more distinguishable. In the test set, even If we consider a 10 percent of error in prediction the visualization shows a very high-quality split. Generally, the visualizations show that GCN produces linear features for the classifier. The features entered into the linear layer followed by a softmax function, which is formally known as a logistic regression classifier. All together, GCN is capable of extracting linear features which is very well-suited for logistic regression in irony and stereotype spreader identifications.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we propose a GCN that builds a heterogeneous word authors graph for a whole corpus and turn authors classification into a node classification problem. The GCN can capture global word co-occurrence information and utilize limited labeled documents well. A simple single-layer Text GCN demonstrates promising results for Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on the Twitter task in PAN 2022. In the final, we achieved an accuracy of 0.900. Based on our manual evaluation, our approach is very capable of determining irony and stereotype spreaders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="4,89.29,376.33,179.51,8.93;4,224.79,159.93,83.34,192.92"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Architecture of Proposed Method</figDesc><graphic coords="4,224.79,159.93,83.34,192.92" type="bitmap" /></figure>
