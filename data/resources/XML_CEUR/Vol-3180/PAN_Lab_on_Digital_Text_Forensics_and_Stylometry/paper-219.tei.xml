<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Currently, large flows of information are managed on the Internet. Content creation is accompanied by ethical questions regarding determining what is socially accepted. The irony is defined as a clever way of expressing an idea when in fact, another is being expressed. This, when accompanied by stereotyped ideas such as the sexual orientation of others, women's rights, or the LGBTQI+ community, can generate controversy on social networks and in some cases, hate speech <ref type="bibr" coords="1,122.45,405.48,11.36,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,136.54,405.48,7.47,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,146.74,405.48,7.57,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Interesting approaches have been taken along this time by some authors and one of the most known environments this takes place happens at the PAN shared tasks 1 . Fersini et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,148.11,446.13,13.00,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed an approach based on stylometry, personality, emotions, and feed embedding to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Duan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,138.80,486.78,12.69,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> address the binary classification problem to detect Fake News Spreader extracting linguistic and sentiment features from users tweet's feed using the torch.nn 2 library.

The main difference concerning previous tasks is that this year's task proposes to develop systems capable of identifying Twitter profiles that spread irony and stereotypes given the history of tweets of that profile. As usual, the task organizers provide the TIRA platform <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.72,154.71,17.77,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to perform all the heavy computations by the competitor's models. In our work we proposed a tweet profile representation using some techniques of deep learning and lexical analysis, due to the state-of-the-art of this model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,359.59,195.36,16.43,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,378.74,195.36,12.32,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref>. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we described the proposed system to competitions. In Section 3, an experimental description of developed experiments is provided. Finally, in Section 4, we explain the acquired conclusions from the work and we suggest a future investigation line related to this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Our proposal</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Task's specifications</head><p>The task consists in given a Twitter user's feed written in English, composed of 200 tweets sharing Irony and Stereotyping content, and discriminating whether the given user should be labeled as an Irony and Stereotype Spreader (ISS) or not. As competition baselines, PAN22 will use Character/Words n-grams + SVM/Logistic Regression, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model overview</head><p>Given a user timeline, our model builds its representation based on a Semantic Representation (SR), Punctuation Marks Representation (PMR), and an Auxiliary Words Representation (AWR). The first representation aims to distinguish what is spoken in a text document. To do so, we employ a fine-tuned model from sentence-transformers named r2d2/stsb-bertweet-base-v0 which maps sentences and paragraphs to a 768-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search. This model belongs to the Bidirectional Model from Transformers (BERT) models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.03,500.82,16.25,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The second representation looks to capture the author's writing style based on his use of punctuation marks such as emojis, emphasis signs, and special characters. The last representation is intended to represent the writing style relying on author discourse markers use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Model Stages</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Semantic, Punctuation and Auxiliary Words Representations</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,120.36,625.31,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows all the profile representations our model builds. First of all, it is constructed a 10-vectors 768-dimensional vector to build the SR. Each of the 10-vectors holds an accumulated sum obtained by encoding 20 user tweets with r2d2/stsbbertweet-base-v0 sentence-transformers embeddings. All these vectors were intended to acquire the profile lexical and semantic style. Subsequently, it is computed a Punctuation marks term frequency vector which holds the number of occurrences of a given punctuation mark in the author profile. The possible terms this vector could have are precomputed finding the dataset vocabulary punctuation marks. This vector gives the model the capability to quantify the punctuation writing style similarity between different authors and belongs to the PMR in our model. Lastly, an auxiliary word term frequency vector is calculated in the same way the PMR builds its vector. This final vector holds the AWR. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Similarity metric</head><p>In our proposal, we need a measure that quantifies how similar any two profiles are. We fix this measure like the mean of each representation's similarities. The SR similarity is computed by taking the mean from the highest vector embedding pair similarities (𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑣 𝑗 ) such 𝑖 and 𝑗 are not associated, where 𝑖 represents the 𝑖 th dense vector associated to a tweet from a profile 𝐴 and 𝑗 represents the 𝑗 th dense vector associated to a tweet from a profile 𝐵. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,290.16,643.36,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We calculate the vector's similarities using the usual cosine similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,219.89,93.87,286.75,25.50">𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 ) = cos (𝜃) = 𝑣 1 .𝑣 2 ‖𝑣 1 ‖‖𝑣 2 ‖ (1)</formula><p>Being 𝑣 1 and 𝑣 2 vector embeddings associated to two tweets. In the previous graph, the numbers on the lines that connect two tweets represent the greatest cosine similarities between the embeddings of the encodings of the tweets of profile A and the tweets of profile B. The general similarity value of profiles A and B would be the average of these similarities (i.e 0.85). To compute the semantic similarity between pairs of tweets, this same methodology is applied, considering the sentences of those tweets. This approach seeks to avoid the influence in the comparison of documents (paragraphs) with different amounts of sentences and to build the similarity based on the most similar tweets. As the PMR and the AWR calculated the same length vectors for every profile pair, we take advantage of this fact and compute its corresponding similarity with the same cosine similarity shown in Equation 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Core basis of profiling method</head><p>When the model attempts to classify a non-labeled profile into one of the two classes (ISS or non-ISS) we state that it should belong to the class where the accumulated sum of the most similar 𝑘 profiles to the unknown profile is the biggest. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,457.72,572.37,5.03,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for 𝑘 = 1 (i.e the unlabeled profile will belong to the class that contains the most similar profile to it).</p><p>For some 𝑘 &gt; 1 the model computes an accumulate sum on each class. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Parameter fitting</head><p>We fix the most similar 𝑘 profiles, the unlabeled profiles require to make the accumulated sum as our model tunable parameter. Our model's parameter fitting is focused on finding the best k such that the accuracy of predictions increases. We also estimate how are the interactions between representations by testing some representations and dropping the remaining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Dataset Specification</head><p>A training corpus was released to train and validate competitor's models <ref type="foot" coords="5,426.98,466.21,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> . This dataset is composed of 420 English Twitter user profiles timelines composed each one with 200 tweets, along with a ground truth file holding the given profiles classification. A test dataset was released for testing the models as well. The test corpus is composed of 180 Twitter timelines. As organizers state in the competition's description, the whole dataset is balanced (i.e the number of ISS profiles and non-ISS profiles released is the same). The quality metric proposed to evaluate the competitor's results in this task was accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Developed experiments</head><p>First of all, we represent the whole training dataset into the proposed representations: SR, PMR, and AWR. To estimate the best 𝑘 and representation combination we run a 5-fold crossvalidation over the training corpora, testing on each cross all possible 𝑘 and representations permutations. We illustrate in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,249.00,373.40,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> the best k obtained results and the respective accuracy of the model obtained using that parameter. We also considered testing a slightly different approach where instead of having a single representation combination, have three different combinations (the ones with best results), each one emitting a vote to determine the unknown profile predicted class. In this version, an unknown profile belongs to the majority voted class from each of the representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Results analysis</head><p>From the developed experiments we elaborate two possibilities to test models: a single representation one and a majority vote model. We run a 5-fold cross-validation over training to compare the two models. Results are illustrated in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,341.78,517.97,3.74,10.91">2</ref>. In the test set, it was tested the Majority vote approach, getting an accuracy of 0.63, consistent with validation set tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion and future work</head><p>Making a system able to extract author feature as age, gender or political orientation is a challenging and interesting task in the research community. This work shows the results obtained by the UO-UDC team at the Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on Twitter shared task hosted by PAN. We strongly believe that adding some other lexical-semantic representations to our model could improve its accuracy. For future work, we considered adding a word phonetic representation that expresses some irony regarding words likely considering their pronunciation due to the Twitter tweet's informal nature. We also consider it appropriate to evaluate an approach in which each representation contributes in a different and weighted way to the general similarity measure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,507.73,165.77,8.93;3,113.39,202.08,368.51,293.09"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Author profile representations</figDesc><graphic coords="3,113.39,202.08,368.51,293.09" type="bitmap" /></figure>
