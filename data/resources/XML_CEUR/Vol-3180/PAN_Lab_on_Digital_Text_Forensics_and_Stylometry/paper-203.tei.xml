<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This work proposes to solve the problem of profiling irony and stereotype spreaders on twitter using a random forest model with features obtained using chi square feature scoring. The task is to determine whether the author of a given Twitter feed in English spreads irony and stereotypes. The training sample contains timelines of authors sharing irony and stereotypes towards, for instance, women or the LGTB community. Transforming this question into binary classification problem which requires us to classify authors as ironic or not. Evaluation with 300 chi2 features shows an overall performance of ACC = 0.9722.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Irony uses metaphorical and sophisticated language to indicate the polar opposite of what is literally said. The purpose of sarcasm, a more aggressive form of irony, is to mock or humiliate a victim while not ruling out the possibility of harm. Stereotypes are frequently employed, particularly when discussing contentious issues such as immigration or sexism and misogyny.</p><p>Irony and stereotype has the unique virtue of making it difficult to bridge the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Detecting irony and stereotype behavior in online social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, polls, and other places has become a crucial task since it affects social and personal connections. Irony detection is a critical processing challenge in natural language processing (NLP), which is required for better understanding and to serve as an interface for machine-human communication.</p><p>Ironic and stereotyped tweets made in a friendly tone go unnoticed. People can use politeness to be sarcastic, using very formal language that do not fit the casual discourse. Irony is often shown by complimenting someone in a formal manner. Ironic and stereotyped tweets, by their very nature, lead to incorrect replies from review summarization systems, sentiment classifiers, review ranking systems, and any other application that deals with the semantics and pragmatics of text. Nonetheless, most social media and microblogging sites, such as Twitter, set text length limits that arguably do little to prohibit the use of innovative language such as sarcasm and irony, which allow strong views to be expressed effectively <ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.40,249.56,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Irony detection was first explored by Reyes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.56,276.66,12.70,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> [3], he approaches irony as a language phenomena, undistinguished from sarcasm, that incorporates something unexpected or contradictory, using decision trees to classify features indicating unexpectedness such as emotive words, contradictory phrases, and punctuation.</p><p>[4] is an example of automatic humor recognition in which he detected sarcasm in areas including politics, education, and humor. The hashtags #sarcasm, #politics, #education, and #humour were used to collect data from Twitter. He uses the American National Corpus Frequency Data and the morphology of tweets to create a measure of unexpectedness and probable ambiguities based on words that are primarily used in spoken language. Random forests and decision trees are used to classify the data.</p><p>To detect irony, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.38,439.25,12.99,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> employed Logistic Regression and focused on the unexpectedness factor, which is defined as an emotional imbalance between words in a text. While <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.12,452.79,12.99,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> suggested a pattern-based technique for detecting irony that uses n-grams and combinations of adverbs and acronyms that imply comedy as characteristics. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,325.86,479.89,12.95,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduced a new method that treats sarcasm as a binary classification job, pitting positive-negative statements against each other. WordNet-Affect and LWIC are used to extract lexical features, as well as so-called "pragmatic factors, " which indicate user sentiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Corpus</head><p>The training corpus was available in the English to be used to determine determine whether its author spreads irony and stereotypes. The dataset had 210 documents of label NI (contains set of tweets)) and 210 documents of label I (tweets containing some form of irony). In our point of view, the problem is therefore to identify a set of tweets containing irony, leading to consider that the user generates and/or spreads stereotype <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.07,86.97,24.05,10.91">[8][9]</ref>. This task will be performed only English language. As one can see in Tables 2, tweets in Category #I describe questions to a facts " in the fact that it actually physically exists" followed by ironic statements "Assuming it's not photoshopped".</p><p>In tweets appearing under the second label, #NI the statements used in the tweets are facts followed by an explanation to the point noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Feature Selection</head><p>The process of picking a subset of the terms in the training set and using only this subset as features in text classification is known as feature selection. The objective of feature selection is twofold. First, it reduces the quantity of the effective vocabulary, making training and using a classifier more efficient. This is especially important for classifiers that are more expensive to train. Second, by removing noisy features, feature selection frequently improves classification accuracy. A noise feature is one that raises the classification error on new(unseen) data as it is added to the document representation.</p><p>Feature selection can be thought of as a way of substituting a complex classifier (one that uses all features) with a simpler one (using a subset of the features). Tokens are considered according to their document frequency (df) and word frequency difference in the two-stage feature selection technique. This exercise was completed with a three-fold threshold (df &gt; 3) and a one-fold threshold (tf &gt; 1). We design a feature set capable of differentiating each category using these two limitations. A term frequency difference is computed from the reduced number of tokens obtained by applying df &gt; 3, but only tokens with a term frequency greater than 1 (tf &gt; 1) are taken into account, leaving out tokens that appear just once in the text.</p><p>Chi-square (𝜒 2 ) is a function used to test the independence of two variables in the correct case, the independence of a feature and a category is provided by a 𝜒 2 value. The higher value of the 𝜒 2 , the closer relationship the variables have Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measures how much information a term contains about a class. It measures how much information the presence/absence of a term contributes to making the correct classification decision. The magnitude of PMI will indicate if an association between a feature and a category exist or not <ref type="bibr" coords="4,289.39,528.54,17.75,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,309.85,528.54,16.09,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. PMI can therefore be used to decide if a feature is informative or not, and a feature selection is done on that basis. Having less features often improves the performance of your classification algorithm. To calculate 𝑃 𝑀 𝐼, as a ratio the joint probability (𝑝(𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑗 )) and the probability of occurrence of term 𝑡 𝑖 multiplied by the probability of selecting a text belonging to the category 𝑐 𝑗 .</p></div>

Only the top m terms (e.g., m = 300) depicting the highest discriminating powers selected with the chi2 (𝜒 2 ) and PMI feature selection techniques will be used in the model. The model with the best score was the chosen to build the final classifier.</p><p>Splitting the training data into train (300) and development (120), the two step feature selection reduces the features as shown in the Table <ref type="table" coords="5,280.93,168.26,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Random Forest Classifier</head><p>Random Forest consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model prediction <ref type="bibr" coords="5,322.56,371.50,16.41,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This model can perform well given large feature sets because it combines the predictions of various decision trees to build a more robust classifier. While constructing new decision trees, this method uses a random subset of features which gets rid of spurious features and improving the robustness of our estimate.</p><p>The random forest method operates by following the steps below: 1): From the dataset provided, the algorithm selects random samples. 2): For each sample chosen, the algorithm will generate a decision tree. Then, for each decision tree constructed, it will acquire a prediction result. 3): For each expected outcome, voting will be conducted. It will employ mode to solve a classification problem and mean to solve a regression problem. 4): Finally, the algorithm will choose the prediction with the most votes as the final prediction.</p><p>In random forests, hyperparameters are used to either improve the model's performance and predictive capacity or to make it faster. The hyperparameters are listed as follows. 1). n estimators -the number of trees built by the algorithm before averaging the predictions. 2). max features -the number of features that a random forest evaluates while splitting a node. 3.) mini sample leaf -specifies how many leaves are necessary to separate an internal node. 4). n jobs-this parameter tells the engine how many processors it can use. It can only use one processor if the value is 1, but there is no limit if the value is -1. 5). random state-regulates the sample's unpredictability. If the model has a definite value of random state and is given the same hyperparameters and training data, it will always generate the same results. 6). oob score -OOB is an abbreviation for "out of the bag. " It's a cross-validation method based on random forests. In this case, one-third of the sample is used to evaluate the data rather than train it. These samples are drawn from a bag of samples.</p><p>Random forest has been used in a variety of applications, for example <ref type="bibr" coords="6,390.69,363.46,17.75,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> combined data enrichment with the introduction of semantics in random forest to improve short text classification.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation</head><p>To train our model, features are extracted from the training documents by taking into account the steps explained in section 3. Features to be considered must have a tf&gt;1 and df&gt;3 from which the ranking is done according to chi2 and PMI with k feature set of 300.</p><p>The accuracy of several classifiers are computed as shown in the Table <ref type="table" coords="6,400.04,598.23,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. It was easy to analyse the performance of the classifiers where we can see that accuracy of XGB = 0.917 is the highest when all selected features are used. When chi2 was used to rank the features and using the top 300, random forest scored highest accuracy of RF = 0.942. Ranking the features again with PMI and using the top 300, again random forest had the best performance, RF = 0.925.</p><p>The use of RF in the final model with chi2 ranking was based on its overall highest score of 0.942 accuracy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The research proposes a machine learning approach for detecting irony and stereotype spreaders. A random forest classifier was proposed. For the test set on TIRA, the final performance provided us an accuracy of roughly 0.9722. Because the features used in the classification are drawn in similar amounts from both classes, our approach is quite competent of identifying irony/nonirony tweets. The discriminating strength of each feature in the class is measured using a concept called probability difference. These characteristics highlight the distinction between the two classes, which are subsequently ranked based on their chi2 values to enable further reduction in the features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,319.62,382.26,17.91,10.91;4,164.20,414.06,6.83,9.57;4,171.02,411.56,4.23,6.99;4,175.76,414.06,41.27,10.63;4,221.26,404.61,97.51,12.65;4,313.67,406.62,48.82,10.63;4,357.40,404.61,67.75,12.65;4,425.15,404.67,4.23,6.99;4,265.74,419.53,119.65,12.65;4,257.30,445.19,8.49,9.57;4,307.52,437.81,80.12,9.57;4,387.64,435.86,4.23,6.99;4,270.01,452.67,159.88,9.57;4,494.41,428.46,11.57,10.91"><head>[ 10 ]</head><label>10</label><figDesc>𝜒 2 (𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑗 ) = 𝑛 * ((𝑝(𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑗 ) * 𝑝(𝑡 ¯𝑖, 𝑐 ¯𝑗))(𝑝(𝑡 𝑖 , 𝑐 ¯𝑗) * 𝑝(𝑡 ¯𝑖, 𝑐 𝑗 ))) 2 𝑝(𝑡 𝑖 ) * 𝑝(𝑡 ¯𝑖) * 𝑝(𝑐 𝑗 ) * 𝑝(𝑐 ¯𝑗) = 𝑛 * (𝑎 * 𝑑 -𝑐 * 𝑏) 2 (𝑎 + 𝑐) * (𝑏 + 𝑑) * (𝑎 + 𝑏) * (𝑐 + 𝑑) (1)</figDesc></figure>
