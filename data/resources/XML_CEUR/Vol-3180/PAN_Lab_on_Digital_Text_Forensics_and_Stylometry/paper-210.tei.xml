<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes a proposed system design for Style Change Detection (SCD) tasks for PAN at CLEF 2022. We propose a unified architecture of ensemble neural networks to solve three SCD-2022 edition tasks. We fine-tune the BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT transformers and their connecting classifiers to measure the similarity of two given paragraphs or sentences for authorship analysis. Each transformer model is regarded as a standalone method to detect differences in the writing styles of each testing pair. The final output prediction is then combined using the majority voting ensemble mechanism. For SCD-2022 Task 1, which requires finding the only one position of a single style at the paragraph level, our approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.7540. For SCD-2022 Task 2 to detect the actual authors of each written paragraph, our method achieves a macro F1-score of 0.5097, a Diarization error rate of 0.1941 and a Jaccard error rate of 0.3095. For SCD-2022 Task 3 to find located writing style changes at the sentence level, our model achieves a macro F1-score of 0.7156. In summary, our method is the winning approach in the list of all intrinsic approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>PAN hosts a series of shared tasks for digital text forensics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,356.91,443.34,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. PAN-2018 introduced a Style Change Detection (SCD) to differentiate between multiple authors. The goal of the SCD-2022 shared task seeks to identify author switches within multi-author documents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.30,470.44,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Given a document combined from the StackExchange questions and answers, participants are asked to solve three tasks illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="1,269.99,497.54,3.87,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: 1) Style Change Basic: given a text written by two authors that contains a single style change only, the developed system should find the position of such change; 2) Style Change Advanced: the developed system should be able to assign each paragraph of a multi-author text to a particular author; 3) Style Change Real-Word: for a text written by two or more authors, the developed system should find all positions of writing style change at the sentence level. Tasks 1 and 3 are basically similar but at different levels of granularity, i.e. paragraph-level or sentence-level. The output for Task 1 is represented as a list, supporting a binary classification for each pair of consecutive paragraphs within the given document, where '0' means no style change and '1' denotes the only one style change in the task setting. Task 3 has a similar output format, presenting comparisons between each pair of consecutive sentences which may contain multiple changes. Task 2 is relatively difficult because the actual number of authors is unknown (though limited to five). Thus, the first author is identified as '1', the second author appearing in the document is referred to '2', and so on. This paper describes our developed NCUEE-NLP (National Central University, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Natural Language Processing Lab) system for the style change detection task of PAN-2022 evaluation. Our solution explores the use of pre-trained transformer models including BERT, RoBERTa and AlBERT, and fine-tuning of the downstream classification task for writing style change detection. In addition, system performance is enhanced using a majority voting ensemble mechanism. For Task 1, our ensemble solution had a macro F1-score of 0.7540. For Task 2, our system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.5097, a Diarization error rate of 0.1941 and a Jaccard error rate of 0.3095. For Task 3, our model resulted in a macro F1-score of 0.7156.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 investigates related studies for the previous editions of the SCD task. Section 3 describes the NCUEE-NLP system for the SCD-2022 tasks. Section 4 presents results evaluation and performance comparisons. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The 2018 edition of the SCD task focused on detecting whether a document is single-authored or multi-authored using intrinsic analyses <ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.73,595.29,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This task belonged to a binary classification problem, in which the document contained style changes, indicating at least two authors. An ensemble of supervised learning models including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, MLP and LightGBM was proposed to make predictions of style change <ref type="bibr" coords="2,365.44,635.94,11.49,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Parallel attention networks were used to focus on the hierarchical structure of the language and the parse tree features of a sentence for style change detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.54,663.04,11.47,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Three feature types, including text statistics, hashing, and high dimensionality were extracted to independently train the classifiers using an ensemble learning strategy to detect writing style changes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,307.08,100.52,11.42,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Basic stylometry analysis based on word frequencies was used for efficient detection of style change <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.67,114.06,11.56,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The Bidirectional Echo State Network was also applied to detect writing style changes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,346.51,127.61,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The SCD-2019 edition added a subtask for detecting the actual number of authors within a document <ref type="bibr" coords="3,135.35,154.71,11.28,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Two clustering algorithms based on threshold and window merge were proposed to yield a number of clusters corresponding to the number of authors <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.68,168.26,16.23,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. If multiple authors are detected in a document, the K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms are used to group the documents written by the same author <ref type="bibr" coords="3,310.77,195.36,16.25,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The SCD-2020 edition added a subtask to detect style changes between two consecutive paragraphs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,143.46,222.46,16.41,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This past year, a paragraph representation based on character, lexical and syntactic features was proposed, using a clustering algorithm for style change detection <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.23,236.01,16.35,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The BERT pre-trained bidirectional model was used to generate the embedding representation and train a random forest classifier to detect style changes between two paragraphs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,464.13,263.11,16.25,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The SCD-2021 edition also added determining the number of authors and locating specific author changeovers within the text <ref type="bibr" coords="3,247.73,290.20,16.18,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Style change and author identification were regarded as binary classifications based on writing similarity measurements <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.84,303.75,16.30,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A stacking ensemble was developed and trained separately on previous text embeddings and features to enhance style change detection performance <ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.35,330.85,16.41,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The logistic regression classifier was used to determine whether two successive paragraphs were written by the same author or not <ref type="bibr" coords="3,436.08,344.40,16.41,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. An LSTMpowered attribution algorithm was proposed for the style change detection task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,465.43,357.95,16.41,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. An end-to-end Siamese neural network was presented to detect stylistic similarities between two texts to determine the location of authorship changes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.90,385.05,16.25,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, deep learning-based neural computing approaches achieved promising results in the previous editions of the SCD shared task. This motivates us to explore the use of pre-trained transformer models to address the authorship analysis issue for writing style changes. We propose a unified architecture of ensemble neural networks to solve three SCD-2022 tasks. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,119.59,100.52,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows our system architecture for style change detection, comprised of two main parts: 1) pre-trained transformer models; and 2) an ensemble mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Ensemble Pre-trained Transformer Models</head><p>The pre-trained model is a kind of saved neural network that was previously trained on a large-scale data set. Instead of building a model from scratch, pre-trained models can be used to solve similar problems, using transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the pre-trained model to fit the downstream task.</p><p>From the wide range of available pre-trained models, we select the following transformer models to tackle this task:</p><p>• Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,403.17,220.86,17.91,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> BERT uses an encoder architecture with an attention mechanism to construct a transformer-based neural network architecture, providing state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. BERT was pre-trained on two tasks: 1) masked language models: 15% of tokens were masked to train the BERT and the model then predicts the original value of the masked words based on the context; 2) next sentence prediction: BERT was trained to predict whether a following sentence was probable or not based on the previous sentence. Through the pre-training phase, BERT learns contextual embedding for representations from large-scale data sets. After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on smaller data sets to optimize its performance on specific tasks. • a Robust optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,384.50,357.71,17.91,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> RoBERTa is a replication study of BERT pre-training that carefully measures the impact of key parameters and training data size. The model modifications include removing the next sentence predictions, dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data, and training with large batches. • A Light BERT (ALBERT) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,228.94,426.81,17.91,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> ALBERT was proposed to improve the training and results of the BERT architecture, using three different techniques: factorization of the embedding matrix, cross-layer parameter sharing, and inter-sentence coherence prediction.</p><p>Each pre-trained transformer model is regarded as a standalone model. The training datasets are used to fine-tune the language model of the individual pre-trained transformer and its connected Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a classifier. For SCD-2022 Task 1, each pair of two consecutive paragraphs are used for fine-tuning, along with their labeled classes ('1' means change and otherwise '0'). To solve the SCD-2022 tasks under a unified framework, we convert the Task 2 label to the binary classes of style changes <ref type="bibr" coords="4,337.72,560.71,16.41,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The label of the first paragraph (denoting as 𝑃 1 ) is initialized as '1', indicating the first author. The second paragraph (𝑃 2 ) is compared with the 𝑃 1 . If this pair obtains the class label '1' (a style change), reflecting that the author is different from 𝑃 1 (the author label is '2'). Otherwise, if the class label is '0', the author of 𝑃 2 should be the same as that for 𝑃 1 (the author label is '1'). Similarly, every subsequent paragraph is compared against all preceding ones (e.g., P3 is compared with P1 and P2) to produce an ordered author list (limited to at most five distinct authors). For SCD-2022 Task 3, instead of paragraph pairs, we used every sentence pair with their style change labels to train their corresponding transformer models.</p><p>The ensemble mechanism uses multiple learning models to obtain better classification performance. We then use a majority voting ensemble <ref type="bibr" coords="5,328.64,100.52,16.41,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, in which each transformer model makes a independent classification (i.e., a vote 0 or 1) for each testing instance. The final system prediction output is the one that receives a majority of votes.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" coords="5,451.26,207.21,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents a statistical summary of three datasets, which were based on user posts from the StackExchange sites on different topics. A total of 2,000 documents in Dataset 1 were provided for Task 1, while 10,000 documents each from Datasets 2 and 3 were provided for Tasks 2 and 3. Each dataset was mutually exclusive and split into three parts. The training set, including ground truth labels, was used to develop and train the model, and accounted for 70% of the whole dataset. We also used the 11,2000 documents in the 2021 edition dataset of this shared task for training data augmentation. The validation set, accounting for 15% of the whole dataset, was used to evaluate and optimize our model, while the remaining 15% was used for system performance evaluation. </p></div>

On an Nvidia DGX-1 server using a V100 GPU we optimized the hyper-parameter values for our model implementation with the following settings: maximum sequence length 256; learning rate 0.00005; dropout 0.25; epoch 10 and batch size 100 for all three models. System implementation was deployed on the TIRA platform for performance evaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.29,547.89,16.36,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The three tasks were evaluated independently using the macro-averaged F1-score. Two additional measures -the Diarization Error Rate (DER) and Jaccard Error Rate (JER) -were used to provide additional perspectives on the results obtained for Task 2. A higher F1-score and a lower DER and JER indicate more accurate detection performance.</p></div>
