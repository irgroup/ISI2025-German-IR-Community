<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nowadays, a huge amount of information and news articles are available every day. The events of recent years have shown that Fake News can severely shake trust in politics and science. Unfortunately, a decision can only be made about the truthfulness of a fraction of all news and posts. In this respect, the CLEF2022-CheckThat! shared task 3a adresses this problem. In this paper, we propose a new classification approach using a novel metaheuristic feature selection algorithm that mimics human behavior. The results show that the performance of a baseline classifier can achieve higher performance by combining with this algorithm with only a fraction of the features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In times of constant availability of vast amounts of information, people have to judge the truth of news in a short time. This assessment is often neglected due to the fast-moving nature of the news. There are various reasons why authors, whether intentionally or unintentionally, contribute to the generation of untrustworthy content. In particular, sources that deliberately disseminate false information pose a danger to consumers of news.</p><p>Effective methods for detecting fake news are essential in the fight against the targeted spread of fake news. Continuous research and development of approaches to detect misinformation are highly important. This is one mission of the CLEF2022 -CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,431.37,463.47,11.34,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.45,463.47,7.56,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In general, the Lab's goal is to verify the veracity of claims. Task 3a takes up the challenge of assessing the truth content of news articles <ref type="bibr" coords="1,223.43,490.57,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>This paper presents a novel approach for text classification. The concept is based on human behaviour-based optimization (HBBO) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,267.66,517.66,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This meta heuristic optimization approach uses some fundamental interactions and behaviours of humans. The potential of this adaptation was used for the fake news detection in task 3a.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents related works, section 3 describes the human behaviour-based optimization, section 4 summarizes the adaption of the optimization approach for text classification, section 5 presents the given data and the conducted experiments, in section 6 the results are discussed and finally in section 7 a conclusion is given.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The assessment of the truthfulness of news or claims is a special case of text classification whose importance has increased greatly in recent times. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic situation a larger group of people was challenged to judge news correctly. This situation makes the invention of automatic text classification systems necessary <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.79,151.93,11.28,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. To pool a lot of competence and to push the development forward, a task for different participants can be done like the annual task CheckThat! Lab since 2018. The results of last year are summarized in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.88,179.03,11.49,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. These tasks need a high quality dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.34,192.57,11.43,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which is also reflected in the available labels <ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.52,192.57,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>To improve the results for fake news detection and the related text classification task, a wide range of possible approaches can be explored. In this paper, the research focus was on a new technique to select the best features for training. To solve these optimization tasks, nature inspired meta-heuristic techniques can be applied. An overview of already known approaches is given in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,140.09,260.32,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For example, the ant colony optimization is a possible algorithm for feature selection in text classification tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.39,273.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The nature-inspired algorithm used in this paper is derived from human behaviour. The basis of this approach was presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.36,300.97,11.39,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This algorithm was used already in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,418.29,300.97,17.88,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> in combination with self-organizing maps in context of cryptanalytic resistance. The authors compare this approach with other meta-heuristic solutions like ant colony optimization. Next to the approach of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,100.63,341.62,11.28,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, other algorithms based on human behaviour were described. Firstly, in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.47,341.62,17.76,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> the goal is to solve optimization tasks by simulating the phases of knowledge gaining and sharing in younger and older years of human life. A different aspect of optimization algorithms under usage of human behaviour is presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.71,382.26,16.42,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This approach focuses on the adaption of behaviours and manners of other humans for example in family structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Human Behaviour-Based Optimization (HBBO)</head><p>In this section, we briefly describe Ahmadi's novel swarm intelligence-based optimization approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,135.06,467.99,13.00,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> considering human behavior, which forms the basis for the feature selection approach used here. A central aspect in all phases of the algorithm is an individual's pursuit of self-optimization at different stages of his or her life. At the same time, different individuals have different levels of experience in their field, and some of them become experts in one of them (e.g., art, music, or science, etc.).</p><p>The optimization of individual performance is carried out iteratively in four main steps: Initialization, Education, Consultation, and Field Changing. In the Initialization step the population is built. Each individual in the population is assigned an area of interest in which improvement should be achieved. Depending on the underlying optimization problem, an individual is represented as a vector of characteristic variables (features). 𝐼 = (︀ 𝑥 1 𝑥 2 . . . 𝑥 𝑁 )︀ 𝑇 . An expert is determined for each field. The expert provides the best function value depending on his individual feature set. The formal definition of an expert is shown in equation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.30,618.84,10.47,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, where 𝐼 denotes a person, 𝐸 denotes an expert, and 𝐹 denotes the actual field of expertise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,221.47,654.60,285.17,13.21">𝐼 (𝐹 ) → 𝐸 (𝐹 ) = argmin 𝑓 error (𝐹 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The first step in the improvement process, is Education. Individuals in each area learn from the respective expert. The learning process comprises the improvement of the individual characteristic values by those of the expert and aims at the reduction of their own error function value.</p><p>A similar procedure is used in Consultation. In this stage, individuals can learn from any other individual, not only from an expert. For this purpose, some variables are merged between two randomly selected individuals. The consultation is called effective and the merged set of variables is kept if the updated variables lead to better function values. Otherwise, the update is reversed.</p><p>The last step is Field Changing. Whether an individual changes his field of interest is calculated using a rank probability method and the roulette wheel selection.</p><p>After Initialization, the three remaining steps are repeated until a stop criterion is met, e.g. if the average function values do not change (or change too little) or the number of iterations reaches a maximum.</p><p>This algorithm can be adapted to find an optimal feature set for text classification. The next section explains the adaptation in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Adaptation for Text Classification</head><p>In order to adapt the HBBO approach for feature selection, the optimization objective, i.e., an objective function, must be determined. Here, the 𝐹 1 -score is chosen on a test set. For this purpose, the preprocessed dataset must be divided into training and test data. To obtain reliable results and avoid overfitting, the data set is split in terms of k-fold cross-validation. Each fold results in an optimal feature set in the form of a document term matrix (DTM) that is able to classify the respective test data with the greatest possible success. Finally, the results of all the folds are merged into a DTM that contains only the most successful features to classify the entire dataset. For assessing the performance after each optimization step, a support vector machine (SVM) is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Initialization</head><p>During Initialization, each input document is considered as an single individual and encoded in the form of a bit vector. This vector represents an individual's knowledge. Each individual is assigned the class of the respective document, which also represents the field of interest. All vectorized documents together form the entire population. In contrast to the original algorithm where each individual is optimized, here subsets of individuals are optimized together. This leads to a smaller set of documents achieving good or even better classification results than the original set of all documents. A group of individuals contains all fields, which leads to a simultaneous optimization of all classes within a group.</p><p>For this purpose, the individuals are grouped into subsets, with each subset equally populated with individuals of each class (stratified approach). Each group of individuals is optimized separately. The size of the subsets is a hyperparameter.</p><p>The remaining three steps are applied iteratively to each group of each fold. The number of iterations needs to be specified as a hyperparameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Education</head><p>In the Education step, a group of individuals must first be determined for each field that achieves the lowest error with respect to the objective function on the test set according to equation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,493.71,121.08,10.46,10.91" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Each of these groups is considered to be the expert group for that particular field.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,236.57,153.82,270.07,13.13">𝐼 (𝐹 ) → 𝐸 (𝐹 ) = argmax 𝐹 1<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Subsequently, a subset 𝑆 𝐸 of features of the expert group, considering all classes, is merged with the features of other individuals, belonging to the remaining groups. This procedure corresponds to the non-experts approaching the expert group by updating their feature vector.</p><p>The number of terms transferred in this step is another hyperparameter, as well as the number of adapted individuals, i.e., documents. Equation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,312.24,230.73,11.57,10.91" target="#b2">(3)</ref> shows the formal definition of this step, where 𝐼</p><p>(𝐹 ) 𝑖 denotes the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ individual 𝐼 in the specific field 𝐹 and 𝑆 𝐸 ⊆ 𝐸 (𝐹 ) .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,171.55,268.99,335.09,32.89">𝐼 (𝐹 ) 𝑖 = {︃ 𝐼 (𝐹 ) 𝑖 ∪ 𝑆 𝐸 , if𝑓 error (𝐼 (𝐹 ) 𝑖 ∪ 𝑆 𝐸 ) &lt; 𝑓 error (𝐼 (𝐹 ) 𝑖 ) 𝐼 (𝐹 ) 𝑖 , otherwise<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The feature update is considered successful and the merged feature set is retained only if the individual achieves an improvement with respect to the objective function, i.e., better classification results. Otherwise, the previous feature set remains unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Consultation</head><p>In Consultation, the basic procedure is very similar to that in the Education step. The main difference is in the group of individuals from which the features for merging are taken. Regardless of expert status, features are merged between two randomly selected groups of individuals. This leads to greater heterogeneity of terms across all groups. Equation (4) shows the formal definition of Consultation, where 𝑆 𝑗 is a subset of all features of individual 𝐼 𝑗 and 𝑆 𝑗 ⊆ 𝐼 </p><p>As in Education, the updated feature set is retained only if the 𝐹 1 -score improves; otherwise, the previous terms remain unchanged. Again, the number of terms exchanged and the number of individuals paired can be controlled using hyperparameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Field changing</head><p>The last step -Field Changing -does not manipulate the individuals' terms, but changes the field associated with them. The number of randomly selected individuals changing the field is another hyperparameter.</p><p>In a multilevel classification, an individual can simply change their area of interest to that of the most successful expert group. For this purpose, all expert groups are ordered by their 𝐹 1 -score, as shown in equation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,230.67,644.46,10.48,10.91" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, where 𝐸 (𝐹𝑥) is the expert group in the respective area.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,155.33,663.61,351.31,15.27">𝑅 = {︁ 𝐸 (𝐹 1 ) , ..., 𝐸 (𝐹𝑛) | 𝑓 error (︁ 𝐸 (𝐹 1 ) &lt; 𝐸 (𝐹 2 ) &lt; ... &lt; 𝐸 (𝐹𝑛) )︁}︁<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Afterwards, the expert group with the highest rank in 𝑅 determines the field of the individual willing to switch, as shown in equation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,266.61,100.52,10.48,10.91" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,179.73,119.89,326.91,17.17">𝐹 * 𝑥 = {︁ 𝐹 𝑥 |𝐸 (𝐹𝑥) = argmin 𝐸 (𝐹𝑥) ∈𝑅 𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 (︁ 𝐸 (𝐹𝑥) )︁}︁<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In the special case of a binary classification, the process simply reduces to a field change, i.e., an inversion of the class label. Again, the new field is retained only if it leads to an improvement in the objective function value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments and Results</head><p>In this work, the adaptation of HBBO, as discussed in section 4, was applied to the problem of detecting fake news in the context of the CLEF2022-CheckThat! shared task 3a. The documents provided were news articles in English, which were to be grouped into the classes true, false, partially false and other with regard to potentially containing fake news. For training the model, the provided training and development sets were combined so that the total training corpus comprised 1, 264 documents, each of which was assigned to exactly one of the four mentioned classes. The resulting class distribution of the training corpus is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,450.52,314.12,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Before the HBBO algorithm can be applied, the input data must be cleaned. To this end, a wide range of cleaning steps were performed:</p><p>• Combination of article and headline into one pseudo document, • Replacement of newlines and tabs with white space, • Removal of emojis and links, • Removal of special characters, punctuation and numbers, • Removal of stop words, • Lemmatization.</p><p>For simplicity, a bit vector was chosen to represent each single document. Subsequently, the cleaned dataset was divided into samples in terms of 5-fold cross-validation before HBBO could be applied to each sample, resulting in an optimized feature set for each fold.</p><p>In order to observe the specific behavior of the new algorithm, the problem is considered as several binary classification tasks. In this respect, for each class, a model is trained using the training data without applying any kind of balancing technique. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,425.69,114.06,5.14,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> show the values chosen for the experiments. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,130.87,339.39,5.00,10.91" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the history of the 𝐹 1 -score for all 125 iterations for the category true. Shown in green color is the best group of individuals in each iteration, while black dots show the mean of 𝐹 1 -score of all groups and the red horizontal line symbolizes the baseline 𝐹 1 -score trained without HBBO feature selection. The results of the remaining classes are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,499.56,380.04,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,120.36,393.59,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,180.77,393.59,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_5">5</ref> accordingly.</p><p>In order to provide a quantitative overview, the respective results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,500.31,407.14,3.68,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In addition, the mean value is calculated for each class. The system yields a 𝑚𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝐹 1 = 0.602 over all classes. As mentioned earlier, the results of all folds must be merged to combine them into one classifier. This can be achieved simply by concatenating the best group of individuals in each fold. The final feature matrix contains 120 pseudo documents (5 groups of 24 features each).</p><p>In order to uniquely assign each document of the test data to a class, each separately optimized binary model was used for classification in the order of their performance. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,445.91,642.48,5.01,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> summarizes the results of this final classification procedure. Here, 𝑚𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝐹 1 = 0.251 with an accuracy of 0.462. With this result we have reached the 18 𝑡ℎ place of the shared task 3a.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>The results shown are surprisingly low. Nevertheless, HBBO as a feature selection algorithm has a high potential for classification tasks. However, there are still some problems and open research questions. First of all, the drop of 𝑚𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑜 𝐹 1 from training (0.602) and test (0.251) data, which might indicate a slight overfitting. The optimization of each sample takes into account the respective test set. This process may lead to good classification results only within that particular test set. Further studies need to be performed to test this hypothesis. Further performance gains could be achieved by structured experimentation with the hyperparameters or by using more advanced features, such as TF-IDF or BM25. Inseparable from the chaining of binary classifiers is the question of their best order. Among other strategies, the shift to true multi-label classification could also be beneficial. For this, further adaptations of the HBBO algorithm have to be made.</p><p>In addition, the strict requirement for improvement at each optimization step can lead to miss optimal feature combinations. This could be remedied by allowing temporary deteriorations.</p><p>In general, the task of automatically carrying out a fine-grained classification of a document with regard to its truthfulness is difficult to imagine. Inseparable from the spread of fake news is the task of making it appear as real as possible. Thus, there can be no statistically detectable linguistic features that clearly indicate the truthfulness of a document, as can be easily demonstrated analytically. Ultimately, this can only be determined by a fact check. This insight is also underlined by the overall results achieved by all participants in this shared task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper a novel feature selection algorithm for text classification using an human behaviorbased optimization approach is presented in order to solve task of fine-grained fake news detection. The algorithm shows an improved performance compared to classification using a single SVM. In addition, the enormous reduction in training input after optimization is remarkable. In each sample, only 24 optimized pseudo-documents were able to outperform the baseline calculated considering all documents.</p><p>Nevertheless, further experiments must be carried out to find the best values for the hyperparameters. Further improvements might achieved by using a more advanced term representation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,487.17,436.33,13.12,6.99;4,486.32,445.34,3.42,6.99;4,500.79,439.34,2.40,10.91;4,174.32,473.95,4.80,9.57;4,179.97,470.21,13.12,6.99;4,179.11,479.21,2.88,6.99;4,196.62,473.95,8.49,9.57;4,208.14,462.31,8.79,6.98;4,216.92,466.34,4.80,9.57;4,222.57,462.60,13.12,6.99;4,221.72,471.61,2.88,6.99;4,238.62,465.61,46.39,11.36;4,286.18,463.86,16.41,7.97;4,303.09,466.34,9.04,9.57;4,312.98,462.60,13.12,6.99;4,312.13,471.61,2.88,6.99;4,329.03,466.34,44.90,10.63;4,375.10,463.86,16.41,7.97;4,392.01,466.34,9.04,9.57;4,401.90,462.60,13.12,6.99;4,401.04,471.61,2.88,6.99;4,415.52,466.34,4.24,9.57;4,216.92,482.95,4.80,9.57;4,222.57,479.21,13.12,6.99;4,221.72,488.21,2.88,6.99;4,236.19,482.95,3.03,9.57;4,273.33,482.22,44.15,10.91"><head>∪</head><label></label><figDesc>𝑆 𝑗 , if𝑓 error (𝐼(𝐹 ) 𝑖 ∪ 𝑆 𝑗 ) &lt; 𝑓 error (𝐼</figDesc></figure>
