<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The internet and digital platforms have gradually risen as leading sources of news and event information. Studies in literature have revealed various aspects that influence the popularity of social media and digital platforms for news consumption. Compared to conventional newspapers and media, news consumption via social media and online portals is significantly less expensive and early accessible. Although social media and digital platforms provide the easy accessibility of the latest updates to the news consumer, the continuous spread of misinformation such as fake news, clickbait, propaganda, satire or parody and rumors pose a critical threat to the society <ref type="bibr" coords="1,124.15,462.57,13.00,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="1,139.99,462.57,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Fake news 1 is described as a fabricated storyline on a broad scale to deceive readers. According to media scholars <ref type="bibr" coords="1,266.98,476.12,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, fake news is defined as distorted and deceptive content in circulation as news via communication mediums such as print, electronic, and digital communication.</p><p>The first study on fake news detection can be traced back to the year 2014 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,432.52,516.77,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Towards the goal to detect fake news in news articles, the first fake news challenge (FNC-1) 2 was organized by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,102.89,543.87,12.76,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to counter spread of misinformation in form of news article. Several methods have been proposed in the literature for detection of fake news article. This study presents our approach to fake news detection for the shared task at checkThat! for English language dataset. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview on related work, further section 3 gives the details of shared task and section 4 introduces our proposed model. Section 5 discusses the details about various parameters and hyperparameters used to produce the experimental result. Finally, sections 6 and 7 present the result's analysis of the model and conclusion, respectively.</p></div>

In this study, we retrospect works related to fake news article detection only. Studies related to fake news article detection can be categorized into three groups: feature-based approach, similarity-based approach and summarization-based approach. Initial studies on fake news article detection utilized bag-of-words-based features for training ensemble models or multi-layer perceptrons. First fake news contest (FNC-1)<ref type="foot" coords="2,233.50,265.78,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> was organized by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.83,267.54,11.59,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The winning system <ref type="foot" coords="2,436.99,265.78,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">4</ref> of Fake News Challenge combined convolutional neural network (CNN) trained over word embeddings of headline and body with Xgboost model trained with bag-of-words based features. Their Xgboost model was trained over count, TF-IDF, SVD, sentiment and word2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="2,395.12,308.18,17.76,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> features. The second winner, system Team Athene <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.06,321.73,18.02,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> trained multi-layer perceptron on bag-of-words based and domain-dependent features. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="2,245.16,335.28,17.90,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> forms a concatenated feature vector by combining the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vector of headline and body along with cosine similarity between TF-IDF vector of headline and body. These concatenated features are then used to train a multi-layer perceptron to classify the relationship between the headline and body of a news article. Considering the performance of bag-of-words features-based models in studies <ref type="foot" coords="2,120.92,401.27,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">5</ref> , <ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.99,403.03,18.05,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.76,403.03,18.04,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> it is evident that bag-of-words based features which include SVD, TF-IDF, count of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams overlap between headline and body features help in fake news article classification. This is not surprising, as bag-of-words feature help capture the similarity between headline and body. However, the feature-based approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.06,443.67,17.75,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> fails to consider sequential and contextual information in the headline and body of news articles. The study <ref type="bibr" coords="2,488.22,457.22,17.76,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> also suggests that feature-based methods depend upon lexical overlap between headline and body pair. In some cases, though, the headline and body are similar, still the feature-based approach classifies them as unrelated if the body contains a synonym of tokens in the headline rather than tokens. Considering the significance of contextual and sequential information, studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.30,524.97,17.76,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> [19] combine bag-of-words-based features with the sequential encoding of headline and body with LSTM <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.02,538.52,17.75,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and GRU <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.62,538.52,20.39,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A news article has a hierarchical structure, where it is defined by a headline and a body. Further, the body is defined by a sequence of paragraphs, and a sequence of sentences define a paragraph. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="2,301.08,565.62,17.75,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> explores discourse-level structure between document sentences for fake news detections. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.16,579.17,18.07,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> exploits the hierarchical structure of news article body for incongruent news classifications. The study <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.96,592.72,18.07,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> only considers the hierarchical structure of news articles up to paragraph level. However, the hierarchical structure of news articles can be defined up to the word level. Exploiting the hierarchical structure of news articles from the body level to word level could help in capturing long-term dependencies between words of a sentence <ref type="bibr" coords="3,222.71,100.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and dependencies between sentences of paragraphs. Here, dependency between words implies that two words may be far away in sentences, but they may be close contextually <ref type="bibr" coords="3,206.08,127.61,16.16,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Several state-of-the-art document encoders are available in the literature for encoding a sentence by considering long-term dependencies between words, such as tree transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.88,154.71,17.76,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> multiplicative LSTM <ref type="bibr" coords="3,286.61,154.71,16.83,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="3,303.44,154.71,16.83,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. With the objective to exploit hierarchical structure upto word level for capturing long-term dependencies between words of sentences, we use pretrained BERT<ref type="foot" coords="3,196.68,180.06,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,200.88,181.81,16.25,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Recent studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,168.55,195.36,18.07,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> [30] applied the summarization technique over a news article body to generate a synthetic headline from it, which represents and summarizes the body. Subsequently, text matching is applied between the generated headline and the actual headline to detect the incongruent headline. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,219.29,236.01,17.97,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> applied summarization technique which ranks sentences in sentence graph based on the ability of sentences to represent the core concept of the document. The encoding of each sentence in the sentence graph is updated based on its similarity with neighbors. Then, the weighted summation of sentence encoding is passed to a multilayer perceptron for fake news detection. However, synthetically generated headlines from news article body may not be a faithful or good representation of news article body <ref type="bibr" coords="3,424.22,303.75,16.08,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.50,303.75,16.09,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Suppose the article is partially congruent, with most of the sentences in the body being congruent with the headline except for a few. In that case, a summary of the news article body is dominated by the congruent part of the news article body. Hence, the summarization-based approach fails to detect partially incongruent news articles.</p><p>Other sorts of false news, such as partially false news items, are still being circulated on social media. To prevent the spread of such false information, study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,406.17,385.05,18.07,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref> categorized news article in four categories, fake, true, partially false and other class. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,407.32,398.60,17.76,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref> created fake news dataset which depicts the genuine characteristics of false news articles that are circulated on social media platforms. Studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.20,425.70,18.07,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref> [37] present the patterns captured in cross-domain and multilingual fake news detection. The study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,296.23,439.25,18.07,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref> proposed the first multilingual and crossdomain open-source dataset for misinformation detection during the pandemic time. Study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,466.34,17.76,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref> also released large scale multilingual and cross-domain dataset for fake news detection and fact check. Studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,175.13,479.89,17.95,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed a framework to collect and annotate the data. It collects the labelled data from different social media platform in various formats such as image, video or text and annotates the data by a semi-automatic approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task Description</head><p>CheckThat! contest was organized by Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum CLEF2022 to verify the authenticity of news articles. The main objective of shared task 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.51,579.17,17.94,10.91" target="#b37">[38]</ref> was given a pair of text ℬ and the title ℋ, classify the title and text in one of the following categories: true, false, partially false, or other. If a claim made in a news story is valid, it is said to be true. Similarly, a news article is false if the main claim of the news article is false. When part of the news article is genuine, and part of the news article is false, then it is classified as partially false.</p><p>If a news item does not fit into any category, true, false or partially false, it is placed in other class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Proposed system</head><p>Inspired by the study <ref type="bibr" coords="4,189.90,158.99,16.41,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, we extend the hierarchical structure of news articles from news article body to word level to capture long-term dependencies between words of sentences. Although, several state-of-the-art document encoders are available in literature such as tree transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,143.32,199.64,16.09,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, multiplicative LSTM <ref type="bibr" coords="4,255.83,199.64,17.76,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="4,273.59,199.64,17.76,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for encoding a sentence by considering long-term dependencies between words, we considered pretrained BERT<ref type="foot" coords="4,363.93,211.43,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">7</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,368.13,213.18,17.86,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for sentence encoding. We did not fine-tune BERT, keeping in mind the limited size of the available training dataset. Ideally, we could have encoded the entire body of the news article using BERT instead of encoding a sentence, but pre-trained BERT does not consider more than 512 tokens <ref type="bibr" coords="4,402.86,253.83,16.09,10.91" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Motivated by such limitations, we proposed Recurrent over BERT (RoBERT) based models. RoBERT captures two significant properties of news article (i) Encoding of a sentence using pre-trained BERT, which captures long-term dependencies between words because of multi-head attention between words in the encoder component of BERT (ii) News article body is a sequence of sentences. We split the news article body into several sentences and applied pre-trained BERT to obtain the encoding of the sentences. Every sentence in the body is related to the previous and next sentences in the news article. Hence, BiLSTM is applied over the encoding of sentences to encode news article body from left to right where every sentence is conditioned over the previous sentence and right to left encoding where every sentence is conditioned over the encoding of the next sentence. Finally, left to right and right to left encoding are concatenated to form the encoding of the news article body.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,132.04,416.42,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the block diagram of our proposed system. Given news articles 𝒩 with text ℬ and title ℋ pair. We split text ℬ into a set of m sentences. We first obtained encoded representation s 𝑖 of 𝑖 𝑡ℎ sentence in ℬ using pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)<ref type="foot" coords="4,215.42,455.32,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,223.04,457.07,16.41,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Similarly, we also obtained encoded representation h of title ℋ. Then we apply Bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,424.05,470.62,18.06,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> over encoded representation of sentences to obtain the encoded representation b of text ℬ. Our system also utilized bag-of-word based features. Utilizing the various features which include overlap features, SVD similarity between text and title, and TF-IDF similarity. As discussed in sections 2 bag-of-words based feature help to capture similarity in terms of lexical overlap. The study <ref type="bibr" coords="4,488.22,524.82,17.76,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> suggests that BoW-based features positively impact the fake news detection task. The detail of bag-of-word based features are as follows:</p><p>• Overlap features: This feature counts several overlaps: unigrams, bigrams and trigrams between text and title. To extract the count overlap feature, first, we extract unigrams, bigrams and trigrams for both text ℬ and title ℋ. After that, we counted how many unigrams, bigrams, trigrams of title ℋ are present in unigrams, bigrams, trigrams of text ℬ. These features essentially count the common unigrams, bigrams and trigrams between title ℋ and text ℬ. • Singular value decomposition similarity between text and title:Singular value decomposition (SVD) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,215.64,490.05,18.06,10.91" target="#b39">[40]</ref> features help obtain the latent topics involved in the corpus and represent text and title as a mixture of these topics. To obtain SVD of title ℋ and text ℬ first, we construct title to words matrix and text to words matrix, where an entry in title to words and text to words matrix are TF-IDF of each word. SVD is then applied over both texts to word and title to word matrix. We retrained the top 50 dimensions from both matrices in their decomposition. To obtain similarity between text and title, we apply cosine similarity between SVD of headline and SVD of body. • Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) similarity: First TF-IDF feature vectors for title and text are obtained by calculating the Term-Frequency of each unigram, normalized by its Inverse-Document Frequency. Then we calculate the cosine similarity between these title and text TF-IDF vectors.</p><p>Given encoded representation b and h of text ℬ and title ℋ respectively. We further obtained the following feature.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,277.52,100.52,228.47,43.55">r=b ⊙ h (1) d=b -h<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Now, we define the final feature for the classification as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,248.94,174.90,257.05,10.91">p=b ⊕ h ⊕ r ⊕ d ⊕ f<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ⊕ denotes concatenation and f is bag-of-words based features. Finally, the estimated feature vector p is passed through a fully connected neural network followed by Softmax. Our system used cross entropy as loss function to learn the parameters. Our experimental setup was based on 100 LSTM hidden units, two layers fully connected neural network and 500 training epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Setup</head><p>This study uses cross-entropy as a loss function with a learning rate of 0.01 to learn the parameters. We consider a maximum of 32 sentences in the text of a news article. If the number of sentences in the text is less than 32, then we pad the random vector, and if there are more than 32 sentences, we consider only the first 32 sentences. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,379.83,350.73,5.06,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the value of other hyperparameters used for experiment.

Accuracy and F1 score of our proposed system submitted to checkThat! task 3 is 0.377 and 0.234, respectively. However, we recreated the experiment with a labeled test dataset released by the organizer checkThat! of task 3 and observed accuracy of 0.442 and an average F1 score of 0.296. For the submission to 'checkThat! Lab Task 3', we have considered the batch parameter as a size of 8 samples. The new results are with a batch size of 4. Hence, there is a slight difference between results. Though, our system performed average compared to other systems submitted to checkThat!, fine-tuning BERT can significantly improve the performance of our proposed method with the large-scale dataset. In future work, we will investigate the performance of our proposed system over the publicly available large-scale dataset.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,89.29,378.90,252.70,9.65;5,341.99,377.32,7.67,6.12;5,352.66,379.17,153.33,8.87;5,89.29,390.82,416.69,9.68;5,89.29,402.78,417.78,9.17;5,89.29,414.73,417.79,9.17;5,89.29,426.69,416.70,9.17;5,89.29,438.94,237.75,8.87;5,127.56,84.19,340.15,286.08"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Block diagram of the proposed system.
