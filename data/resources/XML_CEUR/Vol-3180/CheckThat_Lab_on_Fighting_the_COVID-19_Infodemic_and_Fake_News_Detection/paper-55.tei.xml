<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>With the advent and uprise of social media, fake news, disinformation and the spread of propaganda have become some of the most pressing issues of the time. Although the spread of disinformation is not a new phenomenon, it has accelerated with time as people around the world have become more connected than ever, primarily through social media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,425.07,475.02,13.84,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The spread of disinformation is an issue that affects almost all spheres of society and hence, several strategies for combating disinformation and its effects are currently being researched and implemented. However, they haven't proven to be sufficiently effective. Although no strategy can be perfect, the persisting prevalence of disinformation and fake news on social media indicates that there is still progress to be made in improving these strategies.</p><p>The CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,196.04,556.32,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) was run for the fifth time in 2022 and aimed to foster technology that would help in identifying and dealing with disinformation present in tweets. Particularly, the tasks aim to evaluate the check-worthiness, presence of verifiable claims, presence of content harmful to the society in the tweets, and further evaluate the amount of attention a tweet should get from the policymakers.</p><p>We participated in Task 1 of The CheckThat! Lab 2022 and completed 3 subtasks (1A, 1B, and 1C). We used a Multimodal model that uses BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.96,127.61,12.83,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for the textual data and further also includes categorical and numerical features for prediction. For the numerical and categorical features, we used certain data points relevant to a particular tweet(such as the credibility of the account, the links, and so on) extracted from the Twitter API to supplement the available knowledge. Finally, to expand our database and have an overall better trained model, we used data augmentation to increase the size of our dataset. This was performed by translating the Dutch and Bulgarian training sets. This translation was performed only in languages with similar scripts and semantics to ensure the preservation of information within the tweet.</p><p>Our team ranked #2 on subtasks 1B and 1C, and #9 on subtask 1A. In this paper, we shall describe our methodology in detail. The key advantages of our system were that it had a bigger dataset due to augmentation and the fact that we used not only textual but also categorical and numerical features to train our model.</p><p>Our code has been released and is publicly available.<ref type="foot" coords="2,333.93,288.45,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task Description</head><p>This year, the CheckThat! <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.77,348.83,15.26,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Lab campaign has a total of 3 tasks, each further divided into multiple subtasks. Our team participated in Task 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.70,362.38,11.58,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, specifically in 3 subtasks in Task 1, namely 1A, 1B and 1C. Task 1 dealt with identifying relevant claims in tweets. Subtask 1A: Subtask 1A aims to evaluate the check-worthiness of tweets. The goal of this task is to predict whether a given tweet is worth fact-checking. The task is offered in 6 languages, and our team provided a submission for the English test set.</p><p>Subtask 1B: Subtask 1B deals with detecting the presence of a verifiable claim in a given tweet. Given a tweet, this task requires us to predict whether it contains a verifiable factual claim. The task is offered in 5 languages, and our team submitted the English test set.</p><p>Subtask 1C: Subtask 1C deals with the evaluation of a tweet in terms of its effects on the consumers. Specifically, it aims to determine whether it harms the society. The task runs in 5 languages, and our team has provided a submission for the English test set during the evaluation phase.</p><p>All the three subtasks 1A, 1B, and 1C are binary classification tasks, with two labels: 0, 1 which represent a "No" and "Yes" response to the given specifics of the subtask. The datasets provided for all the three subtasks contain tweets in Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, English, and Turkish. Additionally, Spanish data is present for subtask 1A.</p><p>The metric used to evaluate the subtasks 1A and 1C is the F1 score, which is simply the harmonic mean of precision and recall and hence increases with improvement in both, precision and recall.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,233.31,628.46,272.67,25.77">𝐹 1 = 2 × Precision × Recall Precision + Recall (1)</formula><p>For subtask 1B, accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.</p></div>

Our analysis included visualizing the given data, which meant building word clouds of the most frequently used words, in which the biggest (the most frequently used) words are related to COVID-19. Subsequently, the frequency barplot displays the most frequently used words found after tokenizing the data, confirming our assumption. Upon further analysis, an imbalance in the label count was also observed (as seen in the label count frequency barplot).</p><p>The descriptions of the respective datasets, along with relevant visualizations are present below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">System Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>The text data present in the dataset needs to be processed in a manner that eliminates the non-useful components and presents the text in a way in which our model can give meaningful  results. Preprocessing the textual dataset involved the following steps:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Removal of hashtags:</head><p>Hashtags didn't seem to play an important role in determining the labels for the given subtasks during our initial validation runs, therefore we decided to remove them from the tweet data points in our datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Removal of URLs:</head><p>Links or URLs don't necessarily contribute to the textual component of the tweet as they lack semantic meaning. We removed the URLs from the tweets, however considering that the presence of URLs may play an important role in determining specific tweet attributes, we added a categorical feature to represent URLs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Removal of Mentions:</head><p>We removed mentions represented by @username since they don't hold relevance to the given tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Substituting numeric values:</head><p>The presence of numerical values is an important factor in identifying characteristics such as verifiability as a number represents an objective fact that can be verified or negated. To make numeric representation uniform, we have replaced numeric figures with the string "number". Since our text is being conditioned by a large pre-trained model, we believe that it has the capability to pick up on the given contextualisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Data Augmentation</head><p>Data augmentation is the practice of increasing the diversity of training samples without collecting new data <ref type="bibr" coords="7,180.62,399.58,11.48,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,194.97,399.58,7.65,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>. We capitalised on the presence of multiple language datasets and used them to increase the quantity and diversity of training data points for Subtask 1A, Subtask 1B, and Subtask 1C.</p><p>The original training set for Subtask 1A, 1B, 1C for English consists of 2122, 3324, 3323 tweets, respectively. We translated the Bulgarian and Dutch datasets to English using the Google Translate library. We then appended the translated datasets for the respective tasks to the English dataset, yielding final datasets of sizes 4916, 7984, and 7977 for Subtasks 1A,1B, and 1C respectively. This marked a 231%, 240%, 240% increase in the training size, respectively. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,501.24,494.43,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_0">4</ref> reflects the sizes of the individual training sets and the final size of the augmented sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Feature Extraction Through Twitter API</head><p>The purpose of this task was to identify relevant claims in tweets and to achieve this, we decided to extract additional features that help in contextualising the textual content of the tweet. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,493.10,571.25,12.88,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> The additional features extracted include information about the tweet itself (the number of likes, retweets, and the presence of a URL in the tweet) as well as information about the author of the tweet (the number of followers, the number of users followed by the author, the number of previous tweets and whether the author has a verified account). Intuitively, the reason behind this is that given attributes of a tweet such as check-worthiness, verifiability, and harmful nature depend not just on the text of the tweet but the amount of engagement it has received as well as the digital footprint of the author.  Numerical Features:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As we can see in</head><p>• followers: number of followers of the author • following: number of users followed by the author • posts: number of previous posts by the author • likes: number of likes on the tweet • rts: number of retweets of the tweet All numerical features default to 0 when the relevant values are not available for like if the tweet has been deleted or the user has a private account.</p><p>Categorical Features: • verified: 1 if the user is verified, 0 otherwise • has_url: 1 if the tweet contains a URL, 0 otherwise</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Multimodal Model</head><p>Several methods have been used previously to combine textual input with additional features of a different modality. Models which combine transformers with visual inputs include ViLBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="9,89.29,306.77,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, VLBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="9,149.78,306.77,18.06,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and MMBT <ref type="bibr" coords="9,225.35,306.77,16.41,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Similarly, models exist which adapt to audio, visual, and text modalities such as MulT <ref type="bibr" coords="9,221.36,320.32,16.33,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Knowledge graph embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="9,384.11,320.32,17.99,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have also been used to combine additional textual features to transformers. The dataset we trained on this task took tabular data as input consisting numerical features and categorical features in addition to tweet texts.</p><p>Our model consists of individual Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on the numerical and categorical features. The outputs of the MLPs are concatenated with the outputs of the transformer before the final classification layer. The method can be represented by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="9,234.56,425.07,271.42,10.91">𝑚 = 𝑥||𝑀 𝐿𝑃 (𝑐)||𝑀 𝐿𝑃 (𝑛)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where || is the concatenation operator, x is output of transformer, m refers to the multimodal representation and c, n represent the categorical and numerical features respectively. The transformer used for this task was BERT (cite). BERT refers to Bidirectional Encoder Representations (cite). It uses bidirectional transformers (cite) pretrained using a combination of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). It learns deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context layers.</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure" coords="9,116.63,529.83,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_7">7</ref> represents the approach used by us for subtasks 1A, 1B, and 1C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Setup</head><p>The models have been trained on an augmented training set consisting of the English translated training sets of Bulgarian and Dutch combined with the English dataset for each subtask. The translation was done using the googletrans library in python. The models were developed using the Multimodal-Toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="9,353.86,628.93,16.08,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which combines transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="9,89.29,642.48,18.07,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> with tabular data. The transformer model chosen was bert-base-uncased from Hugging-Face <ref type="bibr" coords="9,112.79,656.03,16.42,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. A batch size of 8 with a variable learning rate was used to train the model. The combine method for the model is individual_mlps_on_cat_and_numerical_feats_then_concat with a dropout ratio of 0.1 and the division ratio as 4 for the MLPs. The models were trained on Google Colab GPU for 1 epoch each.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results</head><p>Our results for the three subtasks of Task 1 in which we participated are as follows:</p><p>1. Subtask 1A:</p><p>We ranked 9 out of the 13 teams that submitted for this subtask. The F1 score for the positive class for this task was 0.500.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Subtask 1B:</head><p>We ranked 2 out of the 10 teams that submitted for subtask 1B. The accuracy achieved on the test set by our model was 0.749. This accuracy score is very close to the score of the team ranking first on the leaderboard (0.761).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Subtask 1C:</head><p>We ranked 2 out of the 11 teams that submitted for subtask 1C. Our model achieved an F1 score of 0.361 on the test set, coming close to the team that ranked first having an F1 score of 0.397. For all the three subtasks, the results are on the English test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>Our model has given competitive results on all the subtasks we participated in. It performs especially well on Subtask 1B and Subtask 1C where we achieved scores of 0.749 (Accuracy) and 0.361 (F1) respectively. We ranked second on both these subtasks.</p><p>While our system gives comparable results to other teams in Subtask 1A, there is a performance gap compared to our performance in Subtask 1B and Subtask 1C. We believe that this primarily arises from a difference in the amount of training data. Our system had a uniform pipeline that performed data augmentation by combining the translated training sets of Bulgarian and Dutch. For subtask 1B and 1C, this resulted in datasets of size 7984 and 7977 tweets, while for Subtask 1A, the training size was limited to 4916 tweets. Moreover, we believe, the criteria for a tweet to be check worthy requires more subjective knowledge of the tweet as compared to detection of verifiability and harmfulness. Verifiability can be determined by the presence of numbers and objective facts and harmful tweets have common patterns. Both of these attributes are not present in reference to check-worthiness of a tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>The task of identifying relevant claims in tweets such as check-worthiness, verifiability, and harmfulness are becoming increasingly important in a world where a significant proportion of information flow happens through the web, and the point of dissemination is often social media platforms like Twitter. Task 1 of the CheckThat! 2022 aims specifically at identifying relevant claims in tweets.</p><p>The methodology used by our team involved data augmentation by translating appropriate datasets to English, followed by feature extraction from Twitter to get relevant attributes of the tweet and the author to make a better judgement in the task of identifying relevant claims. Finally, we used a model which combined BERT with tabular features and performed a multimodal analysis of the problem set. Our model achieved competitive results in all the subtasks we participated in.</p><p>The future work for our team involves optimising our current approach. We can work with more datasets for a larger scope of data augmentation. Further, we have the opportunity to work with different transformer-based models such as DistilBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="12,356.22,584.22,16.15,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="12,423.09,584.22,16.15,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, ALBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="12,487.00,584.22,16.15,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, ERNIE <ref type="bibr" coords="12,116.00,597.77,21.37,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="12,168.98,597.77,18.48,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.
