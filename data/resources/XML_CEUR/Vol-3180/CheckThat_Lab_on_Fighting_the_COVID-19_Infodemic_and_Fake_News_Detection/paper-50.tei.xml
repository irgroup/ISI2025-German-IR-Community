Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,328.21,536.99,14.48,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> defines the following subtasks:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Deep Learning and Pre-trained Deep Language Representation</head><p>Recent work on text classification uses neural networks, particularly Deep Learning (DL). Badjatiya et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.87,121.08,17.91,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> demonstrated that these architectures, including variants of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,169.56,134.63,16.56,10.91" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.76,134.63,12.59,10.91" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,206.00,134.63,12.42,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref>, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,402.25,134.63,16.41,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, or their combination (CharCNN, WordCNN, and HybridCNN), produce state-of-the-art results and outperform baseline methods (character n-grams, TF-IDF or bag-of-words representations).</p><p>Until recently, the dominant paradigm in approaching NLP tasks has been focused on the design of neural architectures, using only task-specific data and word embeddings such as those mentioned above. This led to the development of models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Convolution Neural Networks, which achieve significantly better results in a range of NLP tasks as compared to less complex classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression or Decision Tree Models. Badjatiya et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.68,243.03,17.91,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> demonstrated that these approaches outperform models based on character and word n-gram representations. In the same paradigm of pre-trained models, methods like BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,341.39,270.13,17.76,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and XLNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.67,270.13,17.75,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks.</p><p>Indeed, the usage of a pre-trained word embedding layer to convert the text into vectorized input for a neural network marked a significant step forward in text classification. The potential of pre-trained language models, e.g. Word2Vec <ref type="bibr" coords="3,305.02,324.32,16.41,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="3,358.25,324.32,16.41,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, fastText <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.74,324.32,16.42,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, or ELMo <ref type="bibr" coords="3,486.67,324.32,16.41,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, to capture the local patterns of features to benefit text classification, has been described by Castelle <ref type="bibr" coords="3,126.87,351.42,16.23,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Modern pre-trained language models use unsupervised learning techniques such as creating RNN embeddings on large text corpora to gain some primal "knowledge" of the language structures before a more specific supervised training steps in. Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. BERT-based models enforce a hard limit of 512 tokens, which is usually enough to process the majority of sequences in most benchmark datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">BERT, RoBERTa and Longformer</head><p>BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is based on the Transformer model architectures introduced by Vaswani et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,357.31,482.44,11.39,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The general approach consists of two stages: first, BERT is pre-trained on vast amounts of text, with an unsupervised objective of masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. Second, this pre-trained network is then fine-tuned on task specific, labeled data. The Transformer architecture is composed of two parts, an Encoder and a Decoder, for each of the two stages. The Encoder used in BERT is an attention-based architecture for NLP. It works by performing a small, constant number of steps. In each step, it applies an attention mechanism to understand relationships between all words in a sentence, regardless of their respective position. By pre-training language representations, the Encoder yields models that can either be used to extract high quality language features from text data, or fine-tune these models on specific NLP tasks (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.). We rely on RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.39,617.94,11.41,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a pre-trained Encoder model which builds on BERT's language masking strategy. However, it modifies key hyperparameters in BERT such as removing BERT's next-sentence pre-training objective, and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates. Furthermore, in comparison to BERT, the training data set for Roberta was an order of magnitude larger (160 GB of text) with the maximum sequence length of 512 used for all interations. This allows RoBERTa representations to generalize even better to downstream tasks.</p><p>To address the limitation of traditional Transformer-based models to 512 tokens, Longformer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,494.27,127.61,14.94,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> uses an attention pattern that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. To this end, the standard self-attention is replaced by an attention mechanism, which combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention, thus allowing up to 4096 position embeddings. Longformer is pre-trained from RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="4,125.56,195.36,15.55,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dataset</head><p>The training data for this task was developed during the CLEF-2021 CheckThat! campaign <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,267.54,16.56,10.91" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,108.96,267.54,12.59,10.91" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,124.67,267.54,14.11,10.91" target="#b24">25]</ref> and provided by Shahi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,273.21,267.54,16.29,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The AMUSED framework presented by Shahi <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,281.08,17.91,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> was used for data collection. The test data was gathered during CLEF 2022 CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="4,108.31,294.63,11.51,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The adopted task was framed as multi-class classification problem. Class labels were provided as credibility levels {false, partially false, true, other} as proposed by Shahi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.35,308.18,16.25,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The provided training set consists of 1,264 documents. As suggested by the organizers, a much larger training set was collected, combining data sets from comparable tasks such as the Fake News Detection Challenge KDD 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,262.87,348.83,16.41,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, as well as the Fake News Classification Datasets <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,362.38,16.25,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The resulting large training corpus also mentioned in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,353.43,362.38,17.91,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> consists of 51148 documents. The content parts are distributed between title and body of messages. Both fields were concatenated to serve as the input for training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Exploratory data analysis</head><p>Our approach is based on a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the training data.</p><p>Cleaning The initial training dataset consisted of 1264 documents. The explorative analysis started with the investigation of inconsistencies in the dataset. Unexpectedly, ambiguities in the annotation of the documents could be detected. For example, identical documents were found with contradictory annotations "true" vs. "false". In this case, we decided to remove all affected documents from the training data, regardless of the provided annotation. Removing    just one of the duplicates would have led to an inadvertent weighting of the remaining class.</p><p>After the elimination of the ambiguities, remaining unique duplicates could be easily removed.</p><p>The final cleansed dataset contained 1096 documents. We applied the same procedure to the 44910 documents for the large training corpus. The remainder of this study focuses on this adjusted version of the originbal dataset. Generally, duplicate data does not add any value since looking at the same data multiple times does not make the algorithm any better. However, if the distribution of duplicates is skewed towards one class only, a bias is to be expected in the resulting classification, throwing off the generalization performance, as the model is given information that overrepresents that class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Token count</head><p>The statistical summary of token counts in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,377.90,592.26,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> as well as Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,461.04,592.26,5.00,10.91" target="#fig_2">1</ref> suggests that most of the sequences of the training set exceed the limitation of trditional Transformerbased models to 512 tokens as described previously. Thus, anything beyond this limitation will be truncated. For this reason, after an initial training with RoBERTa at its core, we switched to Longformer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,140.03,646.45,15.22,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as the basic architecture, to gradually improve the overall score.  Unbalanced class distribution Imbalance in data can exert a major impact on the value and meaning of accuracy and on certain other well-known performance metrics of an analytical model. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,152.62,495.31,5.00,10.91">2</ref> depicts a clear skew towards false information. Furthermore, the "true" class is significantly underrepresented as compared to "partially false" class.</p><p>Topic structure To dissect content patterns in the training data, we made use of topic modeling. As unsupervised algorithms, topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,134.68,564.72,18.31,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (LDA) pick up on patterns and provide an overview of the information that the data contains. To help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference, topic coherence measures <ref type="bibr" coords="6,437.95,591.81,18.02,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> are utilzed measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in a given topic. In particular, a series of sensitivity tests were performed (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,394.30,618.91,4.25,10.91" target="#fig_6">4</ref>) to help determine the optimal number of topics as an essential model hyperparameter. Throughout the sensitivity tests CV was applied as coherence measure. CV creates content vectors of words using their co-occurrences. It is based on a sliding window, a one-set segmentation of the top words and an indirect confirmation measure that uses normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) and the cosinus similarity. To further improve the interpretability of the esulting topics, other coherence measures such as the UMass Coherence Score may also be explored. Based on these tests 15 was chosen as the optimal number of topics, since the coherence score does not change significantly even for a higher number of topics.  The resulting topic distributions as well as their high scoring words are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,500.32,424.21,3.67,10.91" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.</p><p>In fact, the distribution of labels differs significantly depending on the topic as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,120.36,451.31,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_8">6</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Our approach</head><p>Our approach is based on the assumption that differentiation of various viewpoints usually takes place in a topic-related manner. A topic results from a specific distribution over the words used. Via this distribution, different topics can be distinguished from each other. With our approach we propose a hierarchical method, where automatic text classification takes place on topic level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>Model Architecture Subtask 3A is given as a multi-class classification problem. The models for the experimental setup were based on RoBERTa and Longformer. For the classification task, fine-tuning is initially performed using RobertaForSequenceClassification <ref type="bibr" coords="7,403.05,641.97,17.68,9.72" target="#b33">[34]</ref> -roberta-base -as the pre-trained model. RobertaForSequenceClassification optimizes for a regression loss (Mean-Square Loss) using an AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate set to 2e-   done on NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPU using the Pytorch <ref type="bibr" coords="9,326.27,426.89,17.76,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref> framework with a vocabulary size of 50265 and an input size of 512. The model is trained to optimize the objective for 10 epochs. To estimate the performance of the resulting models we have chosen a ratio of 82/18 to split the data into training and validation set. We utilized both accuracy and the macro-averaged F1 score to assess the quality of the resulting models. As expected, the RoBERTa model architecture reaches its limitation due to the token counts as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,374.01,494.64,3.71,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Therefore, the overall score was significantly improved by replacing the basic architecture with a Longformer configuration which, eventually, was also the architecture utilized for the official submission.</p><p>The hierarchical arrangement of text classification is the essential part of our contribution. In this configuration, training and prediction are preceded by topic modeling to first dissect content patterns in the data being mediated. Topics are modelled as distributions over content words derived from documents. To this end, LDA is applied: based on the vocabulary of a document, topics can be assigned to it with a certain probability. The assignment of a particular document to a topic is determined by the highest association probability. The set of documents assigned to a particular topic form the training set for a topic-specific text classifier. Using the model architecture described above, a specific classifier was trained for each derived topic.</p><p>Of course, the described hierarchy must also be followed for the model prediction. Based on the previously trained topic model, documents from the test data are first assigned to a topic.</p><p>The prediction is then conducted by the dedicated classification model.</p><p>Both topic modeling and text classification are implemented in the form of a comprehensive pipeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input Embeddings</head><p>The input embedding layer converts the inputs into sequences of features: word-level sentence embeddings. These embedding features will be further processed by the subsequent encoding layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word-Level Sentence Embeddings</head><p>A sentence is split into words 𝑤 1 , ..., 𝑤 𝑛 with length of n by the WordPiece tokenizer <ref type="bibr" coords="10,232.38,211.50,16.09,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The word 𝑤 𝑖 and its index 𝑖 (𝑤 𝑖 's absolute position in the sentence) are projected to vectors by embedding sub-layers, and then added to the index-aware word embeddings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="10,234.43,252.88,126.42,48.34">𝑤 ˆ𝑖 = 𝑊 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑(𝑤 𝑖 ) 𝑢 ˆ𝑖 = 𝐼𝑑𝑥𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑(𝑖) ℎ 𝑖 = 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁 𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑤 ˆ𝑖 + 𝑢 ˆ𝑖)</formula><p>Target Encoding We encode the target labels using label encoding, although we assume the target variable to be categorical and non-ordinal. Since we do not assume a natural order, the substitution of the respective category by a natural number is done arbitrarily (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,497.01,345.34,3.55,10.91" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). This might pose a challenge and might be replaced by a multi-label binarizer as an analog of the one-hot (or one-of-K) scheme to multiple labels. It might also be useful to investigate the impact of an alternative order of the target encodings on the result. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results and Discussion</head><p>We participated in subtask 3A. Official evaluation results of the final submission on the test set are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,188.40,588.29,3.66,10.91">7</ref>. The entire classification report on this submission in shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,500.35,588.29,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Furthermore, the gold standard also allows the derivation of a corresponding confusion matrix (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,139.96,615.39,3.57,10.91" target="#fig_9">7</ref>). We focused on suitable combinations of deep learning methods as well as their hyperparameter settings. Fine-tuning pre-trained language models like RoBERTa or Longformer on downstream tasks has become ubiquitous in NLP research and applied NLP. Even without extensive preprocessing of the training data, we already achieve competitive results and our models can serve  as strong baseline models which, when fine-tuned, significantly outperform training models trained from scratch. The submission is based on the best performing model checkpoint on the validation set. In our case, of course, this evaluation had to take place at the topic level.</p><p>To identify potential improvements, our approach was applied to both the original training dataset and the large training corpus.</p><p>When improving on the pretrained baseline models, class imbalance appears to be a primary  challenge. This is clearly reflected in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,300.20,588.57,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. The poor performance, especially for the categories partially false and other, correlates with the distribution of training data across these categories (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,188.09,615.66,8.05,10.91">2b</ref>).</p><p>A commonly used tactic to deal with imbalanced datasets is to assign weights to each label. Alternative solutions for coping with unbalanced datasets for supervised machine learning are  undersampling or oversampling. Undersampling only considers a subset of an overpopulated class to end up with a balanced dataset. With the same goal, oversampling creates copies of the unbalanced classes. The influence of oversampling is evident from a comparison of both experiments on the original training data set (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="13,335.44,653.12,5.10,10.91" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="13,362.49,653.12,3.59,10.91" target="#tab_6">6</ref>). Thus, the macro-averaged F1 score was improved from 0.2550 to 0.2736. Overfitting poses the most difficult challenge in these experiments and reduces generalizability. In all three experiments, we observe the same pattern of misclassification, which is due to difficulties of the system to find discriminative features (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="14,350.96,481.83,38.10,10.91">Figure 7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,391.78,481.83,7.38,10.91" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,401.89,481.83,7.06,10.91" target="#b8">9)</ref>. The problem is most evident in the the poor performance of assigning the class label "true" on the test set. Most assigments were lost either to "false" and "partially false". This issue is potentially caused by flaws in the selection of the training data. Indeed, we can attribute part of this problem to content features. At its most basic level, there is a significant difference in the average document length of the documents used for training and prediction, respectively. Following Table <ref type="table" coords="14,499.57,549.58,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, significantly shorter documents were used for the training. The phenomenon is particularly evident for the category "true" (cf. Table <ref type="table" coords="14,279.26,576.68,3.65,10.91" target="#tab_8">8</ref>). To support this hypothesis, however, the high standard deviation in both statistics suggests further investigation into outliers, as median and quantiles suggest a smaller deviation between test and training data.</p><p>Further investigation examining lexical properties at the class level do not reflect significant differences in the training and testing data (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,326.86,630.87,7.74,10.91" target="#fig_13">10</ref>). Even the use of the much larger data set does not effect the overall pattern (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,308.36,644.42,3.57,10.91" target="#fig_9">7</ref>).</p><p>In fact, the problem may be due to a questionable choice of categories reflected in the class labels. In the case of the given task, the classification results suggest some kind of fact check. The system, however, is supposed to determine a truth value for an unseen document based solely on the available training data. We assume that in most cases external features contribute to the determination of the truth value of a certain statement. In particular, an individual's -this holds true for the sender as well as the receiver -worldview, contextual knowledge, and thematic context are crucial to their own decision. For this reason, linguistic means alone do not have enough discriminative power to robustly determine the truth value. Our approach is an attempt to narrow down the problem of distinguishing different views on a specific topic. Depending on the topic under investigation, we noticed significant differences in the performance of the trained systems with f1-scores ranging from 0.07 to 0.72.  With the above findings, we achieve state of the art performance on the text classification datasets. Transformer-based models such as RoBERTa or Longformer have proven to be powerful language representation model for various natural language processing tasks. As this study shows, they are also an effective tool for multi-class text classification. In the future, we will further investigate the inner workings of Transformer-based models and how to counteract their tendency to overfitting.</p></div>
