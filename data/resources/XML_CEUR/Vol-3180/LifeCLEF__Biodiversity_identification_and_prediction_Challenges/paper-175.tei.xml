<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>LifeCLEF 2022 is an evaluation campaign that is being organized as part of the CLEF initiative labs. This paper record solutions of two competitions in LifeCLEF 2022, i.e., SnakeCLEF 2022 and FungiCLEF 2022. The SnakeCLEF aims at building an automatic and robust image-based system for snake species identification while FungiCLEF aims at automatic recognize fungi species with both images and rich metadata. These two competitions contain a number of challenges, such as fine-grained image recognition, long-tailed recognition and openset recognition. In this paper, we utilize existing efficient techniques and tricks to deal with the long-tailed challenge in both SnakeCLEF and FungiCLEF. We also propose a new backbone by combining the large kernel convolution and vision transformer as both of them have shown superior performance in recognition tasks. For the SnakeCLEF competition, our team achieves a 85.4% Macro F1-Score on the private leaderboard while for the FungiCLEF competition, we achieve a 78.9% Macro F1-Score.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Building accurate knowledge of the identity and the evolution of species is essential for the sustainable development of humanity, as well as for biodiversity conservation. However, the difficulty of identifying animals and fungi is hindering the aggregation of new data and knowledge. Identifying and naming living organisms is almost impossible for the general public and is often difficult even for professionals and naturalists <ref type="bibr" coords="1,359.83,466.66,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The LifeCLEF Lab has been promoting and evaluating advances in this domain for over 10 years and has has achieved a lot of meaningful results <ref type="bibr" coords="1,186.60,493.75,11.36,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,200.68,493.75,7.47,10.91" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,210.88,493.75,7.57,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we combine existing effective techniques for the state-of-the-art pre-trained models and utilize advanced methods in the long-tailed recognition task to give solutions for both competitions (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,192.76,534.40,43.67,10.91">Section 4)</ref>. We also design a new backbone by combining two recent hot topics, i.e., large kernel convolution and vision transformers (cf. Section 3.1). Our overall strategy was to test as many models as possible and spend less time on fine-tuning. The goal was to have many diverse models for ensembling rather than some highly tuned ones. In the ensemble stage, our strategy was to choose the best combination that we thought can avoid overfitting and spend the rest of the time fitting the public leaderboard. In the following of this section, we introduce these two competitions once more.</p><p>CLEF 2022: Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, September 5-8, 2022, Bologna, Italy shenyang 98@njust.edu.cn (Y. Shen); sunxh@njust.edu.cn (X. Sun); zhuzijian@njust.edu.cn (Z. Zhu)</p><p>The SnakeCLEF competition aims at building an automatic and robust image-based system for snake species identification, which is an important goal for biodiversity, conservation, and global health. With recent estimates of 81,410-137,880 deaths and up to three times as many victims of amputations, permanent disability and disfigurement (globally each year) caused by venomous snakebite, such a system has the potential to improve eco-epidemiological data and treatment outcomes (e.g. based on the specific use of antivenoms). This applies especially in remote geographic areas and developing countries, where automatic snake species identification has the greatest potential to save lives. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.84,181.81,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,277.92,181.81,7.47,10.91" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.12,181.81,7.57,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>The FungiCLEF competition focuses on recognize fungi in the open world. Automatic recognition of fungi species assists mycologists, citizen scientists and nature enthusiasts in species identification in the wild. Its availability supports the collection of valuable biodiversity data. In practice, species identification typically does not depend solely on the visual observation of the specimen but also on other information available to the observer -such as habitat, substrate, location and time. Thanks to rich metadata, precise annotations, and baselines available to all competitors, the challenge provides a benchmark for image recognition with the use of additional information. Moreover, the toxicity of a mushroom can be crucial for the decision of a mushroom picker <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.52,303.75,11.36,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.60,303.75,7.47,10.91" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.80,303.75,7.57,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>.  For this year challenge, organizers prepared a dataset based on 187,129 snake observations with 318,532 photographs belonging to 1,572 snake species and observed in 208 countries. The data were gathered from the online biodiversity platform -iNaturalist. <ref type="foot" coords="3,404.56,98.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref>The provided dataset has a heavy long-tailed class distribution, where the most frequent species is represented by 6,472 images and the least frequent species by just 5 samples <ref type="bibr" coords="3,474.91,127.61,11.43,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.  The FungiCLEF challenge dataset is based on the data from the Danish Fungi 2020 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.15,453.62,11.28,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which contains 295,938 training images belonging to 1,604 species observed mostly in Denmark.</p></div>

The F1 score, commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics precision (P) and recall (R).</p><p>The macro F1 score is not biased by class frequencies and is more suitable for the long-tailed class distributions observed in nature. Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to all predicted positives (TP + FP). The Recall is the ratio of true positives (TP) to all actual positives (TP + FN). The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good performance on both will be favoured over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other. the huge potential of attention-based models. However, self-attention is originally designed for NLP. It has three shortcomings when dealing with computer vision tasks. (1) It treats images as 1D sequences which neglects the 2D structure of images. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images.</p></div>

To solve these problems, we propose a novel visual attention method, namely, LKA. It involves the pros of self-attention such as adaptability and long range dependence. Besides, it benefits from the advantages of convolution such as making use of local contextual information. We first introduce the CoLKANet. Actually, it is a combination of large kernel attention (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,107.96,492.09,4.12,10.91" target="#fig_5">3</ref>) and vision transformer. Since the breakthrough of AlexNet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.16,492.09,17.84,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and ResNet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,454.62,492.09,17.83,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominating model architecture for computer vision. Meanwhile, with the success of self-attention models in natural language processing, many previous works have attempted to bring in the power of attention into computer vision. When pre-trained on large-scale weakly labeled JFT-300M dataset, ViT can achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art CNNs. In this year, researchers revisited large kernel design in CNNs and found that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a stack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,221.42,586.94,16.10,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. From previous research, we can see that earlier convolution helps transformer see better. Therefore, following this idea, we combine large kernel attention with vision transformer. We use the structure in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,309.59,614.03,37.19,10.91">VAN [9]</ref> and by following CoAtnet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,469.60,614.03,16.39,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we replace those earlier CNN structures. Overall structure of the CoLKANet can refer to Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,488.48,627.58,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. </p></div>

We choose the combination of Swin Transformer, VOLO, ConvNeXt, ViT and our CoLKANet as the final solution. We found that CNNs are more likely to overfit in this competition (except ConvNeXt) while Transformer seems to be more stable. However, when raising the input resolution of ConvNeXt and EfficientNet, it will gain a substantial improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Details for Vision Transformers</head><p>For different competitions, we use different settings for vision transformers.</p><p>SnakeCLEF. We use ViT, Swin Transformer, VOLO and the proposed CoLKANet as backbones. We calculate the 5-fold cross validation accuracy while training with the image resolution of 384 × 384 for Swin Transformer and 448 × 448 for VOLO.

We choose 1.2 × 10 4 as the initial learning rate while 10 -5 /7 as the minimum learning rate and set weight decay as 2×10 -5 . A good technique to reduce overfitting is to stop the model from becoming overconfident. This can be achieved by softening the ground truth using Label Smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="5,407.84,622.70,16.39,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Loss Functions</head><p>As the evaluation metric is Macro F1-Score, we have to deal with the long-tailed problem (If the evaluation metric is Micro F1-Score, adpot the original Cross Entropy Loss is enough.). Because the head classes contain much more training examples, the network makes the weight norm of the head classes larger to approach the optimal solution. It results in predicted probabilities mainly near 1.0. Another fact is that distributions of predicted probability are related to instance numbers. Unlike balanced recognition, applying different strategies for these classes is necessary for solving the long-tailed problem. Therefore, we adopt label-aware smoothing <ref type="bibr" coords="6,450.47,443.85,17.98,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to solve the over-confidence in cross-entropy and varying distributions of predicted probability issues for both SnakeCLEF and FungiCLEF. It is expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="6,147.56,494.75,358.43,33.72">𝑙(𝑞, 𝑝) = - 𝐾 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝑞 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑞 𝑖 = {︃ 1 -𝜖 𝑦 = 1 -𝑓 (𝑁 𝑦 ), 𝑖 = 𝑦 , 𝜖𝑦 𝐾-1 = 𝑓 (𝑁𝑦) 𝐾-1 , otherwise ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where 𝜖 𝑦 is a small label smoothing factor for Class-𝑦, relating to its class number 𝑁 𝑦 . Details about label-aware smoothing can refer the original paper <ref type="bibr" coords="6,346.61,552.99,16.25,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. It also worth noting that if we increase the weight of some tail classes and head classes, we will get a higher score on the public leaderboard (but useless in private leaderboard). We explain this phenomenon in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Important Tricks</head><p>Bellow are 8 important tricks we used during both SnakeCLEF and FungiCLEF.</p><p>• Augmentation: Augmentation is very import during training stage. We tried combination of RandomResizedCrop, Transpose, HorizontalFlip, VerticalFlip, ShiftScaleRotate, IAAPiece-wiseAffine, HueSaturationValue, RandomBrightnessContrast, OpticalDistortion, GridDistortion, ElasticTransform, Cutout and CoarseDropout designed in Albumentations <ref type="bibr" coords="7,419.05,127.61,17.82,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> at the begining of the competitions. During the middle stage, we replaced them with TrivialAugment <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.91,141.16,18.07,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and gain around 0.5% improvement for each single model. We also used Random Erasing <ref type="bibr" coords="7,486.88,154.71,16.24,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, CutMix <ref type="bibr" coords="7,125.64,168.26,17.88,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and Mixup <ref type="bibr" coords="7,196.88,168.26,17.88,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> throughout the competitions. They provide strong regularization effects by softening not only the labels but also the images.</p><p>• Confusion Matrix: A typical way to analyze model performance is using the confusion matrix. As we split the training images into 5 equal parts (i.e., 5-fold), we get the confusion matrix from the valid part when training those 5-fold models (We did not use confusion matrix for models trained with the whole dataset). This trick gain around 0.2% improvement when ensemble different models.</p><p>• Normalization of Output: Besides confusion matrix, we hope to vote for each model (e.g., Models A, B and C predict that the image belongs to category 1, 2, 1 respectively. Finally we set the image as category 1.) but it performs poor. So we temporarily set another trick, i.e., scale the model output and normalize the maximum value to 𝛼, 𝛼 can not be one for it may be too close to the voting strategy, formula is as follows:</p><p>𝑁 𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑓 (𝑥)) = (1/𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑓 (𝑥))) 𝛼 𝑓 (𝑥) .</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="7,498.27,341.81,7.72,10.91">)<label>3</label></formula><p>It is found that models performs well when 𝛼 is 0.15 or 0.20. This trick gain around 0.1% improvement when ensemble different models.</p><p>• Test Time Augementation: It is an very important trick during all the competitions. However, it may lead to overfitting. Performing this trick is very easy: just crop the test images for around 8 to 13 times and calculate the average score. It gains around 0.6% improvement for each single model but unfortunately, it did not work on the private leaderboard in SnakeCLEF.</p><p>• Pseudo Labelling: We only perform pseudo labelling for SnakeCLEF. This trick did not work in FungiCLEF (We only tried it once and it did not work on public leaderboard. This may be caused by the openset problem.). We generate pseudo labels on test dataset only for tail categories (train data less than 100) by clustering methods, and finetune the model on both training and these test data. It gains around 0.9% improvement on the public leaderboard but useless on the private leaderboard.</p><p>• Weight Decay Tuning: Our standard recipe uses ℓ2 regularization to reduce overfitting. The Weight Decay parameter controls the degree of the regularization (the larger the stronger) and is applied universally to all learned parameters of the model by default <ref type="bibr" coords="7,430.18,556.01,16.37,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. More about separating the Normalization parameters from the rest can refer ClassyVision <ref type="bibr" coords="7,437.63,569.56,16.25,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>• Exponential Moving Average (EMA): EMA <ref type="bibr" coords="7,308.54,583.11,18.07,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is a technique that allows one to push the accuracy of a model without increasing its complexity or inference time. It performs an exponential moving average on the model weights and this leads to increased accuracy and more stable models. The averaging happens every few iterations and its decay parameter was tuned via grid search.</p><p>• FixRes mitigations: It is a very important trick in CNNs (Transformers fix image size so it can not be used) and we only use this trick in ConvNeXt. The model performed significantly better if the resolution used during validation was increased from the training size. This effect is studied in detail on the FixRes paper <ref type="bibr" coords="8,218.02,100.52,17.82,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and two mitigations are proposed: a) one could try to reduce the training resolution so that the accuracy on the validation resolution is maximized or b) one could fine-tune the model on a two-phase training so that it adjusts on the target resolution. Another very important phenomenon is that if we improve the resolution of training images, we will easily gain a better score. The image scaling ratio is set as 0.758 and 0.875 according to the experiments in the original paper <ref type="bibr" coords="8,272.69,168.26,18.06,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="8,312.95,168.26,18.06,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . It gains around 0.8% improvement in SnakeCLEF but only 0.2% improvement in FungiCLEF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Gap Between the Public Leaderboard and Private Leaderboard.</head><p>First of all, at the begining of these two competitions, the most important thing is to guess the data distribution of the test dataset. Based on our experience, we guessed that the data distribution for the test dataset should be roughly the same as the provided train/val dataset, and the scores for the 20% data which showed on the public leaderboard should also fit the distribution of the test dataset (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,256.23,325.61,17.77,10.91" target="#fig_7">5 (b)</ref>). However, during these two competitions, we found if we artificially increase the weight of some categories (especially on SnakeCLEF which did not suffer from OSR), we would get a better score on the public leaderboard. These categories were chosen at random and the best random state gain around 1% improvement on the public leaderborad. At the outset, we thought it a mismatch in the number of some tail categories between the training dataset and the test dataset.</p><p>While towards the end of these two competitions, we made a rather important discovery. In the FungiCLEF competition, if we submit a csv with all labels set as -1, we can get a score of about 0.0005 on the public leaderboard. As the FungiCLEF competition contains 1,604 categories. We derived this score backwards by using the formula for Macro-F1 and got a result that the whole dataset should contain about 60% to 70% openset images (i.e., label= -1).</p><p>Give an example, assuming a total of 59,420 results are to be submitted, then 34,000 of these results have a ground truth of -1 and the other 25,000 samples between 0 and 1,603, a document with all -1's has a macro F1 value of approximately 0.00045. We added this threshold to our earlier submissions and, not surprisingly, the score dropped dramatically. Obviously this is an unreasonable result. Therefore, we had a wild guess: 20% of the data in the public leaderboard, which means, randomly select 20% of these 1,604 categories in FungiCLEF to calculate the score (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="10,150.82,555.94,14.45,10.91" target="#fig_7">5 (c</ref>)). The same goes for the SnakeCLEF.</p><p>In this setting, we calculate the openset images in the whole dataset should be around 10%. However, the overall strategy: fitting the public leaderboard, seems overfitted. The fungi competition, on the other hand, did not have a significant reduction on the private leaderboard after adjusting the appropriate threshold, as the -1 category had a far greater effect than the other categories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Only A Threshold Strategy is Sufficient for the Openset Problem.</head><p>The ability to identify whether or not a test sample belongs to one of the semantic classes in a classifier's training set is critical to practical deployment of the model. Sagar Vaze et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,103.04,134.63,18.07,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref> demonstrated that the ability of a classifier to make the 'none-of-above' decision is highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes. They also use this correlation to boost the performance of the maximum softmax probability OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set accuracy and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of OSR benchmarks. Therefore, we only use a simple threshold for the FungiCLEF competition. We also tried post-processing with meta data (by using MetaFormer <ref type="bibr" coords="11,400.67,202.38,17.10,10.91" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) but useless in this competition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Fine-grained image recognition is an important problem in computer vision. Combined with the long-tailed problem and the openset problem, the SnakeCLEF and the FungiCLEF become more challenging. In this paper, we report the advanced techniques we had used to deal with these challenges. By combining the recent hot topics in computer vision tasks, i.e., large kernel and vision transformer, we also construct a new model named CoLKANet. For the SnakeCLEF competition, our team achieves a 85.4% Macro F1-Score on the private leaderboard. For the FungiCLEF competition, our team achieves a 78.9% Macro F1-Score on the private leaderboard.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,362.25,149.33,10.71;2,223.62,480.02,51.04,8.51;2,333.43,545.28,72.04,8.51;2,181.00,554.14,8.51,18.56;2,181.00,534.85,8.51,17.10;2,181.00,512.64,8.51,20.02;2,181.00,479.18,8.51,31.25;2,284.18,587.16,84.59,8.51"><head>2. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Dataset for SnakeCLEF[Natrix natrix] [Pseudonaja guttata] Head class (most samples) Tail class (most classes)</figDesc></figure>
