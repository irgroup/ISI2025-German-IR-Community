<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report on the systems that the Math Information Retrieval group at Masaryk University (mirmu) and the team of Faculty of Informatics students (msm) prepared for task 1 (find answers) of the arqmath lab at the clef conference. To study the effects of different system settings and hyperparameters, we have prototyped several diverse math-aware information retrieval (mir) systems: both "old" inverted index-based ones and new neural ones. By ensembling the results of the "weak" individual systems into committees, we report on entailments, benefits, and drawbacks of system ensembling. We evaluated the proposed individual systems and ensembles, considering their diversity, hyperparameters, and representations used, and classified their approaches. Our prototypes have helped to understand the challenging problems of question-answering in the stem domain: the key lies in the proper representation of document semantics. Our reproducible evaluation Python library PV211-utils allows to reproduce and further advance mir re-search.</p></div>

As in the previous year <ref type="bibr" coords="1,418.19,486.85,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we formed two teams, mirmu and msm. Under the mirmu team, we submitted five different versions of the deep neural information system, which tries to overcome the performance of tf-idf likes systems. Under the msm group, we submitted different versions of the student information systems and their ensemble with the best variant from the mirmu submission. Finally, we report that an ensemble of all fine-tuned individual systems' by reciprocal rank fusion performed best.</p><p>Our arqmath reports <ref type="bibr" coords="1,204.87,568.14,11.48,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,219.82,568.14,9.03,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref> showed promising directions stemming from the enormous capacity of neural languages models, their ensembling <ref type="bibr" coords="1,334.55,581.69,11.46,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, their different training sets, hyperparametrization, input preprocessing, and math tokenization.</p><p>Our systems were mainly developed as part of the Information Retrieval course PV211 and will allow reproducible research using Python package PV211-utils <ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.60,100.52,11.43,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In Section 2 we describe resources and methods used to train and develop our systems. Section 3 describes systems and strategies used to prepare our runs. We report and evaluate our results in Section 4 on page 6. We are summing up our conclusions with Section 5, drawing possible research plans based on computed metrics and availability of collected systems, ensembling techniques, and ground truth datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Datasets and Methods</head><p>This section describes the math representations ingested by our information retrieval systems, the corpora used for training the models that power our systems, and the relevance judgments we used for parameter optimization, model selection, and performance estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Math Input Representations</head><p>We used the most straightforward math representation for all our submitted systems: L A T E X.</p><p>In one submitted run of mirmu group, we studied the effect of the L A T E X encoding of math compared to the sole text to see how the presence of the math representation affects the resulting score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Datasets and Methods</head><p>We described our datasets, ensembling methods, and evaluation measures in detail in our previous reports <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.91,407.64,12.68,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and [2, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,210.20,407.64,41.91,10.91">Section 2]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Systems Description</head><p>The following sections describe nine systems students have developed as part of their studies. Their diversity brings different ways to represent the meaning of math content and how to pick and rerank the answers for given topics. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,298.85,506.91,5.08,10.91">1</ref> on page 7 summarizes ten submitted runs by both MU teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Retriever + ReRanker System</head><p>Our systems submitted under the mirmu group consist of the following parts applied sequentially after one another, inspired by RE 3 QA architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="2,314.75,583.74,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>• Indexer -to assign each document a dense vector representation; • Retriever -to compute the dense vector representation of the input query and to compute the cosine similarity between query and each document representation and sorting all documents by this similarity;</p><p>• ReRanker -to rerank top-𝑘 most relevant documents from Retrieving part. We achieved the best results with tiered reranking, taking multiple non-overlapping slices from top-𝑘 results and reranks each slice separately. This part is computationally expensive; therefore, we cannot do it on the whole dataset in practice.</p><p>For implementing our system, we used the Sentence Transformer library, which is the Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text, and image embeddings. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,400.55,163.68,12.84,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Implementation and Hyper-parameters</head><p>For the implementation of the Base model, we used the BiEncoder model with the pre-trained all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,223.10,226.56,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.

The architecture of both models and their differences are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,352.82,294.30,3.75,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The Base model fine-tuned only the ReRanker model, as the fine-tuning of the generic Retriever pre-trained for a retrieval on a vast and heterogeneous datasets did not bring measurable benefits of quality. We submitted fine-tuned version of the ReRanker as the alternative run.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">ReRanker fine-tuning</head><p>The ReRanker was fine-tuned using the BCE with logits loss and the AdamW optimizer. The training set consisted of relevance judgments, a train+validation set from ARQMath 2021, extended by additional samples. The additional positive samples, with the label equal to 1, were pairs of a question and an answer from the same thread, where the answer received at least 50 upvotes. The additional negative samples, with the label equal to 0, were the most similar documents given by Retriever but with no overlapping Math Stack Exchange tags. Because finding similar documents for all questions would not be feasible, we decided to generate ten negative samples for ten random questions at the start of each epoch.</p><p>The model was trained on all training queries and the same number of additional samples every epoch. The ratio of positive and negative samples was 0.5. The training process was stopped as there was no decrease in loss over the test set from ARQMath 2021.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Description of Individual Runs</head><p>For the mirmu team, we submitted different versions of the described system to see the effect of the different components of the system. The variation we used are:</p><p>• finetuning / not finetuning of the Retriever model • using ReRanker model pretrained on the Math texts (RoBERTa vs MathBERTa<ref type="foot" coords="3,463.47,618.31,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> ) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,473.66,620.07,17.91,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• using different representation of the input (text vs text + L A T E X)</head><p>We submitted the Base model as the primary as we couldn't outperform its performance. The other variants we submitted as the alternative runs are:</p><p>• Base -model described in the previous section;</p><p>• Trained only on text -system using only the text representation of documents and queries; • MathBERTa ReRanker -system using MathBERTa model as the ReRanker;</p><p>• Retriever fine-tuned -Retriever model adjusted by the relevance judgements collected over ARQMath2020 and ARQMath 2021, using Negatives Ranking loss <ref type="bibr" coords="4,432.68,415.95,16.43,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,451.83,415.95,7.69,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>; • MathBERTa ReRanker + Retriever fine-tuned -system with MathBERTa ReRanker and fine-tuned Retriever model.</p><p>To quantify the effect of the individual changes in the mirmu system, only one parameter was changed at time for given run, and all other hyperparameters were left the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">tf-idf</head><p>As one of the students' baseline systems, we used the tf-idf model implementation available in the Gensim library <ref type="bibr" coords="4,175.85,541.55,16.25,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In the preprocessing phase, we removed extreme values (below 8 absolute term frequency and higher than 0.7 relative document frequency), where we chose the hyperparameters experimentally on train subset. Then we removed punctuation, repeating whitespaces. Lastly, we tokenized the document by splitting on whitespace and stemmed individual tokens using the snowball stemmer available in snowball_py <ref type="foot" coords="4,286.12,607.55,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> library.</p><p>We used smart (System for the Mechanical Analysis and Retrieval of Text) 𝑙 𝑛 𝑐 tf-idf weighting variant <ref type="bibr" coords="4,142.16,636.40,16.42,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.

We represented our answers as a concatenation of its body and title, body, and tags of its parent question. In the next preprocessing stage, we firstly removed punctuation, repeating whitespaces, and English stopwords. Then we transformed the text into lowercase and stemmed it using Porter stemmer. Lastly, we tokenized the text by splitting it on whitespace.</p><p>We used the implementation of BM25 + in the rank_bm25 Python library <ref type="bibr" coords="5,420.67,317.32,17.76,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> with its default hyperparameters.</p></div>

The tf-idf system uses the same preprocessing as BM25 system and tf-idf implementation available in the Gensim library with smart 𝑙 𝑡 𝑛 tf-idf weighting variant, which corresponds to logarithmic term frequency weighting, zero-corrected idf, and no document normalization.</p></div>

The more diverse systems one combines, the more the quality metric as ndcg ′ monotonously grows. As the math information systems have to cope with really complex problems, it is really hard to build one complex system that is capable of learning all the complex stuff: disambiguation of overloaded math symbols, structured ambiguous notation, deduction and long causal dependencies.   The Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,150.87,432.55,5.03,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the dependence of rrf quality on the parameter 𝑘. Instead of suggested 𝑘 = 60 from the original paper, the best performance is with 𝑘 = 180. We hypotetize that the more diverse the primary systems are, the higher optimal parameter 𝑘 scores.</p><p>It remains to be studied to which extend the performance depends on participating individual systems. Also, how the performance change with different hyperparameters and initial setting and choices of pre-trained models, diversity and initial setup of individual systems.</p><p>For reproducibility, we are going to publish our notebooks, ensemble implementations and models in our lab and course repository <ref type="bibr" coords="9,269.21,527.40,11.43,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>"You must cultivate activities that you love.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>We have developed nine mir systems with as diverse approaches and variants as possible. We have evaluated them on available arqmath data from last three years. We have studied the ways how they could be ensembled to gain better performance. We have reported our findings: a) math-aware representation with deep models started to outperform flat token-level based systems b) ensembling done with expertise and insight about merits of individual systems matter.</p><p>In the future, we plan to further enhance our neural models and ensembling algorithms by several means:</p><p>• evaluation of different ensembling strategies based on individual systems' types and hyperparameter settings of neural systems; • evaluation of initial setting and hyperparameters of neural Retriever and ReRanker systems; • deep systems' adaptation to math specifics by using Adapt𝒪r library <ref type="bibr" coords="10,425.54,220.59,16.39,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>;</p><p>• study robustness and out-of-domain performance of mir systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,243.57,300.23,4.82;4,88.93,255.53,279.87,4.79;4,160.97,84.19,270.85,150.97"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Bi-Encoder vs Cross-Encoder model scheme (image taken from www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html)</figDesc><graphic coords="4,160.97,84.19,270.85,150.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
