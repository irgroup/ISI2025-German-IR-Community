<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sparse retrieval techniques can detect exact matches, but are inadequate for mathematical texts, where the same information can be expressed as either text or math.

We evaluate the impact of different math representations, different notions of similarity between key words and math symbols ranging from Levenshtein distances to deep neural language models, and different ways of combining text and math.</p><p>We show that using the soft vector space model consistently improves effectiveness compared to using standard sparse retrieval techniques. We also show that the Tangent-L math representation achieves better effectiveness than LaTeX, and that modeling text and math separately using two models improves effectiveness compared to jointly modeling text and math using a single model. Lastly, we show that different math representations and different ways of combining text and math benefit from different notions of similarity between tokens. Our best system achieves NDCG' of 0.251 on Task 1 of the ARQMath-3 lab.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>State-of-the-art math information retrieval systems use sparse retrieval techniques that can detect exact key word matches with high precision, but fail to retrieve texts that are semantically similar but use different terminology. This shortcoming is all the more apparent with mathematical texts, where the same information can be expressed in two completely different systems of writing and thought: the natural language and the language of mathematics.</p><p>Recently, the soft vector space model of Sidorov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,356.51,547.23,18.27,4.94" target="#b31">[25]</ref> made it possible to retrieve documents according to both exact and fuzzy key word matches and has outperformed standard sparse retrieval techniques on semantic text similarity <ref type="bibr" coords="1,330.04,574.33,11.28,4.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, text classification <ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.89,574.33,16.04,4.94" target="#b22">[17]</ref>, and machine translation evaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,192.11,587.87,18.27,4.94" target="#b32">[26]</ref> tasks. The soft vector space has been used for math information retrieval in the ARQMath-1 and 2 labs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.64,601.42,16.74,4.94" target="#b23">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,284.12,601.42,12.56,4.94" target="#b20">16]</ref>. However, it has not been properly compared to sparse retrieval baselines. Furthermore, the soft vector space model makes it possible to use different representations of math, different notions of similarity between key words and symbols, and different ways to combine text and math. However, neither of these possibilities has been previously explored.</p><p>In our work, we aim to answer the following four research questions:</p><p>1. Does the soft vector space model outperform sparse information retrieval baselines on the math information retrieval task?</p><p>2. Which math representation works best with the soft vector space model?</p><p>3. Which notion of similarity between key words and symbols works best?</p><p>4. Is it better to use a single soft vector space model to represent both text and math or to use two separate models?</p><p>The rest of our paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we describe our system and our experimental setup. In Section 3, we report and discuss our experimental results. We conclude in Section 4 by answering our research questions and summarizing our contributions.</p></div>

To evaluate the impact of constrained positional weighting on math information retrieval, we trained word2vec models both with and without constrained positional weighting for every dataset.

This motivated us to experiment with adaptation incorporating specific encodings for non-textual expressions.</p><p>To model text and math in the LaTeX format, we replaced the tokenizer of roberta-base with our text and math tokenizer. Then, we extended the vocabulary of our model with the [MATH] and [/MATH] special tokens and with the tokens recognized by our LaTeX tokenizer, and we randomly initialized weights for the new tokens.

For semantic similarity matrices, we also enforced strict diagonal dominance, which has been shown to improve performance on the semantic text similarity task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,452.04,130.88,16.10,4.94" target="#b22">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,470.58,130.88,33.38,4.94">Table 2]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, to produce token similarity matrices that capture both lexical and semantic similarity between tokens, we combined every semantic similarity matrix with a corresponding lexical similarity matrix as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,111.97,193.50,394.67,9.97">Combined similarity = 𝛼 • Lexical similarity + (1 -𝛼) • Semantic similarity (1)</formula><p>In our system, we only used the combined token similarity matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Soft Vector Space Modeling</head><p>In order to find answers to math questions, we used sparse retrieval with the soft vector space model of Sidorov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,186.91,283.82,15.93,4.94" target="#b31">[25]</ref>, using Lucene BM25 [6, Table <ref type="table" coords="6,334.59,283.82,4.39,4.94">1</ref>] as the vector space and our combined similarity matrices as the token similarity measure. To address the bimodal nature of math questions and answers, we used the following two approaches: <ref type="foot" coords="6,369.01,308.28,7.41,3.61" target="#foot_12">13</ref>Joint models To allow users to query math information using natural language and vise versa, we used single soft vector space models to jointly represent both text and math.</p><p>As our baselines, we used 1) Lucene BM25 with the text dictionary and no token similarities and 2) Lucene BM25 with the text + LaTeX dictionary and no token similarities.</p><p>We also used four soft vector space models with the text + LaTeX dictionary and the token similarity matrices from the positional and non-positional word2vec models, the roberta-base model, and the MathBERTa model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpolated models</head><p>To properly represent the different frequency distributions of text and math tokens, we used separate soft vector space models for text and math.

To represent an answer in the soft vector space model, we used the tokens in the title of its parent question and in the body text of the answer. To give greater weight to tokens in the title, we repeated them 𝛾 times, which proved useful in ARQMath-2 [16, Section 3.2].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Robustness to Parameter Variations</head><p>In tables 1-4, the differences between hand-picked and optimized parameter values for joint models are within 0.002 NDCG' except Joint text (roberta-base), which improves effectiveness by 0.041 NDCG' by placing more weight on the lexical similarity of tokens (𝛼: 0.1 → 0.6) and by placing less weight on question titles (𝛾: 5 → 2). This shows that our joint vector space models are relatively robust to parameter variations. By contrast, optimizing parameter values for the Interpolated text + Tangent-L (positional word2vec) model improves effectiveness by 0.098 NDCG'. Compared to the hand-picked parameter values, the optimized parameter values place more weight on the lexical similarity for text tokens (𝛼 1 : 0.1 → 0.7), use only semantic similarity for math tokens (𝛼 2 : 0.1 → 0.0), place less weight on the text in question titles (𝛾 1 : 5 → 2), and place more weight on math over text (𝛽: 0.5 → 0.7).</p></div>

Using roberta-base as the source of semantic similarity between text tokens improves effectiveness by 0.012 NDCG', reaching NDCG' of 0.247. By contrast, including also LaTeX math tokens reduces effectiveness by 0.011 NDCG', reaching NDCG' of 0.224, which we attribute to the difficulty to properly represent the different frequency distributions of text and math tokens in a single joint model. However, when we also use either positional word2vec or MathBERTa as the source of semantic similarity between text and math tokens, effectiveness improves by 0.025 NDCG', reaching NDCG' of 0.249. Removing the positional weighting from word2vec further improves effectiveness by 0.002 NDCG', reaching NDCG' of 0.251, which is the best result among our joint models.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,130.83,658.69,4.99,4.94" target="#fig_1">2</ref> also shows that the Interpolated text + LaTeX (no token similarities) baseline receives NDCG' of 0.257.

Furthermore, all joint and interpolated models for text place equal weight on question titles (𝛾 and 𝛾 1 of 2). By contrast, all joint models for text and math and the interpolated models for math place comparatively higher weight on the math in question titles (𝛾 and 𝛾 2 between 3 and 5). This indicates that math in question titles is more informative than text in question titles. Additionally, all interpolated models for LaTeX math only used the lexical similarity of tokens (𝛼 2 : 1.0). By contract, all interpolated models for Tangent-L math only used the semantic similarity of tokens (𝛼 2 : 0.0).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we aimed to answer the following research questions:</p><p>1. Does the soft vector space model outperform sparse information retrieval baselines on the math information retrieval task?</p><p>2. Which math representation works best with the soft vector space model?</p><p>3. Which notion of similarity between key words and symbols works best?</p><p>4. Is it better to use a single soft vector space model to represent both text and math or to use two separate models?</p><p>Using our experimental results, we can answer our research questions as follows:  <ref type="bibr" coords="11,265.33,162.53,16.46,8.87" target="#b33">[27]</ref> 0.504 MiniLM+RoBERTa from MIRMU <ref type="bibr" coords="11,292.14,174.48,16.46,8.87" target="#b33">[27]</ref> 0.498 L8_a018 from MathDowsers <ref type="bibr" coords="11,272.34,186.44,11.83,8.87" target="#b6">[7]</ref> 0.474 math_10 from TU_DBS <ref type="bibr" coords="11,254.51,198.39,16.46,8.87" target="#b27">[22]</ref> 0  <ref type="bibr" coords="11,314.91,365.77,16.46,8.87" target="#b14">[12]</ref> 0.229 Joint Text + LaTeX (no token similarities) 0.224 TF-IDF (PyTerrier) baseline <ref type="bibr" coords="11,268.37,389.68,16.46,8.87" target="#b14">[12]</ref> 0.190 Tangent-S baseline <ref type="bibr" coords="11,235.83,401.63,16.46,8.87" target="#b14">[12]</ref> 0.159 Linked MSE Posts baseline <ref type="bibr" coords="11,266.48,413.59,16.46,8.87" target="#b14">[12]</ref> 0.106 1. Yes, using the soft vector space model to capture the semantic similarity between tokens consistently improves effectiveness on ARQMath-3 Task 1, both for just text and for text combined with different math representations.</p><p>2. Among LaTeX and Tangent-L, our soft vector space models using Tangent-L achieve the highest effectiveness on ARQMath-3 Task 1.</p><p>3. Among lexical and semantic similarity, all joint models and the interpolated models for text reach their highest effectiveness on ARQMath-3 Task 1 by combining both lexical and semantic similarity, but place slightly more weight on lexical similarity. The interpolated models for math gave mixed results: The model for Tangent-L reaches the highest efficiency by using only semantic similarity, whereas the model for LaTeX reaches the highest efficiency by using only lexical similarity.</p><p>Among sources of semantic similarity, joint models achieve comparable effectiveness on ARQMath-3 Task 1 with non-positional word2vec, positional word2vec, and Math-BERTa, and interpolated models achieved comparable effectiveness with non-positional word2vec and positional word2vec. This may indicate that the soft vector space model does not fully exploit the semantic information provided by the sources of semantic similarity and therefore does not benefit from their improvements after a certain threshold.</p><p>4. All our interpolated models achieved higher effectiveness on ARQMath-3 Task 1 than our joint models. This shows that it is generally better to use two separate models to represent text and math even at the expense of losing the ability to model the similarity between text and math tokens.</p><p>Our answers to research questions 2 and 3 also provide the following new questions:</p><p>2. Are there other math representations besides LaTeX and Tangent-L that may work better with the soft vector space model?</p><p>3. How can the soft vector space model be parametrized or improved, so that it can benefit from improved measures of similarity between tokens?</p><p>These questions should provide a fruitful venue for future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,361.06,132.87,6.37,8.74;8,384.47,132.87,48.45,9.14;8,162.35,150.57,131.07,8.87;8,361.06,150.57,61.80,8.87;8,162.35,162.53,260.50,8.87;8,162.35,174.48,167.71,8.87;8,361.06,174.48,61.80,8.87;8,162.35,186.44,111.26,8.87;8,361.06,186.44,61.80,8.87"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>text + LaTeX (non-positional word2vec) 0.1 5 0.249 Joint text + LaTeX (positional word2vec)</figDesc></figure>
