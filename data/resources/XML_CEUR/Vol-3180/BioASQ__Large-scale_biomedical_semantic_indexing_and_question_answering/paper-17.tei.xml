<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Clinical coding stands for transforming medical information from patient's Electronic Health Records (EHR) into alphanumeric codes using a classification standard <ref type="bibr" coords="1,419.19,441.95,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Nowadays the interpretation of EHRs and the assignation of standardised codes lies on human coders or even on physicians themselves. However, the massive amount medical of data that increases with each patient's visit has become an excessive burden for human annotators <ref type="bibr" coords="1,430.29,482.60,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This led to a rise in demand for development and improvement of the automatic curation systems capable to handle massive amounts of EHRs.</p><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to address the need of managing unstructured data in order to extract relevant information that makes Information Retrieval (IR) more efficient or can serve as input for such application as Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), for example <ref type="bibr" coords="1,129.19,563.89,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Search queries that mention disorders (this refers to diseases, abnormalities, dysfunctions, syndromes, injuries, etc.) constitute the first most frequent non-bibliographic query type among PubMed users <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.30,86.97,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The relevance of this category in clinical texts is also very high, which emphasises the need of creating accurate Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Normalization (NEN) systems to improve information retrieval. This kind of systems would automatically detect disorder mentions in both scientific and clinical texts subsequently mapping them to codes in a relevant controlled vocabulary.</p><p>With Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,409.56,154.71,14.12,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, large pre-trained neural language models of transformer architecture became an essential building block for many NLP tasks, such as text classification, NER, text summarization, etc. Nevertheless, transferlearning capacities of these models depend, among many diverse factors, on the language variety differences between the pre-training corpora and task's data. Considering that the vocabulary and syntax of medical jargon differs from general-domain language, continual pre-training of a general-domain model was proposed as a way of improving its performance in biomedical NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.05,249.56,11.33,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Despite being beneficial, continual pre-training does not extend the vocabulary of the original model, which maintains unrepresentative of domain-specific texts. This fact led to the proposal of domain-specific pre-training from scratch that was proved to be more efficient than continual pre-training <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.68,290.20,11.43,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Disease Text Mining and Indexing Shared Task (DISTEMIST) at CLEF 2022 BioASQ workshop brings the community effort to design systems capable of making disorder mention in clinical text accessible for search systems by identifying them and mapping each one to a code from the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -Clinical Terms (Snomed-CT) <ref type="foot" coords="2,425.67,342.65,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Snomed-CT is a integral multilingual clinical terminology that contains almost 800,000 descriptions, including synonyms that can be used to refer to a concept, that are linked with semantic relationships. Moreover, Snomed-CT is called the most comprehensive clinical healthcare terminology in the world <ref type="foot" coords="2,114.91,396.84,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> .</p><p>In this paper we describe the approach followed by the SINAI team to tackle both NER and NEN DISTEMIST subtasks. The success of biomedical domain-specific pre-training of large transformer language models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.52,439.25,12.83,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> brought us to test two models of the same architecture that were pre-trained on different corpora <ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.13,452.79,12.99,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to evaluate its performance on NER task. For the DISTEMIST-linking sub-task we propose a multi-step approach that combines embedding similarity calculation and term matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>Both DISTEMIST subtasks challenge researchers with real-world datasets, promoting the improvement of the state-of-the-art NLP systems for clinical coding <ref type="bibr" coords="2,372.39,552.07,13.41,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The gold-standard corpus provided by workshop organization committee is a collection of 1,000 clinical cases in Spanish from different medical specialities such as cardiology, oncology, otorhinolaryngology, dentistry, pediatrics, primary care, allergology, radiology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and urology annotated with disease mentions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,238.48,606.27,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>DISTEMIST organizers provided a collection of 750 clinical cases for the NER sub-track, 583 of which formed the training set for the NEN sub-track. This training set was annotated  with 5,348 unique entity mentions and 1,844 unique Snomed-CT codes, being 57 the maximum number of disease annotations per text. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,299.09,392.85,5.06,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows descriptions of the 20 most frequently mentioned entities and Snomed-CT codes in the DISTEMIST corpus. One peculiarity of the provided annotations is the existence of nested disease mentions. With this we refer to complex expressions like "loss of kidney graft from chronic nephropathy" which is a disorder mention that contains another one, namely "chronic nephropathy". In the DISTEMIST Corpus such entities appear as separate annotations and the total count of this mentions is 411. During the pre-processing, we resolve nested disorder mentions in favour of the longest one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entities Tokens Sentences</head><p>The text length measures obtained by tokenizing each text with RoBERTa byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding tokenizer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,202.53,514.80,18.07,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> showed that the longest text contained 1,486 tokens and, most importantly, 248 texts from the training set exceeded the maximum length of input for the RoBERTa model selected as core of our system, which is set to 512. This fact brought us to perform sentence-level NER, thus text pre-processing consisted in splitting the texts in sentences using the SentenceRecognizer from the SpaCy processing pipeline <ref type="foot" coords="3,374.39,567.24,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . SpaCy´s SentenceRecognizer relies on es_core_news_sm pre-trained language model<ref type="foot" coords="3,345.25,580.79,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> which was used to predict whether each token of every text starts a sentence or not. Some basic statistics of the dataset are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,184.82,609.64,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>It is important to mention that we randomly splitted the training set to be able to perform in-house validation during the process of system development. The resulting validation set contained 30% of training data.</p><p>As for the test set, it consisted of 250 additional cases for both sub-tracks, while the predictions were made on a concatenation of test and background sets with the total number 3,000 documents, which also we subjected to the same pre-processing as the training set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">System Description</head><p>In this section, we describe the systems developed for DISTEMIST-entities and DISTEMISTlinking sub-tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sub-task 1</head><p>The DISTEMIST-entities subtrack required automatically finding disease mentions in clinical cases. Taking into account the length of clinical texts in the dataset, as we anticipated in Section 2, we opted for a sentence-level NER approach based on fine-tuning of two pre-trained RoBERTa language models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,166.81,290.16,16.25,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Our first system is based on a fine-tuned biomedical-clinical model <ref type="foot" coords="4,388.20,301.96,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref> , trained on a combination of biomedical and clinical texts that, hypothetically, suits better for the proposed task, due to the particular syntax and vocabulary that clinical texts present, comparing to medical scientific literature.</p><p>The second system developed for NER subtask leveraged medical domain-specific model<ref type="foot" coords="4,501.78,356.15,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> pre-trained on a the medical crawler collection <ref type="bibr" coords="4,306.84,371.46,18.06,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> extended with data from other sources, such as SciELO-Spain-Crawler <ref type="bibr" coords="4,227.95,385.01,17.91,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and other.</p><p>The two models were fine-tuned for the token classification task by adding a linear classifier layer preceded with a 0.1 dropout layer on top of the original architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sub-task 2</head><p>This task aims to assign each mention found in the DISTEMIST-entities track a code from the list of relevant terms from Snomed-CT provided by the competition organizers <ref type="bibr" coords="4,436.18,475.38,16.08,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. To address this, we suggest a three step approach. First, we calculate the embeddings for all the entity spans detected in subtask 1 and for every term in the ontology with RoBERTa models that we fine-tuned for the previous subtask. We achieve this by mean pooling the last hidden state of the model's output. Then, we link each entity to the closest term in the ontology by calculating the cosine similarity between the resulting embeddings. The second step of our approach relies on looking for perfect matches between the mentions found and the ontology terms. In this phase, the system replaces the Snomed-CT codes assigned in the previous step if the mention's string is exactly the same as any ontology's term. 14429 entities, out of which 2618 are unique, have been found in this step. Lastly, we follow the same approach, but in this case we look for direct matches in the training set provided by the organizers where 6246 additional entities are found -633 unique-. Therefore, exact string matching finds 20675 out of the 48699 entities detected in the previous subtask. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,269.36,637.97,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates architecture of the proposed system. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Setup</head><p>All the transformer models were fine-tuned on a single NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU by making use of the Hugging Face's transformers Python library <ref type="bibr" coords="5,334.58,351.85,16.25,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In order to maximize the resulting performance of our systems we carried out a hyperparameter optimization powered by Optuna Framework <ref type="bibr" coords="5,330.73,378.95,16.23,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The cited framework incorporates efficient implementation of both searching and pruning strategies. During the optimization, Optuna infers concurrence relations between the searched parameters to switch from independent sampling to concurrence sampling after few trials. In addition, a pruning algorithm monitors intermediate training results and terminates unpromising trials.</p><p>The hyperparameter space for the optimization was defined as follows:</p><p>• Learning rate: float value between 3𝑒 -5 and 5𝑒 -5 Finally, Table <ref type="table" coords="5,164.74,566.25,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes hyperparameters selected for each model after optimization trials.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,107.28,484.12,3.83,10.91">•</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Metrics selected by DISTEMIST organization team to evaluate system performance on both tracks are micro-average precision (MiP), micro-average recall (MiR) and micro-average F1score (MiF1) -those are very commonly used for text and token classification tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 3</head><p>Official results obtained by the SINAI team in DISTEMIST-entities and DISTEMIST-linking subtasks along with the mean (MEAN) and standard deviation (SD) of all participants' submissions.</p><p>summarises the results obtained by the SINAI team during the official evaluation carried out by the organizers. The evaluation demonstrated that the systems pairs presented on both sub-tracks achieve very similar results despite the fact of being based on two different pre-trained models. Using the biomedical model on EHRs can be considered as cross-domain experiment and the fact that our biomedical system exhibits encouraging results (0.7387 MiF1) on the NER task highlights the existence of domain transfer potential between biomedical and clinical fields. The clinical model also performed well on the first sub-track scoring 0.7367 MiF1 on the test set.</p><p>Regarding the results obtained in the second subtask, our best system achieved a MiP of 0.4163, a MiR of 0.4081, and a MiF1 of 0.4122, all of them being higher than the average scores of all the participants. It is important to note that these results are highly dependent on the ones scored in the NER subtrack since the entities used to assign the normalized codes are the ones detected in that task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Error analysis</head><p>With the objective of forming an opinion about pockets of low performance of our NER system, we conducted an error analysis based on model's performance on custom validation set that consisted in a random 30% split DISTEMIST Corpus, as stated in Section 2. The most frequently observed error type is related to nested entities. The system occasionally either detects a Example 2 of incorrect labelling of a nested entity complex mention and, consequently is not able to recognize one that forms part of it, as shown on Table <ref type="table" coords="7,132.19,351.52,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, or detects only simple mention without returning the nested one, as illustrates Table <ref type="table" coords="7,115.79,365.07,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>In this paper, we present systems developed by the SINAI team for DISTEMIST track at CLEF 2022 BioASQ workshop. This challenge consisted of two sub-tracks: one focused on detection of disease mention in EHRs and the other targeted mapping this mention to codes from the Snomed-CT ontology.</p><p>In order to address these two tasks our team followed an approach that takes as its basis finetuning of two transformer models pre-trained on biomedical and biomedical-clinical corpora. For the DISTEMIST-entities sub-track we fine-tune both models to perform sentence-level NER with a prior hyperparameter optimization step. For the DISTEMIST-linking sub-track we applied several techniques to find the closest term in the Snomed-CT ontology in order to assign a code to each entity.</p><p>The resulting performance of our NER systems revealed the remarkable cross-domain potential that the selected transformer-based model pre-trained on biomedical corpora has when fine-tuned on clinical texts. Our best performing NER system was also made publicly available on HuggingFace Hub<ref type="foot" coords="7,189.20,598.08,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref> . As for the entity linking, calculating embedding distances provided encouraging results for entities that did not appear neither in the ontology nor in the training dataset.</p><p>For future work, we plan to address nested entities issue by testing novel approaches such as Parallel Instance Query Networks (PIQN) <ref type="bibr" coords="8,280.59,86.97,16.41,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Furthermore, a more in-depth error analysis needs to be carried out in order to infer the reasons of false positives and false negatives in the test test predictions and be able to suggest solutions for these problems. With the object of improving entity linking system performance, we plan on improving both matching and semantic similarity calculation. Having in mind that abbreviations and acronyms are commonly used in medical texts <ref type="bibr" coords="8,188.76,154.71,13.00,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> we contemplate including disambiguation of abbreviated terms as a step prior to matching in our processing pipeline. Furthermore, we aim to execute some experiments using Levenshtein distance as the indicator of semantic similarity between text sequences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,213.71,416.69,8.93;3,89.29,225.71,310.83,8.87;3,89.29,84.19,416.68,122.93"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Descriptions of the 20 most frequent entities and Snomed-CT codes in the corpus (English translation of entities and code descriptions made only to ease the reading).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,89.29,84.19,416.68,122.93" type="bitmap" /></figure>
