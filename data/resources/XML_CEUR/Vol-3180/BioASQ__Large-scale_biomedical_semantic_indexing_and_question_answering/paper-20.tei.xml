<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Table Question Answering (TQA) is an important but under-explored task. Most of the existing QA datasets are in unstructured text format and only few of them use tables as the context. To the best of our knowledge, none of TQA datasets exist in the biomedical domain where tables are frequently used to present information. In this paper, we first curate a table question answering dataset, BioTabQA, using 22 templates and the context from a biomedical textbook on differential diagnosis. BioTabQA can not only be used to teach a model how to answer questions from tables but also evaluate how a model generalizes to unseen questions, an important scenario for biomedical applications. To achieve the generalization evaluation, we divide the templates into 17 training and 5 cross-task evaluations. Then, we develop two baselines using single and multi-tasks learning on BioTabQA. Furthermore, we explore instructional learning, a recent technique showing impressive generalizing performance. Experimental results show that our instruction-tuned model outperforms single and multi task baselines on an average by ∼ 23% and ∼ 6% across various evaluation settings, and more importantly, instruction-tuned model outperforms baselines by ∼ 5% on cross-tasks.</p></div>

To this extent, we first curate a table question answering dataset, BioTabQA, using 22 templates without heavy and expensive human annotation. This dataset also serves to evaluate the generalization of a model, a well-known issue that many language models have failed even though they outperform humans in many popular benchmarks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,327.37,583.42,16.56,10.91" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,347.44,583.42,12.42,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>.

Inspired by this, we leverage instruction-tuning to build a model and verify whether instruction learning also show stronger generalization on BioTabQA.</p><p>Our contribution can be summarized as: <ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.79,114.06,11.81,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study biomedical TQA and this is also the first attempt to incorporate instructional learning in this task, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.53,141.16,11.46,10.91" target="#b1">(2)</ref> we reformulate differential diagnosis as a TQA problem and introduce a new dataset BioTabQA, and (3) experimental results show that our instruction-tuned model outperforms single and multi task baselines by 23%, 6%, and outperforms multitask model by 5% in cross-task (generalization to unseen task) setting. Finally, our analysis shows that instruction is more important and useful in cross tasks compared to in-domain tasks in inference time.  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.80,253.99,11.54,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, WikiTableQuestions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.66,267.54,11.31,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Sequential Q&amp;A <ref type="bibr" coords="2,272.31,267.54,11.31,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Spider <ref type="bibr" coords="2,320.76,267.54,16.12,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, WikiSQL <ref type="bibr" coords="2,386.29,267.54,16.12,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. These approaches can handle the large-scale tables from Wikipedia efficiently. However, these QA systems can only answer the question when a strong signal needed for identifying the type of answers is provided explicitly in the table. To overcome this limitation, TabFact <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.09,308.18,17.76,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is proposed which enables TQA when the answer is not explicitly available in the table. However, none of the above datasets are in the biomedical domain, a domain which is not only essential in human life but also in which tables have wide applications (e.g. many biomedical information are presented by tables). There exists some table datasets in biomedical domain, such as PubTabNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,417.57,362.38,16.11,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a medical table datasets which are widely used in information retrieval tasks.

Nevertheless, these are not biomedical TQA dataset, leaving the biomedical TQA as an under-explored task. This work aims to take the first step to Table question answering in biomedical domain, which is known to be different from the general domain <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.40,430.13,16.43,10.91" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.55,430.13,12.32,10.91" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task and Dataset</head><p>Task Formulation Each data point is a tuple &lt;T, Q, A&gt;, where T is a table, Q is a question, and A is the answer to Q in T. In particular, Q exhibits some symptoms/signs and asks about what potential disease it is, e.g., "I have joint pain and swelling on my face, what's wrong with me". A is the corresponding disease (or diagnosis) in T. The task is to predict A given &lt;T, Q&gt; as input.</p><p>Dataset Source We use the medical textbook "Differential Diagnosis in Primary Care" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,476.76,429.84,17.76,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref> as the source of our dataset, which contains information on how to diagnose a patient by observing their disease symptoms. This book is in the tabular format with five columns: (1) diagnosis, (2) key symptoms, (3) key signs<ref type="foot" coords="3,214.44,468.74,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , (4) background, and (5) additional information. We only use the first three columns to create the dataset. We divide the textbook into 513 tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dataset Creation</head><p>To create large scale training/evaluation datasets (i.e., BioTabQA) without laborious human annotation, we design a wide range of templates to semi-automate the process of dataset generation. We use key symptoms and/or key signs of a diagnosis in the question templates, and the diagnosis as the answer. In addition, we design the corresponding prompt to enable instruction learning for each template. In total, we design 22 templates. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,470.07,567.00,5.10,10.91">1</ref> shows four templates as an example and the corresponding prompts (all templates and prompts are given in Appendix A. Specifically, some templates have one, two, three or four symptoms/sign (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,110.54,607.65,11.06,10.91">ID</ref>  Three Splits in BioTabQA For experimental purposes, we created 3 training/testing/crosstask splits of data. Each split includes 17 templates for in-domain training and testing, where there are non-overlap tables for training and testing. The rest 5 templates are used for cross-task evaluation. For each split, the templates are similar to each other in the training set and less similar to the templates in the evaluation set (cross-task setting) to show the generalization capability of a model. The similarity is defined as either the same number of symptoms/signs presented in the templates or similar phrases in the templates. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,399.25,393.36,5.13,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the statistics of Split 1 and other Splits as well as the division of the Splits are given in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments and Results</head><p>From our dataset, each question type (i.e., template) is considered an individual task. Hence, we have 22 different tasks in total. We design two baselines, the single-task model (STM) and the multi-tasks model (MTM). We compare the performance of the instruction-tuned model (In-MTM) with these two baselines on the in-domain test set, cross-task, and robustness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,472.62,506.18,16.30,10.91" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,491.36,506.18,12.23,10.91" target="#b38">39]</ref>. We use DistilBert <ref type="bibr" coords="4,170.53,519.73,18.05,10.91" target="#b39">[40]</ref> as the backbone model for all experiments. Exact Match (EM) score is used as an evaluation metric. Other experimental setup can be found in Appendix B. In the following, we describe the table linearization technique followed by our instructional multi-task learning model. We present the results and analysis at the end of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Table Linearization</head><p>Since input of the language model is text, we need to linearize the table context from BioTabQA. We use a simple yet effective linearization method suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.02,623.66,17.75,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to convert the table context into a string of text. We pre-define the format "Row 1 is: Diagnosis is _, Key symptoms are _, Key signs are _;..., Row N is Diagnosis is _, Key symptoms are X, Key signs are XX".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Instructional Multi-task Learning Model</head><p>Apart from the prompt designed for each template (see §3), one additional example is also given in the instruction. The example consists of a question and the answer without the context table due to the input length restriction of the language model. We also use special words to denote the beginning of the prompt, and question and answer. In particular, the instruction set of {Prompt: p. Question: q. Answer: a}. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Main Results</head><p>We evaluated our proposed model In-MTM in terms of various aspects including in-domain testing, cross-task setting and robustness. All the results are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,464.64,292.75,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. In the following, we present insightful results and findings based on our experiments. The performance of MTM and In-MTM varies for different split since each split consists of different tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finding 1: Multitask Model performs better than Single-task Model</head><p>From Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,499.56,348.61,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we can observe that MTM outperforms STM in majority cases, leading to on an average 14%, 21%, and 18% improvement on split 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Also, we observe that multi-task learning is significantly helpful on the tasks where the training data is less. Hence, we observe tasks 1, 15, and 21 which have only 667 training examples (see results in the first block of Table <ref type="table" coords="5,89.04,416.36,3.65,10.91" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). We can see that the STM model achieve less than 0.60 EM score; while the MTM trained on split 2 achieves at least 0.85 EM score <ref type="foot" coords="5,270.93,428.15,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . For split 1 where the MTM does not train on tasks 1, 15 and 21 tasks, it shows superior performance compared to the STM. This indicates that multi-task learning is effective in a low-resource setting for TQA. Moreover, for tasks 5 and 13 which have more than 10𝑘 instances, the STM can obtain a 0.90 EM score; while the MTM trained on the split 2 achieves similar performance. This finding is aligned with the literature that multitask learning model improves single task learning model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,388.27,497.65,16.43,10.91" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,407.42,497.65,12.55,10.91" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,422.69,497.65,14.03,10.91" target="#b42">43]</ref> Finding 2: Instruction further improve Multi-task learning Model We can observe from Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,120.58,539.96,5.11,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that In-MTM further improves the performance of the MTM, yielding on an average 6%, 6% and 5% improvement on split 1,2, and 3, respectively. These results indicate the use of instructional prompts increases the question-answering performance both consistently and significantly.</p></div>

This is similar to out-of-domain evaluation where a model has not seen such types of questions in the training time, thus the performance on the cross tasks demonstrates the generalization capacity of a model. From the results shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,296.48,524.01,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we have two observations. First, we can see that both MTM and In-MTM show sufficient performance. In split 3, In-MTM achieves average 0.94 EM on in-domain tasks (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,266.01,551.11,4.14,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and average 0.92 EM on cross-tasks (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,487.62,551.11,3.56,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), a marginal drop (∼ 2%). On the same split, MTM achieves the same performance on in-domain tasks and cross-tasks. More importantly, both MTM and In-MTM achieve higher performance than the STM on every task even though the former two models do not train on these tasks. This demonstrates the benefits of multi-task learning. Second, for each Split, In-MTM achieves better performance than MTM on every cross-task. This shows that instruction learning can further improve generalization.  Finding 4: Instruction is more useful in cross tasks compared to in-domain tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task ID</head><p>We evaluate the In-MTM on two cross tasks and in-domain tasks with different types of instructions to analyze the change in model performance. First, we use mismatched instruction, i.e., instruction of one task for other tasks, however, it is still instructive. From Table <ref type="table" coords="7,464.81,576.62,3.71,10.91" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, we can see that model shows similar performance with the mismatch instruction as original instruction on both in-domain and cross tasks. The reason might be that instructions for the different tasks have a set of similar words (see Appendix A), and previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="7,381.43,617.27,16.30,10.91" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,400.40,617.27,13.95,10.91" target="#b44">45]</ref> have shown that the model can perform well if the instructions have similar words. Moreover, we also construct three types of meaningless instructions which does not have any linguistic meaning such as random strings (e.g., 'ashlksadkl'), random words (e.g., 'hello bye you east'), and repeated characters   (e.g., 'AAAAA'). These meaningless instructions hamper the performance of cross tasks more significantly than in-domain tasks. For in-domain tasks, the model is already exposed to the same type of instances at training time, but for cross-task, these unseen tasks heavily rely on the instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="8,160.75,522.42,16.09,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In summary, instructions can be more important and helpful in cross-task settings.  </p></div>

<div><head n="5.">Future Work and Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we take the first step toward studying table question answering in biomedical domain. We firstly create a dataset, BioTabQA, based on templates using a primary care textbook. We then experiment with three models on BioTabQA and find that multi-task learning is better than single task learning especially in low resource scenarios. Furthermore, the instruction learning can significantly improve the model without instructions on both in-domain as well as cross-tasks. This suggest the benefits of instruction learning on table question answering task, and explore the role of instruction learning in other general table question answering datasets is one interesting future work. The questions in current dataset are based on the formal symptoms or signs given in the textbook, which make some questions unnatural. Using more natural terms to generate the question can produce a dataset more close to real-life scenario.</p></div>
