<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Diagnostic Captioning is described as the automatic text generation from a collection of X-RAY images and it can assist inexperienced doctors and radiologists to reduce clinical errors or help experienced professionals to increase their productivity. Therefore, tools that would help doctors and radiologists produce higher quality reports in less time could be of high interest for medical imaging departments, as well as significantly impact deep learning research within the biomedical domain. With our participation in ImageCLEFmedical 2022 Caption evaluation campaign, we have attempted to address both concept detection and caption prediction tasks by developing baselines based on Deep Neural Networks; including image encoders, classifiers and text generators. Our group, NeuralDynamicsLab at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, within the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, ranked 4 th in the former and 5 th in the latter task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of the most exciting technological aspects nowadays is Machine Learning's impressive potential in transforming the world we live in, primarily due to its exciting resurgence through Deep Learning (DL). The increasing size of biomedical data has allowed researchers demonstrate the evolving capabilities of Deep Learning in biomedical applications, through the development of advanced computing and imaging systems in biomedical engineering, machine learning-based biomedical data mining algorithms <ref type="bibr" coords="1,242.95,508.45,12.68,4.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and baselines for Diagnostic Captioning that has recently attracted researchers' attention, towards the goal of reducing the time required by a doctor or radiologist to produce medical texts and the amount of clinical errors, but also increasing the throughput of medical imaging departments <ref type="bibr" coords="1,289.19,549.10,11.43,4.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we attempted to develop Diagnostic Captioning baselines, based on novel Deep Learning approaches, to investigate to what extent deep networks are capable of automatically generating a diagnostic text from a set of medical images and how much their interpretation of medical images can assist doctors and radiologists produce better quality diagnoses; also at an increased throughput <ref type="bibr" coords="2,188.47,117.33,11.50,4.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Towards this objective, the first step is concept detection that boils down to predicting relevant tags for X-RAY images, while the end goal is caption generation. In ImageCLEFmedical 2022 evaluation campaign, we experimented with addressing both concept detection and caption prediction tasks in order to get a quantitative measure of our proposed architectures' performance <ref type="bibr" coords="2,212.20,171.52,11.43,4.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dataset</head><p>In this section, we describe the data provided in ImageCLEFmedical 2022 evaluation campaign. Precisely, we provide details about the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 concept detection and caption prediction datasets that include images from different radiological image modalities but without including imaging modality information.</p><p>The dataset provided for both subtasks of ImageCLEFmedical 2022 evaluation campaign <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.17,284.35,12.81,4.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref> consists of 90920 images that constitute a subset of the extended Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.83,311.44,11.28,4.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, without imaging modality information. As in previous editions, the dataset originates from biomedical articles of the PMC OpenAccess subset. After merging the initially provided train and validation data, we shuffle them after manually setting the seeds to eliminate randomness in consecutive runs while tuning our hyperparameters and then keep 80% as our training set, 10% as our validation set used for hyperparameter tuning and the remaining 10% as our development set used for model selection. Since the dataset is large we perform neither cross-validation nor data-augmentation. We experimented with adding noise to the images, in the form of random rotations and translations, which however did not provide any additional benefit in our baselines' quantitative evaluation.</p><p>Regarding the concept detection subtask, there are 8374 tags of concepts that are assigned to the X-RAY images, while each image in any of the training, validation or development set is assigned 5 tags on average. Regarding the caption prediction subtask, the total number of captions in the training set is 72736, the total number of unique captions is 70879 and the average caption length is 108 words, including 28 unique words. In the validation set the total number of captions is 9092, the total number of unique captions is 8984, the average caption length is 107 words, including 26 unique words. In the development set the total number of captions is 9092, the total number of unique captions is 8977 and the average caption length is 108 words, including 28 unique words. These counts verify that the aforementioned sets are balanced in terms of their statistics.</p><p>"The concepts were generated using a reduced subset of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 2020 AB release, which includes the sections (restriction levels) 0, 1, 2, and 9". <ref type="bibr" coords="2,473.16,582.43,12.84,4.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The UMLS is a set of files and software that collects multiple health and biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems. To improve the feasibility of recognizing concepts from the images, concepts were filtered based on their semantic type and concepts with very low frequency were removed. In each caption, tokens containing numbers and all punctuation were removed, captions were converted to lower-case and lemmatization was applied using spaCy toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.86,663.72,11.43,4.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods and results</head><p>In this section, we describe the core components of the methods utilized to encode the X-RAYs with dense embeddings in our work and explain in detail the baseline networks that we proposed in ImageCLEFmedical 2022 evaluation campaign, in order of performance, for both subtasks that are based on the aforementioned core components that rely on pre-trained architectures, extremely popular in computer vision.</p><p>Precisely, we provide details about the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 concept detection and caption prediction datasets and on how we designed backbone networks as generic image encoders that rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures that are popular for vision tasks on generic images, such as classification and semantic segmentation, while they are shared within all baselines, in both ImageCLEFmedical Caption tasks. Furthermore, we describe the components of each model and give details on the selected hyper-parameters. For all our models, we have set in advance all the random seeds equal to 0, the CUDNNs backends as deterministic and disabled the CUDNNs backends benchmark to ensure consistency of the aforementioned splits in consecutive runs for hyper-parameter selection. This procedure has been applied for both subtasks of the evaluation campaign.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Backbone Networks: image encoders</head><p>One of the principal components in the proposed architectures that is shared for both subtasks includes the image encoders. They constitute existing state-of-the-art architectures, pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="3,238.95,381.06,11.28,4.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which are obtained from torchvision models library to perform inference, while any additional components such as a multi-label classification head or a caption generation architecture are appended to the output of the image encoder; in this content these models are referred to as "backbone networks". The goal of these networks is to encode the images into dense numerical representations. Since Deep Learning became popular and what is called the Deep Learning Community was given birth, different initialization strategies for the weights and the biases were proposed. We used Glorot initialization shown below <ref type="bibr" coords="3,481.81,462.35,12.69,4.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to initialize the weights of the classification heads and experimented with non-pretrained image encoders that we initialized using the same strategy and fully-finetuned them, their performance however was inferior in concept prediction.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,188.02,522.88,219.23,26.12">Glorot: 𝑊 𝑖,𝑗 ∼ 𝒰 (︂ - √︂ 6 𝑓 in + 𝑓 out , √︂ 6 𝑓 in + 𝑓 out )︂</formula><p>Some Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoders that have been attempted to use include variants of AlexNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.88,578.00,11.45,4.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, ResNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,231.17,578.00,11.46,4.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, DenseNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,295.53,578.00,16.28,4.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, VGG <ref type="bibr" coords="3,343.08,578.00,17.93,4.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and EfficientNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,438.73,578.00,16.27,4.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are obtained from torchvision models library as mentioned above. We also experimented with another architectural choice that is Vision Transformers (ViT) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,367.97,605.10,16.25,4.94" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the performance obtained was poor however compared to CNN encoders. That outcome is in line with the observation in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,100.88,632.20,17.90,4.94" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that Vision Transformers and "Hybrid-ViT architectures are inferior to the CNN-based ones". The above summarize the first step in the design of image encoders that is model selection based on their performance on a development set.</p><p>Moreover, model selection shall be followed by a model collaboration design principle, based on ensemble learning. In this case, we have used the aforementioned models as members of the ensemble or weak learners in a pool of encoders trained with different parameter values (e.g. learning rates, decision thresholds for the positive class, number of epochs), as well as based on different architectures, to seek for diversity and exploit the "Wisdom of the crowd" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,455.91,144.43,17.82,4.94" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for the fine-tuned models. In this context, we take into consideration the "votes" of all the different CNNs by averaging their outputs to make decisions on the generated tags or make guesses on the assigned captions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Concept prediction subtask</head><p>As mentioned in section 3.1 "backbone networks" refer to image encoders, which are state-ofthe-art architectures, pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.61,248.21,11.28,4.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, shared for both subtasks. In the case of concept prediction, an additional classification head that is either a Perceptron or a Multi-layered Perceptron was added on top of these "backbone networks" and its weights were initialized using Glorot initialization strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="4,316.94,288.86,11.43,4.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Pre-trained DenseNet161 with fine-tuned classification head, learning rate 10 -3 , Adam optimizer and gradient clipping</head><p>The first two models correspond to a DenseNet161 convolutional network that is pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset and its head is a Perceptron, which is further fine-tuned on the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data using sigmoid activation function in the output units that equal the number of concepts -thus 8374 nodes, a constant learning rate equal to 10 -3 and the negative 𝐹 1 score as a minimization criterion. For each image, we assign it the concepts that have predicted probabilities above 50%, while the tags obtain their numerical IDs in their order of appearance before shuffling them. Furthermore, we clip the gradients computed during training to be in [-1, 1], to increase numerical stability. When performing stochastic or minibatch Gradient Descent, and the loss changes quickly at one direction and slowly at another, Gradient Descent will progress slowly along the shallow dimension and jitter along the steep one. To overcome this issue, we used Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.08,487.09,16.08,4.94" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, so that progress along steep directions is damped and meanwhile progress along flat directions is accelerated. Adam uses exponentially decaying average to discard history but also momentum as an estimate of the first-order gradient. It has bias corrections for first-order and second-order moments and converges rapidly after finding a local convex bowl. If 𝑡 represents the current time step, Adam updates are equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,196.18,573.92,202.41,67.67">w (𝑡+1) = w (𝑡) -𝜖 v (𝑡) 𝛿 + √ r (𝑡) , 𝛿, 𝜖 ∈ R + v (𝑡+1) = 𝜌 1 v (𝑡) + (1 -𝜌 1 )g (𝑡) , 𝜌 1 ∈ R + r (𝑡+1) = 𝜌 2 r (𝑡) + (1 -𝜌 2 ) (︁ g (𝑡) )︁ 2 , 𝜌 2 ∈ R +</formula><p>Our best performing model (with submission ID 181750) is an instance of the aforementioned architecture trained in all the provided data, thus after merging again the training, validation and development sets that are described in section 2 and achieves 𝐹 1 = 0.43601. The next model corresponds to the same network architecture but is trained only in training set (with submission ID 181715) and achieves a score 𝐹 1 = 0.43567. For the latter case, where we have measured performance in all sets, we present plots with the evolution of 𝐹 1 score and accuracy during training in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,202.79,144.43,3.77,4.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a). The next model corresponds to another DenseNet161 convolutional network that is pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset and its head is a Perceptron, which is further fine-tuned on the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data using sigmoid activation function in the output units that equal the number of concepts -thus 8374 nodes, a constant learning rate equal to 5 × 10 -4 and the negative 𝐹 1 score as a minimization criterion. For each image, we assign it the concepts that have predicted probabilities above 50%, while the tags obtain their numerical IDs in their order of appearance before shuffling them. Furthermore, we clip the gradients computed during training to be in [-1, 1], to ensure numerical stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Pre-trained</head><p>In this occasion we have used an improved version of Adam optimizer, called AdamW <ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.85,315.70,16.27,4.94" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, where weight decay is performed only after controlling the parameter-wise step size and thus yields models that generalize much better. Compared to Adam optimizer that we discussed in section 3.2.1, as well as other adaptive gradient algorithms, where the potential benefit of weight decay regularization is limited because "the weights do not decay multiplicatively but by an additive constant factor" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,225.62,383.44,16.09,4.94" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, AdamW optimizer may overcome this issue, while training much faster than stochastic or minibatch Gradient Descent.</p><p>Our model is an instance of the aforementioned network architecture, it is trained only in training set (with submission ID 181753) and achieves a score 𝐹 1 = 0.43558, although we would expect training with AdamW to perform better. Since the gain of re-training the model after merging all the splits is almost negligible, as we already noticed in section 3.2.1, the remaining models are not re-trained in the entire dataset. Once again, we present plots with the evolution of 𝐹 1 score and accuracy in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,245.35,478.29,3.90,4.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Pre-trained DenseNet161 with fine-tuned classification head, learning rate 5 × 10 -4 and Adam optimizer</head><p>The subsequent model is yet another DenseNet161 convolutional network that is pretrained on ImageNet classification dataset and its head is a Perceptron, which is further fine-tuned on the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data using sigmoid activation function in the output units that equal the number of concepts -thus 8374 nodes, a constant learning rate equal to 5 × 10 -4 and the negative 𝐹 1 score as a minimization criterion. For each image, we assign it the concepts that have predicted probabilities above 50%, while the tags obtain their numerical IDs in their order of appearance before shuffling them and train the network using Adam optimizer; as we have excessively described in section 3.2.1.</p><p>Our model is an instance of the aforementioned network architecture (with submission ID 182152) and achieves a score 𝐹 1 = 0.43539, however, in this baseline we omit clipping the gradients, in contrast with the models described above in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Furthermore, as for both previous best-performing models we present plots with the evolution of 𝐹 1 score and accuracy below in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,222.82,117.33,11.07,4.94" target="#fig_1">1(c</ref>). 3. We observe that the classifications heads, which we finetune on ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data, appear to be sufficiently regularized (thus there is no overfitting) and to have used their maximum capacity.</p></div>

We also experimented with using alternative voting policies, such as computing the union or intersection of the assigned tags by each weak learner, where assignments are defined by the predicted probabilities being above 50%, in the pool of finetuned networks, but they performed poorly.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,126.86,535.09,5.04,4.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the architecture of all individual networks in the pool of encoders.

Note that the classification head is always a Perceptron which is further fine-tuned in the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data using sigmoid activation function in the output units that equal the number of concepts. Moreover, when linear decay is applied, the learning rate is updated by: 𝜂 𝑡+1 = 𝜂 0 × 1-𝑡 𝑇 where 𝑡 represents the current time step, 𝑇 the total number of epochs and 𝜂 0 is the learning rate at the beginning of training procedure. The performance of this mixture of experts (with submission ID 182338) equals 𝐹 1 = 0.43496. </p></div>

Consequently, the ensuing three models constitute ensembles that include different architectures within their members, with varying hyperparameter values to encourage diversity of training regimes. During the voting process we average the probabilities computed by the softmax layer of all different week learners before assigning to each image the tags that have average predicted probabilities above 50%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.6.">Fully fine-tuned DenseNet161 with cyclical learning rate and AdamW optimizer</head><p>The succeeding model corresponds to a DenseNet161 convolutional network that is now fullyfinetuned on the ImageCLEFmedical 2022 data using sigmoid activation function in the output units that equal the number of concepts -thus 8374 nodes, scheduled learning rate <ref type="bibr" coords="9,452.67,137.90,17.78,4.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the negative 𝐹 1 score as a minimization criterion. For each image, we assign it the concepts that have predicted probabilities above 50%, while the tags obtain their numerical IDs in their order of appearance before shuffling them.</p><p>One important aspect of minibatch or stochastic gradient descent relates to the choice of the learning rate 𝜂 that controls the size of the update, which will occur to the gradients in every iteration. Constant learning rates have been traditionally used to train Deep Neural Networks based on back-propagation algorithm, although do not guarantee optimal convergence rate according to the Stochastic Approximation Theory <ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.20,246.29,16.09,4.94" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, precisely the network parameters hover around a minimum at an average distance proportional to the learning rate and to a variance that is dependent on the objective function and the exemplar set <ref type="bibr" coords="9,389.46,273.39,16.42,4.94" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. To this end, cyclical learning rates have been proposed as a new method for setting the learning rate by cyclically varying its value between reasonable boundary values, which increases classification accuracy when training CNNs with generic images <ref type="bibr" coords="9,276.67,314.04,16.25,4.94" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. A high value of 𝜂 will make the network make large steps above the minimum of the error function but never converge to it, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,351.79,535.02,15.36,4.94" target="#fig_2">2(a)</ref>. A small value of 𝜂 will delay convergence, preventing the network to find a minimum of the error function if the number of epochs is limited. A cyclical learning rate linearly ranges between two values 𝜂 min and 𝜂 max . One maximization of the learning rate followed by a minimization is called a cycle. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,89.29,589.22,4.19,4.94" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b) hereunder we present an example of cyclical learning rate, where 𝜂 min = 0.01, 𝜂 max = 0.30, 𝑛 𝑠 = 2 and we denote as 2𝑛 𝑠 the time required for a cycle of our learning rate to complete. In our model we set 𝜂 min = 10 -5 , 𝜂 max = 0.1, 𝑛 𝑠 = 4 for the first 80 epochs and then set it to a constant value 𝜂 = 10 -3 for 30 additional epochs.</p><p>This network (with submission ID 182156) achieves a score 𝐹 1 = 0.31687, which is a rather lower score compared to the pre-trained models on ImageNet classification dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="9,446.56,656.96,11.28,4.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, achieving more than 10% higher 𝐹 1 results on the test set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">𝑘-NN image retriever with Retrieval Augmented Generation</head><p>It has been impressive to researchers how nowadays general-purpose sequence-to-sequence models are getting really powerful, they manage to capture the world knowledge in parameters, they achieve strong results on loads of tasks and are applicable for almost everything. However, they often hallucinate, may usually struggle to access, and apply knowledge and are difficult to update. On the other hand, modern Information Retrieval (IR) is great as well, as externally reviewed knowledge can be useful for a huge variety of NLP tasks. Modern IR provides a precise and accurate knowledge access mechanism, it is trivial to update, whereas by "modern" IR we refer to dense retrieval that starts to outperform traditional IR. On the negative side though, it still needs retrieval supervision or heuristics such as BM25, as well as some -task specific-way to integrate into downstream tasks. The goal of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) <ref type="bibr" coords="12,323.65,382.06,16.09,4.94" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which was used as model component, pretrained on Wikipedia with a FAISS index <ref type="bibr" coords="12,283.43,395.60,17.75,4.94" target="#b28">[29]</ref> built on 42% of PubMed 2022 including recent publications related to the fields of neuroscience and computational biology; is to combine the strengths of sequence-to-sequence models and explicit knowledge retrieval. Obviously, RAG is also blended with the 1-NN baseline; namely its outputs are concatenated with the caption of the visually most similar image from the training set to produce caption predictions. This model uses either a pre-trained AlexNet or VGG-16 CNN on ImageNet classification dataset as backbone network and, despite it containing a non-parametric memory, additional to storing information in the parameters of a sequence-to-sequence generative model that is a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) generator <ref type="bibr" coords="12,313.13,504.00,16.39,4.94" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, after merging our training, validation and development sets that are described in section 2 to take advantage of more input-output pairs (𝑥, 𝑡), achieves a lower BLEU score than its predecessors described in 3.4.1 according to Table <ref type="table" coords="12,115.31,544.65,4.97,4.94" target="#tab_6">7</ref> below.
