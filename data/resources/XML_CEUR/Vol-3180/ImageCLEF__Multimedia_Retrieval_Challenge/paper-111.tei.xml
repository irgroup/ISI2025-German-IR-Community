<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>We present the participation experience of the PoliMi-ImageClef group in ImageCLEFmedical Caption task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,148.32,429.07,12.81,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> 1 . The Image Captioning is one of these research tasks, which is composed of two sub-tasks: Concept Detection and Caption Prediction. The Concept Detection task includes developing a multi-label classifier, intended for medical images, by identifying medical concepts. These concepts are assigned in terms of Unified Medical Languages System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.89,469.72,15.35,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> 2 to each image. The Caption Prediction task comprises of generation of captions, which is essential in interpreting the medical images.</p><p>This paper discusses the models that were used in Concept Detection sub-task by PoliMi-ImageClef team. Our best run was ranked 6th in the competition. In this model we used a Resnext-50-32x4d encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="1,211.48,537.47,12.99,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> to acquire image embeddings used for classification. Another model which showed a promising potential in validation phase, used a Swin-Transformer [4] to extract the image features. Combined with a feed-forward neural network, it slightly outperformed the Resnext-50 model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>The dataset provided for ImageCLEFmedical Caption task 2022 is an extended version of Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,305.13,400.51,11.58,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The dataset originates from biomedical articles of the PMC OpenAccess subset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.41,414.06,11.38,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A similar dataset was used for the ImageCLEFmed 2020 concept detection task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,214.78,427.61,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The dataset in comprised of 83,275 radiology images in training set, 7,645 images as the validation set and 7,601 images as the test set. The total number of UMLS concepts present in the dataset is 8,374. The maximum number of concepts present in a single image is 100. In development process, we combined the training set and validation set and spliced it into training set, validation set and test set with (0.6, 0.2, 0.2) ratio. This test set was used to compare the performance of models in development process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>In this section we discuss different method used in development phase. In total we trained and tested 6 models. Some of these models used different encoders such as ResNet-50 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,488.39,581.08,12.99,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , DenseNet-121 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.82,594.63,16.42,10.91" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, Resnext-50 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,231.96,594.63,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, whereas others used variations of Swin-Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.22,594.63,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. All these models were pretrained on ImageNet1k or ImageNet22k <ref type="bibr" coords="2,389.76,608.18,18.07,10.91" target="#b13">[13]</ref> in case of Swin-B <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.22,608.18,11.59,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Following this, we rescaled the images to 224×224 and normalized with the mean and standard deviation of ImageNet(224×224) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,231.55,635.28,16.11,10.91" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. ResNext <ref type="bibr" coords="2,293.71,635.28,12.71,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Swin-Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.76,635.28,12.71,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> models performed remarkably well during the development phase of the model. In the following we discuss the structure of ResNext <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.41,662.38,12.84,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> encoder and Swin-Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,340.53,662.38,12.84,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and their novelties. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common Attributes of training process:</head><p>To avoid repetition, in this section we note common attributes of the training procedure for all models. We tackle this task as a multi-label classification; the target to be classified is an array of labels <ref type="foot" coords="3,350.66,361.23,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> that can be present in each image. This narrows our choice for the choice of activation function <ref type="bibr" coords="3,359.82,376.54,17.82,10.91" target="#b14">[14]</ref> to Sigmoid function for each output layer node. In addition, we need to use Binary Cross-Entropy loss function <ref type="bibr" coords="3,448.52,390.09,17.76,10.91" target="#b15">[15]</ref> to fit the model. To acquire a computationally efficient with fewer parameters, we used Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,417.18,16.25,10.91" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>For each encoder, we experimented with two structures :</p><p>• With no hidden layer.</p><p>• With one hidden layer : with 2048 nodes, ReLU activation function <ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.40,463.17,17.76,10.91" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and Dropout rate of 0.2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,143.44,476.72,16.25,10.91" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Resnext-50-based Classification</head><p>In this model, we used a Resnext-50-32x4d encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="3,326.46,525.84,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a CNN<ref type="foot" coords="3,379.12,524.08,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">4</ref> with 48 layers. A ResNext repeats a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology <ref type="foot" coords="3,501.01,537.63,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">5</ref> . Compared to a ResNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.37,552.94,13.00,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , it exposes a new dimension, cardinality (the size of the set of transformations) C, as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">ResNext building block</head><p>A ResNext Block <ref type="bibr" coords="3,165.15,615.20,12.69,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> is a type of residual block used as part of the ResNext CNN architecture. It uses a "split-transform-merge" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.43,628.75,17.79,10.91" target="#b19">[19]</ref> strategy (branched paths within a single module) similar to an Inception module<ref type="foot" coords="4,181.88,378.45,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,188.74,380.21,16.09,10.91" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, i.e. it aggregates a set of transformations. The effect of this strategy on the performance is further discussed in "Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,172.46,407.31,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In our validation process we experimented with different variations of FFNN for classification task, however the simplest model, with only one hidden layer, had the best performance.</p></div>

It can thus serve as a generalpurpose backbone for feature extraction which can be used for a variety of tasks including Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation and Dense Recognition. The architecture of Swin-Transformer and its differences with respect to previous generation of Vision Transformers, is discussed in detail in "Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,138.18,565.43,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In our development we used an iteration of a Swin-Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="4,388.75,578.98,12.88,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that was pretrained on ImageNet22K <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.73,592.53,16.09,10.91" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. The features extracted from the images were then fed to an FFNN. Thorough experimentation we chose an iteration in which the FFNN had 1 hidden layers. </p></div>

The network is trained on the training set for 5 epochs. We trained two instances of this model with learning rates of 1𝑒 -3 and 1𝑒 -4.</p><p>The model trained with learning 1𝑒 -4 had the best performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ResNet-152 RUNS :</head><p>In this runs we used the ResNet-152 encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="5,405.92,329.43,13.00,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> pretrained on Ima-geNet1K <ref type="bibr" coords="5,129.75,342.98,17.80,10.91" target="#b13">[13]</ref> and with 150 convoltional layers and 58M parameters. The encoder coupled with an FFNN with one hidden layer was trained on training set for 5 epochs. The learning rate for this training procedure was set to 1𝑒 -3 after experimenting.</p></div>
