<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The large amount of content to choose from causes the Information Overload problem for visitors of news websites. Based on the analysis of past usage patterns, recommender systems can make a personalized list of preselected content, alleviating the users of the effort entailed in the process of choosing the content they should consume next and limiting the number of choices they need to make.</p><p>There are various existing recommendation systems and algorithms, both in academia and industry.While recommender systems were used on large ecommerce websites for more than a decade <ref type="bibr" coords="1,328.32,561.47,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, there is still a limited range of generic recommender systems that are deployable with little or no customization. With InBeat, we aim at providing a ready-made and versatile recommender for high-throughput use cases. InBeat provides RESTful services for all inputs and outputs, which streamlines its integration with any Internet-connected application supporting the HTTP protocol.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce the InBeat architecture and algorithms in the context of its participation in the CLEF-NEWSREEL: News Recommendation Evaluation Lab (further only Challenge), which focused on recommending news articles in real-time.In section 2 presents the system architecture and technical solution. Section 3 presents InBeat as a news recommender system in the Challenge's on-line task, including the details on performance. Section 4 presents our attempt at the off-line task. Finally, Section 5 provides a list of other InBeat use cases along with some reflections on the organization of the Challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Technical Solution</head><p>InBeat's was designed for scalability and low utilization of resources per one client. A simplified overview of the technical solution is given in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,452.05,554.56,3.87,8.74">1</ref>. The main entry point is load balancer nginx<ref type="foot" coords="2,304.80,564.94,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">4</ref> , which distributes the workloads across multiple instances of API applications. Nginx is focused on high concurrency, performance and low memory usage. It uses asynchronous event-driven approach and is able to provide high performance under high loads.</p><p>Instances are created with Node.js 5 , which is a platform for building fast and scalable applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, suitable for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. As storage we selected MongoDB<ref type="foot" coords="3,473.36,130.37,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">6</ref> , which met our demands on scalability, performance and high availability. Its key advantage is schema-less design, which allows to use custom set of attributes in an individual use case without the need to update the schema. MongoDB also supports map/reduce procedures that are used for aggregation of data and for providing different views on data by InBeat. We use MongoDB mainly as a storage of historic data (e.g. latest N thousands interactions per news portal or descriptions of items) and aggregated statistics (e.g. number of interactions per item etc.). The Cache is implemented with Redis<ref type="foot" coords="3,346.73,226.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">7</ref> , a highly scalable in-memory, key-value store. It provides essential performance improvement under high workloads, reducing the latency of business logic including storage operations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">On-line task: Setup and Results</head><p>The CLEF-NEWSREEL: News Recommendation Evaluation Lab<ref type="foot" coords="3,427.75,304.40,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">8</ref> is focused on recommending news articles in real-time. The emphasis of the Challenge is on scalability and response time limitation. Recommendations had to be provided in real-time (within 100 ms), and the winning criterion was set to the total number of successful recommendations, rather than the prediction accuracy (clickthrough rate). There are practical problems with real time processing of recommendations that are not incurred when there is "unlimited time" to provide the recommendation. It is necessary to balance the architecture and technologies with the complexity of the involved algorithms. The InBeat platform deals with real time processing of data using special features of NoSQL databases and map/reduce principles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task Definition</head><p>This section describes simplified definition of the news recommender task. Inputs: The main inputs are the users' interactions and news item descriptions.</p><p>interaction(type, userId, itemId, context) where type = {impression|click} and context describes the features of the user (e.g. browser version, geolocation, etc.) and special features related to items and their presentation (e.g. keywords, position). item(itemId, domain, description)</p><p>where domain is the identifier of items from the same group (e.g. news portal) and desciption provides more detailed information about items (e.g. title, text, time of last update). Outputs: Set of recommended items for the specific user who is reading the item within a given context.</p><p>-(userId, itemId, context) → {item x , item y , ...}</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Algorithms</head><p>In this section we describe a set of algorithms we used in the Challenge.</p><p>Top Interacted This algorithm is based on the daily popularity of news items.</p><p>To avoid excessive effect of high short-time popularity of one item the interactions are aggregated on a daily basis. This approach deals with an evolution of popularity over time and decrease an influence of peaks appeared at the specific days. We implemented the algorithm using simple incremental updates in a MongoDB collection represented as a triple (Date, ItemId, count). The result is s list of items sorted by the number of interactions.</p><p>Most Recent Since we are in the highly dynamic news domain, the recency of an article plays an important. Our baseline recency-based algorithm uses a simple heuristic based on the newest news item within the same group as the group of the item the user is reading at the time of the request. The results is ordered list of items sorted by creation time.</p><p>Rule Based Since this algorithm is more complex than the previous one, we decided to describe it in greater detail. For each interaction(type, userId, itemId, context) stored in our database, we prepared one entry in the training dataset as described in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,419.06,484.44,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Interactions are described only by the contextual features that are provided by the platform (e.g. Location, Browser, ...) and by an identifier of item the user interacted with.</p><p>The training dataset was used to learn association rules. The contextual features could appear only in the rule body (antecedent) and the identifier of the item only on the right side of rule (consequent). We used association mining algorithm apriori implemented in R -arules<ref type="foot" coords="4,329.49,554.96,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">9</ref> . Example of a rule: isp = "281" ∧ os = "431229" → item = "1124541" Additional mining setup is as follows. We used latest N thousands interactions as training dataset from our database. We experimentally set N to five thousands. The apriori algorithm is experimentally constrained with minimal support of five interactions, and minimum confidence of 0.2. All discovered rules are imported into our simple rule engine. The engine finds all rules that match the contextual features of a recommendation request. The consequent of each matching rule represents a recommended item. The output is a list of unique item identifiers from the right side of the matching rules.</p><p>The association rule-based algorithm was added at the end of Challenge and thus did not participate in all evaluation weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Performance</head><p>In this section, we present the performance of the InBeat recommender in the Challenge. The metrics used in the Challenge to select the winning recommender systems was the cumulative number of clicks (number of successful recommendations) over the three different evaluation periods. The additional metrics provided by the organizers include number of impressions and click-through rate.</p><p>Sum of the number of impressions with the number of clicks can be interpreted as the performance of the systems -the ability to process large number of interaction on the server.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,180.44,489.03,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the network traffic on our server infrastructure within the last week of the Challenge. During this period, InBeat handled thousands of recommendation requests. The peaks in the graph correspond to the higher number of interaction in daytime. Note that the gap between Monday and Tuesday is caused by the maintenance break of our infrastructure. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,402.27,536.85,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_1">3</ref> depicts the CPU load on the server. The server load was kept mostly under ten percent even in peak periods. InBeat was run on a single virtual machine assigned four Core i7@3.20GHz cores and 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,180.28,585.03,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_2">4</ref> presents the results for the last evaluation period. The table is sorted by the cumulative number of clicks. InBeat team is on the third position. The table provides only results that are aggregated per team participating in the Challenge. There are no specific results for each recommendation algorithm. In click-through rate, the second metric, InBeat is on the fourth position.</p><p>Since the CTR reported in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,305.96,645.16,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_2">4</ref> is the average for all algorithms, also report the numbers for the individual InBeat algorithms:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Off-line task: Setup and Results</head><p>In addition to the on-line challenge CLEF-NEWSREEL offered an off-line task. The dataset consisted of 84 million records of recommendation data across multiple portals <ref type="bibr" coords="6,191.03,576.06,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task definition</head><p>From the off-line dataset, we used a subset of 26,875 records. <ref type="foot" coords="6,404.88,624.81,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_6">10</ref> The data were preprocessed to the form shown at Table <ref type="table" coords="6,324.26,638.34,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref>  The results clearly indicate that while our experimental rule-based system surpassed other symbolic learning algorithms incl. CHAID and Decision Tree, it was not able to beat the SVM with RBF kernel baseline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we introduced the InBeat experimental recommender system. There is an on-going work on extending the set of recommendation algorithms available in InBeat and their customization to the constraints imposed by the Challenge platform, which remains open for further experiments.</p><p>It should be noted that InBeat or its modules are or were deployed also in other use cases. The first version of its component was conceived as a web analytics solution compatible with Google Analytics <ref type="bibr" coords="8,367.11,329.51,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and was deployed on a travel agency website. The option to process web analytics data was extended in the current version with support for the recent version of the Google Analytics tracking code ga.js. InBeat is currently primarily extended as a component of a "SMART-TV" recommender system <ref type="bibr" coords="8,304.39,377.33,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The most recent development in this direction is the ability to process feedback from user-behaviour tracking with Microsoft Kinect <ref type="bibr" coords="8,211.24,401.24,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,224.61,244.75,166.13,7.89;5,136.18,116.83,343.00,113.14"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
