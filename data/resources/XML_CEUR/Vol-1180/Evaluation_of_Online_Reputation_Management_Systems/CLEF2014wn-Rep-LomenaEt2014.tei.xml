<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the participation of UNED in RepLab 2014 where we tackled the author profiling task focused on classifying and ranking Twitter profiles using their tweet streams.</p><p>Twitter constitutes one of the main sources of data relevant for online reputation management because of the spontaneity and immediacy. Although not all the tweets have the same impact. The way in which a post may affect the reputation of a company often depends on who published it. The author profiling task aims at classifying authors by type of their activity and identifying the influential ones, those whose tweets are more likely to propagate quickly and widely through the network and to produce a greater effect. So the final goal is to build a ranking list of the selected Twitter profiles.</p><p>The paper is organised as follows. The applied approach is introduced in Section 2 briefly describing the features considered and the learning process. Sections 3 explains the configurations of the model for author categorisation and author ranking. In Section 4, we report the results obtained for each subtask. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude and outline possible improvements of the system in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Proposed Approach</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Features</head><p>The model uses the following set of features:</p><p>Bag of Words: a feature set based on a Weka filter called StringtoWordVector was built. It contains a vector of occurrences of words in a document. We used the default configuration of this Weka filter.</p><p>This feature is important to determine the most important words which decide the classification of Twitter profiles in the Author Categorisation subtask. This feature could be more discriminant if it is used taking in consideration the domain information to divide the classification algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of sentences:</head><p>The system used GATE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,351.60,214.49,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with the SentenceSplitter resource to get a feature with the number of sentences. We used a specific Sen-tenceSplitter for each language, one for English and other one for Spanish.</p><p>POS information: Seven features were built based on the POS tags. We used the GATE POS Tagger with the OpenNLP framework and different models for each language. Before running the POS tagging, we preprocessed the tweet contents to remove hashtags, mentions, and URLs, using regular expressions. After getting the POS tags, we considered a set of the following features that exploit the number of adverbs, verbs, adjectives, nouns, pronouns, foreign words, and abbreviations. This follows the previous work by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.06,333.90,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[7]</ref> where the number of POS elements were considered for measuring polarity. These features, in our opinion, could characterise the author's writing style and could be useful useful in author categorisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of links:</head><p>We have built a regular expression method to count the number of links in the tweet.</p><p>Similar to the point above, we consider this feature useful for the author categorisation subtask, because it reflects stylistic characteristics of the user's writing.</p><p>Number of hashtags: Following <ref type="bibr" coords="2,278.04,465.12,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.55,465.12,7.01,8.74" target="#b3">4]</ref>, we included a process based on regular expressions to count the number of hashtags.</p><p>The hypothesis is that the number of hashtags could be indicative of the relevancy of a tweet, as the more hashtags there are, the more topics will be involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of mentions:</head><p>Again, based on the work in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.55,536.71,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we included the count the number of explicit mentions of users of the form user.</p><p>For instance, for the following tweet it would be generated the value of 6 mentions for this feature:</p><p>still waiting on @MeganBerry's #fbumpf contribution :) kevinGEEdavis @MerlinUWard @MimiOrtega @jeremarketer @AmyVernon @IAmMrSid Number of smileys: The system considered the number of smileys, based on the experience of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,193.86,644.16,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In order to count smileys, we manually built a dictionary using information extracted from Wikipedia. Buenos días :) A por un fin de semana increíble lleno de color amigs ;) http://ow.ly/i/2EXp7</p><p>Language: We used the language label provided by the Replab 2014 organisers as a feature of the classifier.</p><p>This feature is used mainly to determine the set of words to be considered as Bag Of Words.</p><p>In the unofficial run, we included two new features, based on Twitter metadata. For that, we used Twitter4J, a Java Wrapper for Twitter REST API. We built the following new features: Number of followers: For each profile, we queried Twitter about the number of followers of every profile in the training and test data sets.</p><p>The idea was to use this feature in the Author Ranking substask to generate weight values the application of which is described below.</p><p>Retweet speed: We examined the last retweet of each author. The retweet speed was calculated as follows using the creation date, number of retweets and the creation date of the last retweet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,174.39,354.40,306.20,22.31">avgT ime = (LastRT CreationT ime -T weetCreationT ime) N umberOf RT<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In order to sort elements, we built a weight measure which was calculated using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,238.25,420.15,242.35,22.31">weight = N umberof F ollowers AverageRT speed<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This formula tries to relate the retweet speed with the number of followers. The aim is to capture those cases when, given two profiles, for instance, one with 1,500 followers and the other with 1,600, the former has more activity in terms of tweets propagation and retweet speed than the latter. So the underlying hypothesis is that it is more relevant a profile with a smaller number of followers and higher speed, than a profile with a bigger number of followers and lower speed. One run was configured with this weight parameter. Regarding this feature, the bigger the weight value is, the more important is a profile.</p><p>Due to Rate limiting, we only managed to obtain retweet speed information for about 50% of profiles. In order to use it as a feature, an empty value for the feature was taken to build the classifier for the Author Category subtask. For Author Ranking, an average speed was assigned, multiplied by the number of followers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Learning Process and Confidence Methods</head><p>The learning process of our system is composed of a voting system, a set of classifiers and a method to resolve the ties by means of confidence scores.</p><p>We divided the training data set into 5 subsets, each containing 20% of data. 601 tweets provided by the organisers with each profile were also split in five parts. The classifiers were trained considering each tweet as an instance instead of grouping all the data related to one profile in one instance. Four of the subsets were used to train the system employing the following Weka algorithms:</p><p>-ZeroR Algorithm -RandomTree Algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,258.72,200.61,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> -RandomForests Algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,270.31,212.95,10.96,8.74" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,281.27,212.95,7.31,8.74">6]</ref> -Nave Bayes Algorithm These four algorithms allowed covering 80% of the data set. The remaining 20% was used to create a confidence score table.</p><p>That training set partition had nearly 300,000 tweets. We iterate tweet per tweet and stored (in a relational database) 4 rows per each tweet as confidence information. As result of that we had a table with close to 1,200,000 (per each Replab 2014 subtask) rows to query information about confidence. The following formula was used to solve those cases when at least three classifiers decided the same:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,161.45,361.97,319.14,22.31">conf idence(cat, algs) = alg∈algs nRightClassif ication(cat, alg) nClassif ications(cat, alg)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Where cat is the category for which the confidence value has to be calculated and algs is a set of algorithms the result of which was the category cat. nRighClassif ication is a function with the number of correct classifications for this category produced by this algorithm, and nClassif ications is a function which counts the number of classifications for that category.</p><p>The confidence scores are used to decide which category is more plausible after training. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,229.35,469.18,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> reproduces the architecture of the confidence score component. This figure shows how the confidence scores table is populated with the outcomes of the algorithms, based on the training data.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,181.71,505.43,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates how the confidence score information is used to disambiguate the results and decide which class value should be assigned to a profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Algorithms</head><p>In this section, we describe the algorithm configurations. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,420.65,577.01,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the Author Categorisation algorithms, specifying the kind of data used in each of them. " AC" in the runs identifiers indicates the "Author Categorisation task", while " AR" stands for "Author Ranking".   Basic configuration This is the first and the simplest system configuration (ORM UNED AC 1) for author categorisation that consists only of classification algorithms without taking into account information about the domain. The 4 classifiers were fed with a small set of features which included BoW, POS, hashtags, mentions, links, smileys, and language. The classification result was obtained by applying a basic voting algorithm using majority rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Author Categorisation</head><p>In order to avoid the bias towards the most frequent class (Undecidable), a threshold was applied. The majority class label (Undecidable) was assigned only if it was supported by 80% or more votes. Below that threshold (80%), we classified the profile as another majority class, distinct from Undecidable.</p><p>We used 4 classifiers which classified a profile tweet by tweet. For each profile, we generated 4 class values per tweet, producing near 2400 class values per profile. This information was used to obtain the majority result of the voting algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic configuration with domain features</head><p>This configuration (ORM UNED AC 2) includes information about the profile domain. Algorithms were defined to consider the domain element and decide which algorithm should be used. The same set of features as in the basic configuration, although choosing different classifiers depending on the domain.</p><p>As before, we used a threshold to avoid the bias towards the most frequent class (Undecidable), setting it at the same value. This configuration produced 8 classifiers.</p><p>Confidence scores model This configuration used information about confidence of classifiers algorithms when their results are close to a tie. We submitted the results of this configuration as ORM UNED AC 3.</p><p>The confidence information was used to decide the outcome of the classification. In case of a tie, we calculated confidence scores using the equation 3. We used the same feature set and threshold as in the basic configuration.</p><p>Confidence scores and social information model We built a last configuration using a new kind of information, social information (ORM UNED AC 4) after the official deadline for submitting results. This configuration, for which we can report an unofficial result, is similar to the simple confidence score model described above, but using two new features: number of followers and retweet speed.</p><p>We applied to the annotations with the Undecidable class the same threshold as in the basic configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Author Ranking</head><p>For the Author Ranking subtask, we submitted one official run: ORM UNED AR 3 (see Table <ref type="table" coords="7,182.14,238.33,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The developed algorithm is described below.</p><p>Basic configuration We used the following features:</p><p>-Class value of opinion maker/non opinion maker -Number of followers -Retweet speed</p><p>The weight function defined in Equation 2 was used to sort the ranking results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,162.51,426.75,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports the scores obtained in the author categorisation subtask Average Accuracy and F 1 (R, S). The results of the SVM baseline provided by the organisers are also included for reference. The test set contained three domains. We employed two domains and in order to assign a value to the third class, we selected one of the classifiers built using the training dataset. Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,257.78,620.25,7.75,8.74" target="#tab_2">3,</ref><ref type="table" coords="7,268.64,620.25,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, 5 report the scores obtained for the evaluation metrics used in the author category subtask: Reliability (R), Sensitivity (R) and F 1 (R, S) for each domain. For the automotive and banking domains we also include scores of the baselines for reference. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Author Ranking Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,162.21,138.99,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">6</ref> reports the Average Accuracy obtained in the Author Ranking subtask evaluation, the position in the official RepLab 2014 ranking. For reference, it also includes the baseline provided by the organisers that uses the number of followers. We described the algorithms submitted to the RepLab 2014 Author Profiling task, where we tackled both author categorisation and author ranking.</p><p>Author categorisation was our main focus at RepLab 2014. We submitted three official and one unofficial run. Our proposal was based on a voting system featuring a method to calculate confidence scores to solve ties in votes. However, the results obtained with the confidence method were not as good as we expected, as they were surpassed by the basic configuration. Nevertheless, although the confidence method got the worst results in Average Accuracy, it turned out the best in F-measure not only among our runs, but also considering the rest of the Author Categorisation task participants.</p><p>Future work in author categorisation is going to focus on selecting new features and improving on the whole system in order to make processing more efficient. Furthermore, we will have to refine the confidence formula to avoid setting a threshold for the majority "Undecidable" class.</p><p>Regarding author ranking, the bad results can be partly explained by the lack of information for building the ranking. Due to the Twitter Rate Limit, we failed in getting necessary information about the followers and retweet speed for all the profiles. So in case of profiles without this information, they were assigned an average value. This distortion might have affected the system's outcome.</p><p>For author ranking, future work will focus on getting more information from Twitter, although the first step, of course, will be to improve the query process to cope with the Twitter Rate Limit.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,233.05,366.22,149.25,7.89;5,134.77,151.46,345.85,199.99"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
