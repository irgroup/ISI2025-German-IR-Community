<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In our contribution we use log-analysis to investigate whether participants in the INEX Interactive Social Book Search are able to use the new multi-stage interface and whether it provides any benefits over the traditional IR baseline interface. Our initial results show that participants are able to successfully use the new multi-stage interface, with no significant learning effects. Additionally, for the non-goal task, the multi-stage interface actually enables the participants to collect more books than when using the baseline interface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The CLEF<ref type="foot" coords="1,182.67,418.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> INEX<ref type="foot" coords="1,216.50,418.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> track's Interactive Social Book Search task gathered data from users using one of two interfaces to complete two tasks. The baseline interface implemented a standard Information Retrieval (IR) interface <ref type="bibr" coords="1,423.99,443.49,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> consisting of a search box, a search result list, and an individual item display. The second interface (multi-stage) attempted an implementation of Kuhlthau's multi-stage search process <ref type="bibr" coords="1,193.21,479.36,12.19,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, filtered through Vakkari's simplification of the model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.15,479.36,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Two tasks were tested, the first an non-goal task where participants were asked to look for any book they might find interesting, and a goal-oriented task where participants were asked to find books for a given topic ("laymen books on mathematics and physics"). Each participant completed both tasks in one of the two interfaces. Task order was automatically balanced to avoid ordering bias.</p><p>We investigated the following three research questions:</p><p>1. RQ1: Does the multi-stage interface enable the participants to explore and find a larger number of books? 2. RQ2: Does the multi-stage interface have an additional learning time? 3. RQ3: Do participants make use of all three stages in the multi-stage multistage interface?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Time Spent in the System</head><p>The first analysis focused on how long the participants spent using the system in order to determine whether there were any differences between the two systems and tasks. The experiment system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.04,168.04,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> automatically measured the time taken on the non-goal and goal-oriented tasks for every participant and the main analysis is based on this data. For the three stages implemented in the multi-stage interface, the log data acquired by the IR system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.02,203.90,10.51,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was processed to determine how long each participant spent using the each of the three stages ("explore", "focus", and "refine"). The first step in the analysis was to determine if the task ordering impacted the time spent on either of the tasks. Wilcox signed rank tests were used to compare the task times for all interface and task combinations, showing no significant differences in task duration for any of the combinations. For the multi-stage interface, the time spent in each of the three stages was also compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for both ordering conditions, and also showed no significant differences in times in the two stages. For the remainder of the analysis, the task order can thus be ignored and the times for the two order conditions aggregated.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,178.53,347.86,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the task times for the two interfaces and tasks. The data seems to indicate that participants are faster with the multi-stage interface for both tasks and that within the interfaces, participants are faster to complete the non-goal task than the goal-oriented task. However, for neither of these conditions does a Wilcoxon rank-sum test show significant differences. Thus for the remaining analysis presented here, we can assume that any differences in participant performance are due to the task or interface and not due to the time the participants spent on the task or interface. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Modern Interface Phase Times</head><p>In the multi-stage interface participants were able to switch between three stages ("explore", "focus", and "refine"). Table <ref type="table" coords="2,316.00,632.21,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the time spent in each of the three stages for the two tasks. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test for ordering effects. There are no ordering effects for the time spent in the explore and focus stages, but there is an ordering effect in the refine stage. For the nongoal task, the time spent in the refine stage is longer, if it is the second task (p = 0.012). No ordering effect was shown for the goal-oriented task. The times shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,271.37,278.80,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> follow similar patterns for both the non-goal and closed tasks. Participants spent slightly less than a minute using the explore stage, and then spent between one and a half and two minutes on the focus stage. Only a small fraction of participants used the refine stage at all and those that did, did so only very briefly.</p><p>Considering RQ3, participants obviously do not use the final refine stage, either because they did not notice the stage in the user interface or because the label "Refine" did not clearly state what functionality would be available. Without looking at the participants qualitative responses it is impossible to determine the cause. However, the use pattern for the first two stages is as expected, with participants first spending time in the explore stage gaining an overview and then using the focus stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Books Collected</head><p>To investigate RQ1 we looked at the number of books participants added to their book-bag and also how quickly they added the first book. For RQ2 we also investigated which of the three stages participants added books from.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Total Number of Books Added</head><p>The total number of books each participant added to their book-bag was determine using a manual analysis of the log-data. For the baseline interface, the number of books added to the book-bag was counted and any books that were subsequently removed from the book-bag subtracted from that count. For the multi-stage interface, the same process was applied, but book counts were separated according to which of the stages the books were added from.</p><p>The resulting data-set was checked for task ordering effects using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and no significant ordering effects were found for any of the interface / task combinations. In the multi-stage task, the same checks were applied to the more detailed data and only for the explore stage in the goaloriented task, was there a significant ordering bias. If the goal-oriented task was the second task, then significantly fewer books were added to the book-bag in the explore stage (Wilcoxon signed rank, p = 0.035). As there were no overall ordering effects, the further analysis did not take task ordering into account.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,176.77,154.87,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that significantly more books were added in the non-goal task using the multi-stage interface than using the baseline interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,429.75,166.83,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.011). No such effect is visible in the goal-oriented task. This seems to indicate that the multi-stage interface provides significant benefit to the user when they do not yet have an explicit goal that they are searching for. At the same time, the multi-stage interface does not impact the performance when the user has an explicit goal in mind.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Modern Interface Details</head><p>To investigate RQ1 further we used the dataset from the previous section, but now looked in detail at the number of books added in the three stages of the multi-stage interface (Tab. 4). Task ordering effects were investigated and no significant effects were found. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,177.49,142.98,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> clearly shows that the refine stage was not used to add any books, which is in line with the timing results that showed that the refine stage was essentially not used. Interestingly, although the participants spent more time in the focus stage, they collected more items in the initial explore stage. While the data seems to indicate that in the goal-oriented task participants collected more books in the explore stage, the effect is not significant. goal-oriented 2 (0, 2) 0 (0, 2) 0 (0, 0)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Time to Collect the First Book</head><p>To investigate RQ2, we analysed how quickly participants added their first book in each task. The log was manually analysed and the time between the session start and when the time at which the first book was added to the book-bag determined.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,177.07,426.24,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the median times to collect their first book. While it looks as if the modern interface enables the participant to find the first book faster, the difference is not statistically significant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Interaction Patterns</head><p>The final analysis looked at the interaction patterns, using a user-interaction bi-gram analysis. To create the interaction bi-gram distributions needed for the analysis, the log was processed in the following steps:</p><p>1. Generate interaction string -in the initial step each user-system interaction was mapped to a single letter. Using this mapping, for each participant and each of the participant's tasks a string representation of their interactions with the system was generated. Repeats of a single letter were reduced to a single letter; 2. Create participant pattern distribution -based on the interaction strings, all bi-grams were determined and bi-gram frequency distributions calculated; 3. Aggregate distributions -the participants' bi-gram distributions were aggregated into interface and task bi-gram distributions; 4. Filter distributions -the interface and task bi-gram distributions were filtered. All bi-grams that occurred fewer than three times were aggregated into a single value. This ensures that a potentially large number of interaction patterns that only occurred once or twice do not skew the results, while at the same time not completely loosing that data.</p><p>Before analysing the data in any more depth, potential ordering effects were investigated and only for the goal-oriented task with the multi-stage interface is there a significant difference in the interaction pattern distributions (χ 2 test, p = 0.047). As the significance is border-line and there is no significant differences in any of the other metrics tested, for the purpose of this analysis, the influence of task order will be ignored.</p><p>Comparing the two interfaces shows a significant difference in the bi-gram distributions between the baseline and multi-stage interfaces on the goal-oriented task (χ 2 test, p = 0.036). Looking at the bi-gram distribution (Tab. 6) shows that the main difference is at which point participants added books to their book-bag. In the baseline interface this primarily happened after the participants had viewed the book's detail (IA), while in the multi-stage interface it happens directly from the search results list (QI ). The behaviour after adding an book to the book-bag is also different. In the baseline interface, the next action is to run another query (IQ), while in the multi-stage interface it is to view another book (AI ). Comparing the two tasks within both interfaces, shows a significant difference between the non-goal and goal-oriented tasks in the multi-stage interface (χ 2 , p &lt; 0.001), but none in the baseline interface. From the bi-gram distribution of the multi-stage interface (Tab. 7), three differences stand out. In the goaloriented task, participants made more use of the pagination functionality to see more items (PI ) and also viewed more items after selecting a search facet (FI ). In the non-goal task, participants more frequently viewed different bits of meta-data after viewing an item (MI ). The difference is in line with what would be expected, due to the task differences. In the goal-oriented task, participants use the facetting and pagination functionality to dig into the results, a pattern that is not so relevent when the task is non-goal. At the same time, in the non-goal task, participants interact more with the books' meta-data, as the participants use the meta-data to develop the search goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion the goal of the initial log analysis was to determine how participants used the multi-stage interface. The initial question was whether there would be a learning impact into the participants' peformance. The results clearly show that participants are able to use the new multi-stage interface just as well as the baseline interface and that there are no learning effects. For the non-goal task, the multi-stage interface even outperforms the baseline interface. Clearly, the initial explore stage, designed to support open-ended exploration, enables the user to explore better and thus collect more books.</p><p>Finally, both the considering the number of books collected and the time spent in the three stages of the multi-stage interface, participants clearly only make use of the first two stages. For the first two stages, the behaviour is as expected, with more time spent in the second focus stage, compared to the first explore stage. Interestingly, the majority of books were collected using the first explore stage, a result that needs more analysis. The use of the final refine stage requires further analysis, as it is clearly not used much and the reasons for this need to be investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,134.77,560.91,345.83,7.89;4,134.77,571.90,232.88,7.86;4,216.88,383.34,181.60,162.80"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
