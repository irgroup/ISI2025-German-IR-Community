<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A general overview of our methodology and results for the INEX 2014 Social Book Search Suggestion Task are presented in this paper. This is our first entry in the Social Book Search Track, which started in 2011. Our methodology and experiments are inspired by background research on the Social Book Search Track [5, 6, 7, 8, and 9]. We originally submitted six runs to the INEX 2014 competition and subsequently expanded our experiments as time allowed. Results, though preliminary, indicate some positive directions for future examination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Books have always been prominent sources of information. The Social Book Search Track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,151.49,456.22,11.76,9.07" target="#b1">[2]</ref> was introduced by INEX in 2011 with the purpose of providing support to users in terms of easy search and access to books using metadata. In 2014 the track includes two tasks: the suggestion task and the interactive task. We worked on the suggestion task, which suggests a ranked list of books to satisfy the user's query. The goal is to compare results generated via a traditional system which uses professional and social metadata to that of a recommender system which uses user preference information.</p><p>Much of this year's focus is on the recommender system. With the aim of retrieving more relevant books for a query, we designed a recommender system that uses similar users as its basis for grouping books. The nearest neighbors are used along with the cosine similarity measure to generate a set of similar users associated with each topic. An aspect of particular interest here is the use of both user-generated and professional metadata. The method combines the two aspects of retrieval and recommendation.</p><p>Indexing of documents is done using the search engine Indri <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.46,636.27,15.45,9.07" target="#b8">[11]</ref>, and evaluation measures are calculated using prescribed TREC metrics. The scores obtained from traditional retrieval are further manipulated and re-ranked to produce a new set of recommended scores. These results are again submitted to TREC evaluation and any improvements in the evaluations are recorded. In this paper we provide a brief summary of the methodology followed, the experiments conducted and the results obtained. This paper describes both our traditional and recommender systems in their current state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview</head><p>The Our methodology includes a recommender system that uses user profile content to find users similar to the user who originally posted the query. Once the similar users are found, new, recommender scores are generated by using a linear combination of the traditional score and the recommender-generated score for that query. Based on these scores, the original, ranked list of documents is re-ranked to produce the final set of results. The linear combination used to generate the final scores is based on the parameter Î», which is critical in the re-ranking process. The top 1000 books for each query are retrieved and returned as results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Returning a ranked set of relevant documents in response to a user's query is the goal of the Social Book Search (SBS) Track <ref type="bibr" coords="2,293.49,498.22,10.65,9.07" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The input data set is comprised of 2.8 million documents that contain information from both Amazon [4] and LibraryThing (LT) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.07,522.22,10.74,9.07">[3]</ref>. Each document is in XML format with social, professional and usergenerated metadata. The 680 queries include not only content (i.e., a statement of user need) but also information about the user's catalog. Apart from these two data sets, approximately 94,000 anonymous user profiles are provided to each participating team for experimental purposes (for the recommender system experiments, in particular).</p><p>Our approach combines two methods, namely, retrieval and recommendation. Both are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Traditional System</head><p>The traditional system is responsible for document retrieval, including scrubbing, parsing, and indexing using Indri. Six different indices are generated, based on differ-ent contents from the input XML. These are the social, professional, LT, full, Amazon, and title indices. The queries are also processed based on their XML tags. Each query has four XML tags: title, mediated-query, group, and narrative. We use the following query sets for our experiments: Title (T), Query (Q), Title-Query (TQ), Title-Query-Group (TQG), Title-Query-Narrative (TQN) and Title-Query-Group-Narrative (TQGN).</p><p>We began our experiments by testing our approach and methodology on the 2013 data <ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.80,240.15,11.75,9.07" target="#b0">[1]</ref> which was available to us. Using each index and query set, retrieval was performed both with and without pseudo-relevance feedback <ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.09,252.15,16.79,9.07" target="#b7">[10]</ref> to produce an initial ranked list of documents. Specified numbers of documents and of terms were used to perform pseudo feedback using Indri, with the number of documents, d, ranging from 5 to 15, and the number of terms, t, ranging from 15 to 50. Best results were produced using the full index (as indicated by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,274.29,300.18,11.75,9.07" target="#b5">[8]</ref> for the 2013 data). Using feedback values of d=10 and t=50 with the TQG query set produced the highest nDCG@10 value. We selected this run as the basis for our 2014 submitted runs. That is, the run produced by pseudo-feedback (d=10, t=50) on the full index with the TQG query set is used as our basic retrieval run for INEX submission.</p><p>Upon access to the 2014 QRels, we re-examined our feedback values of d and t with the aim of improving recall. R@1000 improves from 0.328 (at d=10 and t=50) to 0.380 at d=10 and t=15, as seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,332.64,390.20,3.78,9.07" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. We use this retrieval run as the basis for our current results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Recommender System</head><p>This is the second stage of the system, where the results produced by traditional retrieval are re-ranked by the recommender system. The recommender system is designed to make use of information from users "similar to" the user who posted the query. Here we assume that similar users tend to have similar preferences and tastes in books.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Finding Similar Users</head><p>The first step in our recommender system generates a matrix for each of the 680 topic users. These matrices consist of work IDs and tags, because we want to examine and Once the matrices are generated, the next step is to generate a list of similar users based on the context vectors. Pairwise cosine similarity is used as the similarity measure. The top-ranked 50 and 100 "similar users" are considered the sets of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Generating the Contribution of the Recommender System</head><p>We now generate â, the contribution of recommender system, using as input, for each primary user: (1) the rank ordered list of similar users, (2) the similarity score of each such user, (3) the rating for each work ID identified by document retrieval, and (4) the count of similar users having that same work ID in their catalogs. Here we use 2 metrics to calculate â, the contribution of the recommender system. One metric employs a DCG-style metric, and the other uses an MRR approach. These metrics are defined in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,160.56,555.61,3.66,9.07" target="#tab_4">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Generating Final Scores</head><p>A linear combination of the scores produced by traditional retrieval and â, the contribution of the recommender system, produces a re-ranked list of "recommended" documents. By fine tuning Î», we arrive at a value of 0.0000075 for Metric 1 and 0.0000125 for Metric 2. The results obtained by both evaluations are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,150.25,653.55,3.66,9.07" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Analysis and Conclusions</head><p>The best features for the matrices are binary_binary (bin_bin), where both work IDs and tags are represented as binary values. The value of nDCG@10 is greater when 50 rather than 100 similar users are considered. Metric 2 produces a higher nDCG@10 result.</p><p>We note here that many relevant documents are not being retrieved by traditional retrieval. Increasing recall at this stage may be expected to produce improvement in the final scores. Our current best result (0.1058) would rank at 17 in terms of nDCG@10 and 13 in terms of R@1000 when compared to the INEX 14 official results. Many of these results exhibit small differences; we do not yet know if they are significant. This is our first attempt at this task, which has proved to be an excellent learning experience.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="3,129.89,430.21,336.00,8.21"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Results of Traditional Retrieval (Full Index, TQG Query Set with Pseudo-feedback)</figDesc><table /></figure>
