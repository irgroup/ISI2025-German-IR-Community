<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the work that we did at Indian School of Mines towards Social Book Search Track for INEX 2014. We submitted five runs in its Suggestion Task. We investigated individual effect of title, group, mediated query, and narrative fields of the topics in our runs. For all the runs we used language modelling technique with Dirichlet smoothing. The run using only mediated query field was our best. Overall, our performance is not satisfactory. However, as new entrant to the field, our scores are encouraging enough to work for better results in future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With growing numbers of online portals and book catalogues, our current time sees a rapid evolution in the way we acquire, share and use books. In order to enable users, Social Book Seach Track at INEX <ref type="bibr" coords="1,328.57,465.83,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> provides a relevant experimental platform to investigate techniques of searching and navigating professional metadata provided by publishers/booksellers and user-generated content from social media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,163.23,501.70,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. At INEX 2014, they offered two tasks: Suggestion Task and Interactive Task. We participated in the first where we were supposed to recommend books based on user's request and her personal catalogue data (list of books with rating and tags maintained for the user in the social cataloguing site). We were also provided with a large set of anonymised user profiles from LibraryThing forum members. Each user request is provided in the form of topics containing different fields like title, mediated query, group, narrative and catalogue information.</p><p>As a newcomer to this field, our goal this year was to investigate the contribution of different topic fields in book recommendation. We only considered title, mediated query, group, narrative fields from each topic. We did not consider topic-creator's catalogue information. Neither we consulted anonymous user profiles.</p><p>We submitted five runs (run-ids: ISMD-341, ISMD-342, ISMD-350, ISMD-354, ISMD-355) in the Suggestion Task. For all the runs, Language modelling with Dirchlet smoothing was used in Lemur's Indri search system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.45,119.99,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Our overall performance was not satisfactory. The run with only mediated query was best among our submissions.</p><p>Organization of rest of the paper is as follows. We describe our approach in Section 2. Section 3 describes dataset and Section 4 reports results. In Section 5 we analyse our results. Finally, we conclude in Section 5 with directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>This year we took a simple approach similar to standard adhoc retrieval. The document collection provided was stopword-removed and then stemmed using Krovetz stemmer. It was indexed with Lemur Indri search system for all the fields having text within.</p><p>During retrieval, we tried to see the effect of different components of a topic in turn. We therefore used only title (Run-id ISMD-341), only group(Run ISMD-342), only title with stopword removed (Run ISMD-350), only mediated query (Run ISMD-354), and only narrative with stopword removed field (Run ISMD-355) from each topic.</p><p>On top of standard English stopwords we identified a set of a few more like recommendation, hello, suggestion, reference, recent, hi, thank, etc. which we removed in the run ISMD-355.</p><p>We also removed punctuation marks manually from all the textual content of these fields and used only free text queries in all the runs.</p><p>We did not consider any other information like catalogue information and user profile during retrieval.</p><p>For each topic, we submitted 1000 book suggestions in the form of ISBNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Data</head><p>Test collection provided by INEX 2014 SBS orgainzers for Suggestion Task had a document collection and a topicset. The document collection consists of 2.8 million book description with metadata from Amazon and LibraryThing. From Amazon there is formal metadata like booktitle, author, publisher, publication year, library classification codes, Amazon categories and similar product information, as well as user-generated content in the form of user ratings and reviews. From LibraryThing, there are user tags and user-provided metadata on awards, book characters and locations and blurbs. There are additional records from the British Library and the Library of Congress. The entire collection was 7.1 GB in size. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.03,597.34,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> The topic-set contains 681 topics each describing a user's request for suggestion of books. Each topic has a set of fields like title, mediated query, group, narrative and user's personal catalogue at the time of topic creation. The catalogue contains a list of book-entries with information like LibraryThing id of the book, its entry-date, rating and tags.</p><p>The organizers also supplied 94,000 anonymised user profiles from Library-Thing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The scores obtained by our five runs are given in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,385.09,182.16,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The official evaluation measure by INEX'14 is nDCG@10 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,309.29,194.12,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The performance of our runs are in decreasing order. Our best performance is by ISMD-354 where we use only mediated query field. We also show the best score in the task demonstrated by runid USTB-run6.SimQuery1000.rerank all.L2R RandomForest(*), for the sake of comparison. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis</head><p>Although our performance is not up to the mark, there are few take-home lessons.</p><p>As individual fields, mediated query is the most effective, followed by title and narrative. Removing stopwords from the title is actually detrimental (ISMD-341 and ISMD-350). We did not consider any combination of these fields. It would be interesting to see the performance of different combinations of these fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>This year we participated in the Suggestion Task of Social Book Search as initial venture. We tried to see the individual effect of different topic-fields on book recommendation. We considered only a handful of fields like mediated query, title, narrative etc from the topics. While there can be no denial of the fact that our overall performance is dismal, initial results are suggestive as to what should be done next. We need to consult other fields like book catalogue of the topic creators, ratings of the books in the catalogue during retrieval. We also need to take into account profiles of other users. It is also imperative to see the performance of combination of different fields in the topics as well as other fields in user catalogues and user profiles. We shall be exploring some of these tasks in the coming days.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,174.84,272.04,265.66,102.78"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Results -The official evaluation Measure by INEX 2014RUN ID Rank M RR nDCG@10 M AP R@1000</figDesc><table coords="3,201.55,310.15,206.44,64.68"><row><cell cols="2">ISMD-354 22 0.123</cell><cell>0.067</cell><cell>0.049 0.285</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ISMD-341 24 0.106</cell><cell>0.056</cell><cell>0.042 0.236</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ISMD-350 27 0.090</cell><cell>0.048</cell><cell>0.036 0.211</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ISMD-355 29 0.089</cell><cell>0.038</cell><cell>0.026 0.124</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">ISMD-342 32 0.018</cell><cell>0.010</cell><cell>0.007 0.081</cell></row><row><cell>best*</cell><cell>1 0.464</cell><cell>0.303</cell><cell>0.232 0.390</cell></row></table></figure>
