<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Discharge summaries serve a variety of aims, ranging from clinical care to legal purposes. They are also important tools in patient empowerment, but a patient's comprehension of the information is often suboptimal. Continuing in the tradition of focusing on automated approaches to increasing patient comprehension, The CLEFeHealth2014 lab tasked participants to visualize the information in discharge summaries while also providing connections to additional online information. Participants were provided with six cases containing a discharge summary, patient profile and information needs. Of fifty registrations, only the FLPolytech team completed all requirements related to the task. They augmented the discharge summary by linking to external resources, inserting structure related to timing of the information need (past, present future), enriching the content, i.e., with definitions, and providing meta-information, e.g., how to make future appointments. Four panellists evaluated the submission. Overall, they were positive about the enhancements, but all agreed that additional visualization could further improve the provided solution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Discharge summaries transfer information in health care services between working shifts and geographical locations. They are written or dictated by nurses, physicians, radiologists, specialists, therapists, or other clinicians responsible for patient care to describe the course of treatment, the status at release, and care plans. Their primary purpose is to support the care continuum as a handoff note between clinicians, but they also serve legal, financial, and administrative purposes. However, patients, their next-of-kin, and other laypersons are likely to perceive the readability of discharge summaries as poor, in other words, have difficulties in understanding their content (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,238.66,333.22,4.16,11.09" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) [1]. Improving the readability of these summaries can empower patients, providing partial control and mastery over health and care, leading to patients making better health/care decisions, being more independent from health care services, and decreasing the associated costs [2]). Specifically, supportive, patient-friendly, personalized language can help patients have an active role in their health care and make informed decisions. Making the right decisions depends on patients' access to the right information at the right time; therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with personalized and readable information about their health conditions for their empowerment. The overall problem of the CLEFeHealth2013 Task 1: Visual-Interactive Search and Exploration of eHealth Data was to help patients (or their next-of-kin) with these readability issues. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.16,147.89,3.24,7.17" target="#b0">1</ref> The CLEFeHealth2013 Tasks 1-3 developed and evaluated automated approaches for discharge summaries (see Section 2, and Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,396.23,160.22,3.73,11.09" target="#fig_0">1</ref>):</p><p>1. terminology standardization for medical diseases/disorders (e.g., heartburn as opposed to gastroesophageal reflux disease), 2. shorthand expansion (e.g., heartburn as opposed to GERD), and 3. text linkage with further information available on the Internet (e.g., care guidelines for heartburn).</p><p>With the 2014 Task 1, we challenged participants to design interactive visualizations that help patients better understand their discharge summaries and explore additional relevant documents in light of a large document corpus and their various facets in context. As a scenario, assume that an English-speaking, discharged patient (or her next of kin) is in her home in the USA and wants to learn about her clinical treatment history and implications for future behavior, possible symptoms or developments, and situational awareness related to their own health and healthcare in general. That is, targeted users were layperson patients (as opposed to clinical experts).</p><p>We asked participants to design an interactive visual representation of the discharge summary and potentially relevant documents available on the Internet. The goal of this tool was to provide an effective, usable, and trustworthy environment for navigating, exploring, and interpreting both the discharge summary and the Internet documents, as needed to promote understanding and informed decision-making. More precisely, the participants were challenged to provide a prototype that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Although functioning prototypes were preferred, we also accepted paper, mock screenshots or other low-fidelity prototypes.</p><p>We assumed a standard application environment as given, including a networked desktop system and mobile device (e.g., smartphone or tablet). The challenge was structured into two different but connected tasks: ─ 1a: Discharge Resolution Challenge and ─ 1b: Visual Exploration Challenge.</p><p>The participants could choose to work on these tasks separately, or address both together in an integrated task (i.e., Grand Challenge).</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we justify the novelty of our task by reviewing related work and evaluation labs (a.k.a. shared tasks, challenges, or hackathons where participants' goal is to solve the same problem, typically using the same data set) for clinical text processing and information visualization. In Section 3, we introduce our data set and its access policy, detail our challenge, and specify our evaluation process for participant submissions. In Sections 4 and 5 respectively we present and discuss our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we first describe previous evaluation labs for clinical text processing. Then, we continue to justify the novelty of this task by relating the first subsection with related evaluation labs and visual analysis of health-oriented data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Evaluation Labs for Clinical Text Processing</head><p>Language/text technologies to generate, search, and analyze spoken or written natural, human language were already being recognized as ways to automate text analysis in health care in the 1970s [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. However, their development and flow to health care services was -and still is -substantially hindered by the barriers of lack of access to shared data; insufficient common conventions and standards for data, techniques, and evaluations; inabilities to reproduce the results; limited collaboration; and lack of user-centricity [8]. Evaluation labs began addressing these barriers in the early 2000s [9]. The first evaluation labs related to clinical language were in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). <ref type="bibr" coords="4,208.02,356.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b1">2</ref> This on-going series of annual evaluation labs, conferences, and workshops was established in 1992 with its focus on information search. In 2000, the TREC filtering track considered user profiling to filter in only the relevant documents [10]. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,143.82,392.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b2">3</ref> Its data set contained approximately 350,000 abstracts related to biomedical sciences over five years, manually created topics, and a topic set based on the standardized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). In 2003-2007, the TREC genomics track organized annual shared tasks with problems ranging from ad-hoc search to classification, passage retrieval, and entity-based question answering [11]. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,390.18,440.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b3">4</ref> Its data sets originated from biomedical papers and clinical reports. In 2011-2012, the TREC medical records track challenged the participants to develop search engines for identifying patient cohorts from clinical reports for recruitment as populations in comparative effectiveness studies [12]. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,233.70,488.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b4">5</ref> Its data set consisted of de-identified clinical reports, searches that resemble eligibility criteria of clinical studies, and associated relevance assessments.</p><p>In 1997, a Japanese counterpart of TREC, called NII Test Collection for Information Retrieval Systems (NTCIR), was launched. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,333.36,536.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b5">6</ref> In 2013 and 2014, its MedNLP track considered clinical documents (i.e., simulated medical reports in Japanese) [13]. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,143.82,560.87,3.24,7.17" target="#b6">7</ref> Tasks of this track included text de-identification in 2013; complaint/diagnosis extraction in 2013 and 2014; complaint/diagnosis normalization in 2014; and an open challenge, where participants were given the freedom to try to solve any other natural language processing (NLP) task on the clinical data set of the task in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, participant submissions are due by August 1. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,340.20,159.89,3.24,7.17" target="#b7">8</ref> In 2000, the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) began as a European counterpart of TREC. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,244.92,183.89,3.24,7.17" target="#b8">9</ref> In 2005, ImageCLEFmed introduced annual tasks on accessing biomedical images in papers and on the Internet [14]. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,391.20,195.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b9">10</ref> In 2005-2014, it targeted language-independent techniques for annotating images with concepts; multilingual and multimodal (i.e., images and text) information search; and automated form filling related to analyzing computed tomography scans. In 2013, the Question Answering for Machine Reading Evaluation (QA4MRE) track introduced a pilot task on machine reading on biomedical text about Alzheimer's disease and in 2014, QA4MRE organized a task on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering [15]. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,143.82,279.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b10">11</ref> In 2012, CLEFeHealth was created as a new CLEF track dedicated to electronic clinical documents [16]. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,233.94,291.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b11">12</ref> In 2012, it organized a workshop to prepare an evaluation lab and in 2013 and 2014 (called ShARe/CLEF eHealth), it ran both evaluation labs and workshops. The 2013 tasks aimed to improve patients' understanding of their clinical documents and consisted of three tasks: 1) disease/disorder extraction and normalization; 2) abbreviation/acronym normalization; and 3) information search on the Internet to address questions patients may have when reading their clinical records. The tasks used a subset of 300 de-identified clinical reports (i.e., discharge summaries together with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and radiology reports) in English from about 30,000 US intensive care patients and also used approximately one million web documents (predominantly health and medicine sites). In 2014, the data set was similar and the tasks included visual-interactive search and explorationas described in this paper -together with revisions of the 2013 tasks 1 and 3 [17].</p><p>In 2006-2014, the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2B2) considered clinical documents through its following seven evaluation labs [18]: <ref type="bibr" coords="5,430.80,447.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b12">13</ref> text deidentification and identification of smoking status in 2006; recognition of obesity and comorbidities in 2008; medication information extraction in 2009; concept, assertion, and relation recognition in 2010; co-reference analysis in 2011; temporal-relation analysis in 2012; and text de-identification and identification of risk factors for heart disease over time in 2014. Data sets for these labs originated from the USA, were in English, and included approximately 1,500 de-identified, expert-annotated discharge summaries.</p><p>In 2007 and 2011, the Medical NLP Challenges addressed automated diagnosis coding of radiology reports and classifying the emotions found in suicide notes [19]. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,124.68,567.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b13">14</ref> In 2007, its data set included nearly two thousand de-identified radiology reports in English from a US radiology department for children and in 2011, over a thousand suicide notes in English were used.</p><p>In 1998 through 2004, Senseval Workshops promoted system development for word sense disambiguation for thirteen different languages including English, Italian, Basque, Estonian, and Swedish. In 2007, Senseval transitioned to become SemEval shifting the focus on other semantic tasks such as semantic role labeling, information extraction, frame extraction, temporal annotation, etc. while continuing to address multilingual texts. In 2014, SemEval addressed unsupervised learning of disease/disorder annotations from the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 clinical texts including 440 de-identified reports of four types -discharge summaries, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and radiology reports [20]. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,338.34,243.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b14">15</ref> These reports were in English from the US.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Related Evaluation Labs and Visual Analysis of Health-Oriented Data</head><p>As described above, CLEFeHealth2013 is, to the best of our knowledge, the first evaluation lab dedicated to improving patients' understanding of their clinical documents using text processing and visual-interactive techniques. The novelty of the 2014 Task 1 described in this paper lies in combining this timely topic with promising techniques from the field of Information Visualization.</p><p>A number of related research challenges have considered visualization and analysis of health-oriented data before. In 2013, the Health Design Challenge had an evaluation lab aiming to make clinical documents more usable by and meaningful to patients, their families, and others who take care of them. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,358.26,401.87,6.48,7.17" target="#b15">16</ref> This design/visualization task attracted over 230 teams to participate. However, this challenge did not specifically address text documents or their processing. Furthermore, the challenge mainly aimed at static designs, where in context of our challenge, we aim at interactive approaches which allow users to query, navigate and explore the data using visual representations.</p><p>The international VAST Challenge series asks researchers to design and practically apply visual analysis systems that allow analyzing and understanding of large and complex data sets which are provided as part of the challenge definition. Typically, the challenge data contains unrevealed relationships and facts which need to be discovered by the participants, as part of the evaluation approach. The VAST Challenge has previously defined challenge data sets which relate to health-oriented problems. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,464.10,533.87,6.48,7.17" target="#b17">17</ref> Specifically, in the 2011 and 2010 challenges, analysis of epidemic spread scenarios has been proposed. Based on synthetic social media data and hospitalization records, the task was to characterize and identify possible root causes of hypothetical epidemic spreads.</p><p>Research in Information Visualization has previously addressed design of visualinteractive systems to help understand and relate clinical and health record data. One example work is the LifeLines2 system, which allows comparison of categorical events (exemplified on electronic health record data) for ranking, summarizing, and comparing event series [21]. More works, which support analysis and exploration of electronic clinical documents have recently been surveyed in [22]. Many of these works are oriented towards expert use by physicians and clinical researchers, and less for layperson patient use. The latter is the focus of our lab definition.</p><p>A strong recent interest in the research of visualization and visual analysis of health-oriented data is also evident from a number of scientific workshops organized previously in conjunction with the IEEE VIS conference. These include the Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare, which has started in 2011, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,395.34,231.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b19">18</ref> and the Public Health's Wicked Problems: Can InfoVis Save Lives? <ref type="bibr" coords="7,337.02,243.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b20">19</ref> Workshop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Materials and Methods</head><p>In this section, we introduce our data set and its access policy, detail our challenge, and specify our evaluation process for participant submissions. In summary, we used both discharge summaries and relevant Internet documents; participants' task was to design an interactive visual representation of these data; and the evaluation process followed the standard peer-review practice and consisted of optional draft submission in March 2014, followed by final submission two months later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset</head><p>The input data provided to participants consists of six carefully chosen cases from the CLEFeHealth2013 data set [16]. Using the first case was mandatory for all participants and the other five cases were optional.</p><p>Each case consisted of a discharge summary, including the disease/disorder spans marked and mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms, Concept Unique Identifiers (SNOMED-CT), and the shorthand spans marked and mapped to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Each discharge summary was also associated with a profile (e.g., A forty year old woman, who seeks information about her condition for the mandatory case) to describe the patient, a narrative to describe her information need (e.g., description of what type of disease hypothyroidism is), a query to address this information need by searching the Internet documents, and the list of the documents that were judged as relevant to the query. Each query consisted of a description (e.g., What is hypothyreoidism) and title (e.g., Hypothyreoidism).</p><p>To access the data set on the PhysioNetWorks workspaces, the participants had to first register to CLEF2014 and agree to our data use agreement. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,393.48,578.87,6.48,7.17" target="#b21">20</ref> The dataset was accessible to authorized users from December, 2013. Participant access to these documents was facilitated by HS. The data set is to be opened for all registered PhysioNetWorks users in October 2014.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case 1 (mandatory).</head><p>1. Patient profile: This 55-year old woman with a chronic pancreatitis is worried that her condition is getting worse. She wants to know more about jaundice and her condition 2. De-identified discharge summary, including the disease/disorder spans marked and mapped to SNOMED-CT, and the shorthand spans marked and mapped to UMLS (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,157.71,228.21,4.18,11.09">2</ref>) 3. Information need: chronic alcoholic induced pancreatitis and jaundice in connection with it 4. Query (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,187.68,264.22,3.71,11.09">3</ref>): is jaundice an indication that the pancreatitis has advanced    <ref type="bibr" coords="10,238.86,553.85,6.48,7.17" target="#b22">21</ref> that contains intensive care unit data including demographics, billing codes, orders, tests, monitoring device reads, and clinical free-text notes. The data was originally automatically de-identified using de-identification software, all dates were shifted, and realistic surrogates were added for names, geographic locations, medical record numbers, dates, and other identifying information.</p><p>For this task, two authors (HS and DM) independently reviewed the six discharge summaries and manually removed other types of information that could potentially reidentify a patient e.g., the name of a facility the patient was transferred from. We replaced the exact character span of this information with "*"s to ensure the original CLEFeHealth2013 annotation offsets were preserved. We provided our consensus annotations to a MIMIC-II representative for review.</p><p>Query Set. Six real patient queries (i.e. the six cases) generated from the six discharge summaries, a set of in the order of 1 million health-related documents (predominantly health and medicine sites) that the queries can be searched on, and a list of the documents which were judged to be relevant to each of the queries (named result set) were used (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,235.64,238.23,3.60,11.09">3</ref>). This document set originated from the Khresmoi project. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,141.60,249.89,6.48,7.17" target="#b23">22</ref> The queries were manually generated -as a part of the CLEFeHealth2013 Task 3 -by healthcare professionals from a manually extracted set of highlighted disorders from the discharge summaries. A mapping between each query and the associated matching discharge summary (from which the disorder was taken) was provided. We used the TREC format to capture the document title, description, and narrative and supplemented it with the following two fields:</p><p>1. discharge_summary: matching discharge summary, and 2. profile: details about the patient extracted, or inferred, from the discharge summary (which is required for determining the information which is being sought by the patient).</p><p>Document Set. Documents consisted of pages on a broad range of health topics and targeted at both the general public and healthcare professionals. They were made available as DAT files, including the original Internet address (i.e., Uniform Resource Locator called #URL) and the document text called (#CONTENT). For example, for the mandatory query, the folder included 113 files with their size varying from two to eighty kilobytes (1.28 megabytes in total) (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,315.50,456.24,3.61,11.09" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Result Set. The document contents were judged for relevance, using the DAT file names, called document IDs, as a reference. The relevance judgments were performed by medical professionals -as a part of the CLEFeHealth2013 Task 3 -and mapped to a 2-point scale of Irrelevant (0) and Relevant (1). The relevance assessments were provided in a file in the standard TREC format with four columns: the first column refers to the query number, the third column refers to the document ID, and the fourth column indicates if the document is relevant (1) or not relevant (0) to the query. We did not need the second column in this task, so it was always given the value of 0. For example, for the mandatory document, 113 documents were judged, resulting in 26 relevant and 87 irrelevant documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Challenge</head><p>Challenges were deliberatively defined in a creative way and involved visual interactive design and ideally, a combination of automatic, visual and interactive techniques.</p><p>Task 1a: Discharge Resolution Challenge. The goal was to visualize a given discharge summary together with the disorder standardization and shorthand expansion data in an effective and understandable way for laypeople. An interactive visualization was to be designed based on the input discharge summary, including the disorder spans marked and mapped to SNOMED-CT, and the shorthand spans marked and mapped to the UMLS. The design should allow the patient (or his/her next of kin) to perceive the original document together with the appropriate processing (i.e., disorder standardization and shorthand expansion), thereby conveying an informative display of the discharge summary information. Solutions were to include visualizations of the Any duplication or distribution of the information contained herein is strictly prohibited.</p><p>space of processed terms, including their location in the SNOMED-CT/UMLS terminologies. Appropriate interaction methods, including linked navigation and detail on demand, should support navigating the original discharge summary processed terms, and foster the understanding of the record and the trust of the users in the presented information. Although side-by-side linked views of the original discharge summary and the space of processed terms could make up for an effective visualization, participants were encouraged to explore additional views and presentations, including presentation of similarity between terms, identification of multiple abbreviations for a given term, and semantic relationships between abbreviated and nonabbreviated terms.</p><p>Task 1b: Visual Exploration Challenge. Given that discharge summaries had been understood by the patients, the goal then was to explore a space of relevant documents from a large corpus of documents. As a scenario, we assumed a forty year old woman, who seeks information about her condition of hypothyroidism. She wanted to find a document that describes what type of disease hypothyroidism is by using the query: "What is hypothyroidism?" We assumed that a search engine is given and this engine can retrieve and rank the large collection of documents from the Internet. Each document consisted of text and possibly also images and links to other documents. Given this scenario, the goal was to design a visual exploration approach that will provide an effective overview over a larger set of possibly relevant documents to meet the patient's information need. The successful design should include appropriate aggregation of result documents according to categories relevant to the documents, and/or by applying automatic clustering techniques that help to understand the distribution of relevant aspects in the answer set. Basic solutions should support the visual interactive exploration of the top three to twenty relevant documents. However, participants were encouraged to also consider larger result sets in their solutions, supported, for example, by means of visual document navigation or aggregation by appropriate visualization approaches. To that end, the system should include interactive facilities to efficiently change the level of detail by which results are shown and to navigate in the potentially very large space of search results, possibly using concept and/or document hierarchies.</p><p>Grand Challenge: Integrating 1a and 1b. We encouraged interested participants to work on an integrated solution, which addresses both Task 1a and 1b in an integrated approach. A key aspect of an effective integrated solution was the possibility to navigate seamlessly between individual concepts from the discharge summary and explore relevant Internet documents from the perspective of the concepts identified in the reports, by ad-hoc querying for concepts found both in the discharge summary and the currently viewed Internet documents. To that end, participants could (but did not have to) implement their own term expansion and document retrieval algorithms, or reuse results from the 2013 challenge. Ideally, solutions would provide full interactive support for term expansion and document retrieval, possibly also considering uncertainties of the automatic expansion algorithm (if applicable) or user-adaptive functions that assess the relevance of documents. Integrated solutions should also consider the inclusion of external information sources into the exploration process by appropriate navigation and search functionality. Possible sources could include but are not limited to Wikipedia, Flickr, and Youtube.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation</head><p>Participants were given an option to submit to two evaluations via the official Easy-Chair system of the task on the Internet:</p><p>1. By 1 February 2014 (optional, extended to March 1, 2014): drafts for comments.</p><p>Based on this submission, we provided participants comments that may help them to prepare their final submission. We encouraged all participants to submit this draft, but this submission was not mandatory. 2. By 1 May 2014: final submissions to be used to determine the final evaluation results. Final submissions needed to encompass the following mandatory items: (a) a concise report of the design, implementation (if applicable), and application results discussion in form of an extended abstract that highlights the obtained findings, possibly supported by an informal user study or other means of validation and (b) two demonstration videos illustrating the relevant functionality of the functional design or paper prototype in application to the provided task data.</p><p>(i) In the first video, the user should be from the development team (i.e., a person who knows the functionality). (ii) In the second video, the user should be a novice, that is, a person with no previous experience from using the functionality and the video should also explain how the novice was trained to use the functionality.</p><p>Solutions were supposed to address the task problems by appropriate visualinteractive design and need to demonstrate its effectiveness. Participants were encouraged to implement prototypical solutions, but also pure designs without implementation were allowed. Submissions were judged towards their rationale for the design, including selection of appropriate visual interactive data representations and reference to state-of-the-art techniques in information visualization, natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, and document visualization. They had to:</p><p>1. Demonstrate that the posed problems are addressed, in the sense that the layperson patient is helped in their complex information need, 2. Provide a compelling use-case driven discussion of the workflow supported and exemplary results obtained, and 3. Highlight the evaluation approach and obtained findings.</p><p>Each final submission was assessed by a team of four evaluation panelists, supported by an organizer. Primary evaluation criteria included the effectiveness and originality of the presented submissions. By following [23], submissions were judged on usability, visualization, interaction, and aesthetics. Our usability heuristics were:</p><p>1. Minimal Actions: whether the number of steps needed to get to the solution is acceptable, 2. Flexibility: whether there is an easy/obvious way to proceed to the next/other task, and 3. Orientation and Help: ease of undoing actions, going back to main screen and finding help.</p><p>Our visualization heuristics were 1. Information Encoding: whether the necessary/required information is shown, 2. Dataset Reduction: whether the required information is easy to perceive, 3. Recognition rather than Recall: Users should not remember or memorize information to carry out tasks or understand information presented, 4. Spatial Organization: layout, efficient use of space, and 5. Remove the Extraneous: uncluttered display.</p><p>Depending on the field of all submissions, we promised to give recognition to the best submissions along a number of categories. Prospective categories included but were not limited to effective use of visualization, effective use of interaction, effective combination of interactive visualization with computational analysis, solution adapting to different environments (e.g., desktop, mobile/tablet or print for presentation), best use of external information resources (e.g., Wikipedia, Social Media, Flickr, or Youtube), best solutions for Task 1a, 1b, and Grand Challenge, and best integration of external information resources.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Organizers' Comparative Approach</head><p>For comparison purposes, we described organizers' viewpoints of the system design in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="21,168.48,522.30,4.17,11.09" target="#fig_8">8</ref><ref type="figure" coords="21,172.65,522.30,4.17,11.09" target="#fig_9">9</ref><ref type="figure" coords="21,172.65,522.30,4.17,11.09" target="#fig_0">10</ref><ref type="figure" coords="21,172.65,522.30,4.17,11.09" target="#fig_0">11</ref><ref type="figure" coords="21,172.65,522.30,4.17,11.09" target="#fig_0">12</ref><ref type="figure" coords="21,176.82,522.30,8.34,11.09" target="#fig_0">13</ref>. Namely, we developed a digital design (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="21,376.08,522.30,4.19,11.09" target="#fig_8">8</ref>) and printable design (Fig. 9-12). The workflow of producing these contents is described in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="21,439.61,534.30,8.34,11.09" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. Our fundamental principle was to prioritize simplicity. We used WebBook and Web Forager,23 QWiki,24 primary school books, and health pamphlets as our sources of inspiration. Both designs divided a given patient's discharge summary with respect to time to sections for Past, Present, and Future information. The present section consisted of a summary image together with subsections for admission and discharge dates; participating healthcare services and care team members; patient identifiers; history of present illness, and hospital course. The future section had subsections related to the patient discharge together with recommended Internet sites, search phrases, and glossary terms for further information. The past section included all other content of the discharge summary.</p><p>The enriched or altered content was indicated as follows: All expanded shorthand was faded underlined in the digital and printable version (Fig 8 <ref type="figure" coords=""></ref>and<ref type="figure" coords="22,415.18,184.22,7.91,11.09" target="#fig_0">10</ref>). Relevant diseases and disorders were marked as definition hyperlinks in the digital version (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="22,146.53,208.23,4.18,11.09" target="#fig_8">8</ref>) and glossary terms in the printable version (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="22,352.94,208.23,7.91,11.09" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). The recommended internet sites and search phrases originated from the query and result sets (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="22,429.29,220.24,5.01,11.09" target="#fig_8">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="22,454.74,220.24,7.92,11.09" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). We assumed that the healthcare provided gave their patients an access to this electronic and interactive glossary and digital version on the Internet.</p><p>The content was supplemented with a privacy statement, return address for lost pamphlets, and contact details for healthcare services, description of this imaginary hospital's project for making health documents easier to understand for their patients (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="22,146.32,292.26,3.64,11.09" target="#fig_9">9</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Continuing a tradition of evaluation labs that started in the 90s with TREC and since 2000 with CLEF, the CLEF tasks aim to provide a forum where different solutions for the same problem can be compared and contrasted. While the CLEFeHealth2013 task focused on readability, the 2014 Task also delved into the next step: interactive visualization for increasing comprehension of a discharge summary and connecting to additional online information. In this 2014 visualization challenge, 50 teams registered, two teams were granted data access and one team completed the tasks. This team augmented the given discharge information with textual visualization, e.g., adding structure, definitions and links. The panelists who reviewed the submission agreed that more advanced visualization would be beneficial. However, a user study would need to be conducted to verify that such augmentations do not make the material more complex, especially for patients with low health literacy or limited computer skills. A natural first step would be the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed interface changes, e.g. the imposed time structure. For example, such a change could potentially reduce cognitive load in patients upon discharge from the hospital by structuring and managing the acquisition of additional information. More generally, we argue that visual-interactive displays can be very effective tools to help users navigate, explore and relate complex information spaces. Information Visualization to date has researched a variety of techniques, many of which are potentially applicable to tasks in understanding discharge records and related information resources. Respective Information Visualization techniques include, for example, document visualization for over-viewing and navigating document collections, network visualization for communicating relationships between facts and concepts, and time-oriented visualization for understanding developments happening over time. While to date, a number of systems exist for visualization of health records data [22], these often are geared toward expert usage, and we expect further work is needed to enable lay persons to take advantage of the analytic capabilities of such expert systems. We recognize that the defined task was indeed a challenge in that it implied substantial interdisciplinary work: Medical domain data understanding had to be paired with techniques from Information Retrieval, text analysis and interactive data visualization.</p><p>Our task definition also implied work on implementation, application and user evaluation, which in turn require expertise in software engineering and usability studies. Given this indeed challenging task, we are glad to have received one contribution which tackled the posed problems from the perspective of Information Retrieval. We hope that our task definition, the presented data, instantiation and results will foster more interest in the community to work on the problem of visual-interactive access to personal health information by lay persons. We consider this task an important and challenging problem with potentially high benefit for individuals and society alike.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,184.38,610.82,226.42,9.96;2,124.68,452.40,336.66,151.62"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
