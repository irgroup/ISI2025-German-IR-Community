<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper reports on Task 2 of the 2014 ShARe/CLEF eHealth evaluation lab which extended Task 1 of the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth evaluation lab by focusing on template filling of disorder attributes. The task was comprised of two subtasks: attribute normalization (task 2a) and cue identification (task 2b). We instructed participants to develop a system which either kept or updated a default attribute value for each task. Participant systems were evaluated against a blind reference standard of 133 discharge summaries using Accuracy (task 2a) and F-score (task 2b). In total, ten teams participated in task 2a, and three teams in task 2b. For task 2a and 2b, the HITACHI team systems (run 2) had the highest performances, with an overall average average accuracy of 0.868 and F1-score (strict) of 0.676, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, healthcare initiatives such as the United States Meaningful Use <ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.77,591.26,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and European Union Directive 2011/24/EU [2] have created policies and legislation to promote patient involvement and understanding of their personal health information. These policies and legislation have encouraged health care DLM, SV, WWC led the task, WWC, SV, DLM, NE, SP, and GS defined the task, SV, DLM, BRS, LC, and DM processed and distributed the dataset, and SV, DLM, and DM led result evaluations organizations to provide patients open access to their medical records and advocate for more patient-friendly technologies. Patient-friendly technologies that could help patients understand their personal health information, e.g., clinical reports, include providing links for unfamiliar terms to patient-friendly websites and generating patient summaries that use consumer-friendly terms and simplified syntactic constructions. These summaries could also limit the semantic content to the most salient events such as active disorder mentions and their related discharge instructions. Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help by filtering non-active disorder mentions using their semantic attributes e.g., negated symptoms (negation) or uncertain diagnoses (certainty) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.34,226.59,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[3]</ref> and by identifying the discharge instructions using text segmentation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.32,238.55,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.51,238.55,7.01,8.74" target="#b3">5]</ref>.</p><p>In previous years, several NLP shared tasks have addressed related semantic information extraction tasks such as automatically identifying conceptsproblems, treatments, and tests -and their related attributes (2010 i2B2/VA Challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,181.16,286.99,10.79,8.74" target="#b4">[6]</ref>) as well as identifying temporal relationships between these clinical events (2012 i2B2/VA Challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,305.88,298.94,10.30,8.74" target="#b5">[7]</ref>). The release of these semanticallyannotated datasets to the NLP community is important for promoting the development and evaluation of automated NLP tools. Such tools can identify, extract, filter and generate information from clinical reports that assist patients and their families in understanding the patient's health status and their continued care. The ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2014 shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,372.20,358.72,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[8]</ref> focused on facilitating understanding of information in narrative clinical reports, such as discharge summaries, by visualizing and interactively searching previous eHealth data (Task 1) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,394.59,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, identifying and normalizing disorder attributes (Task 2), and retrieving documents from the health and medicine websites for addressing questions monoand multi-lingual patients may have about the disease/disorders in the clinical notes (Task 3) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.75,430.45,14.61,8.74" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. In this paper, we discuss Task 2: disorder template filling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>We describe the ShARe annotation schema, the dataset, and the evaluation methods used for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab Task 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">ShARe Annotation Schema</head><p>As part of the ongoing Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) project <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.17,560.48,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, disorder annotations consisting of disorder mention span offsets, their SNOMED CT codes, and their contextual attributes were generated for community distribution. For 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge Task 1[12] the disorder mention span offsets and SNOMED CT codes were released. For 2014 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge Task 2, we released the disorder templates with 10 attributes that represent a disorder's contextual description in a report including Negation Indicator, Subject Class, Uncertainty Indicator, Course Class, Severity Class, Conditional Class, Generic Class, Body Location, DocTime Class, and Temporal Expression. Each attribute contained two types of annotation values: normalization and cue detection value. For instance, if a disorder is negated e.g., "denies nausea", the Negation Indicator attribute would represent nausea with a normalization value: yes indicating the presence of a negation cue and cue value: start span-end span for denies. All attributes contained a slot for a cue value with the exception of the DocTime Class. Each note was annotated by two professional coders trained for this task, followed by an open adjudication step.</p><p>From the ShARe guidelines <ref type="bibr" coords="3,263.98,204.99,16.25,8.74" target="#b10">[13]</ref>, each disorder mention contained an attribute cue as a text span representing a non-default normalization value (*default normalization value) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,207.22,228.90,11.87,8.74" target="#b6">[8]</ref>: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,149.71,255.08,45.25,8.77">Negation</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Dataset</head><p>At the time of the challenge, the ShARe dataset consisted of 433 de-identified clinical reports sampled from over 30,000 ICU patients stored in the MIMIC (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care) II database <ref type="bibr" coords="4,442.02,249.64,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[14]</ref>. The initial development set contained 300 documents of 4 clinical report typesdischarge summaries, radiology, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms. The unseen test set contained 133 documents of only discharge summaries. Participants were required to participate in Task 2a and had the option to participate in Task 2b.</p><p>For Task 2a and 2b, the dataset contained templates in a "|" delimited format with: a) the disorder CUI assigned to the template as well as the character boundary of the named entity, and b) the default values for each of the 10 attributes of the disorder. Each template contained the following format In this example, the Subject Class cue span is not annotated in ShARe since *patient is an attribute default.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Participant Recruitment and Registration</head><p>We recruited participants using listservs such as AMIA NLP Working Group, AISWorld, BioNLP, TREC, CLEF, Corpora, NTCIR, and Health Informatics World. Although the ShARe dataset is de-identified, it contains sensitive, patient information. After registration for task 2 through the CLEF Evaluation Lab, each participant completed the following data access procedure, which included (1) a CITI <ref type="bibr" coords="5,182.71,334.98,15.50,8.74">[15]</ref> or NIH <ref type="bibr" coords="5,234.27,334.98,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[16]</ref> Training certificate in Human Subjects Research, (2) registration on the Physionet.org site <ref type="bibr" coords="5,299.08,346.94,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[17]</ref>, (3) signing a Data Use Agreement to access the MIMIC II data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>For Tasks 2a and 2b, we determined system performance by comparing participating system outputs against reference standard annotations. We evaluated overall system performance and performance for each attribute type e.g., Negation Indicator.</p><p>Task 2a: Normalization Since we defined all possible normalized values for each attribute, we calculated system performance using Accuracy as Accuracy = count of correct normalized values divided by total count of disorder templates.</p><p>Task 2b: Cue Detection Since the number of strings not annotated as attribute cues (i.e., true negatives (TN)) is very large, we followed <ref type="bibr" coords="5,425.83,537.82,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[18]</ref> in calculating F1-score as a surrogate for kappa. F1-score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision, calculated from true positive, false positive, and false negative annotations, which were calculated as follows:</p><p>true positive (TP) = the annotation cue span from the participating system overlapped with the annotation cue span from the reference standard false positive (FP) = an annotation cue span from the participating system did not exist in the reference standard annotations false negative (FN) = an annotation cue span from the reference standard did not exist in the participating system annotations </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>Participating teams included between 1-4 people and competed from Canada (team GRIUM), France (team LIMSI), Germany (teams HPI and DFKI-Medical), India (teams RelAgent and HITACHI), Japan (team HITACHI), Portugal (team UEvora), Taiwan (team ASNLP), Vietnam (team HCMUS) and USA (team CORAL). Participants represented academic and industrial institutions including LIMSI-CNRS, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Heidelberg, Academia Sinica, DIRO, University of Science, RelAgent Tech Pvt Ltd, University of Evora, Hitachi, International Institute of Information Technology, and German Research Center for AI (DFKI). In total, ten teams submitted systems for Task 2a. Four teams submitted two runs. For Task 2b, three teams submitted systems, one of them submitted two runs.</p></div>

For the individual attributes, team HITACHI had the highest performance for Negation Indicator (0.969), Uncertainty Indicator (0.960), Course Class (0.971), Severity Class (0.982), Conditional Class (0.978), Body Location (0.797) and DocTime Class (0.328), Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,204.93,198.29,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="7,234.90,198.29,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. The HCMUS team had the highest performance for the attribute Subject Class (0.995), and three teams (HPI, RelAgent, Coral) had the highest performance for the attribute Temporal Expression (0.864). For the attribute Generic Class, most teams correctly predicted no change in the normalization value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">System Performance on Task 2b</head><p>For Task 2b, the HITACHI team system (run 2) had the highest performance, with an overall average F1-score (strict) of 0.676 (Table <ref type="table" coords="7,376.83,307.06,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">4</ref>). Team HITACHI also had the highest performance (strict) for the individual attributes Negation Indicator (0.913), Uncertainty Indicator (0.9561), Course Class (0.645), Severity Class (0.847), Conditional Class (0.638), Generic Class (0.225) and Body Location (0.854). The HCMUS team had the highest performance for the attribute Subject Class (0.857), and Temporal Expression (0.287).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>We released an extended ShARe corpus through Task 2 of the ShARe/CLEFeHealth Evaluation Lab. This corpus contains disease/disorder templates with ten semantic attributes. In the evaluation lab, we evaluated systems on the task of normalizing semantic attribute values overall and by attribute type (Task 2a), as well as on the task of assigning attribute cue slot values (Task 2b). This is a unique clinical NLP challenge -no previous challenge has targeted such rich semantic annotations. Results show that high overall average accuracy can be achieved by NLP systems on the task of normalizing semantic attribute values, but that performance levels differ greatly between individual attribute types, which was also reflected in the results for cue slot prediction (Task 2b). This corpus and the participating team system results are an important contribution to the research community and the focus on rich semantic information is unprecedented. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,444.54,369.19,18.27,8.74;4,149.71,393.10,227.65,8.74;4,134.77,405.06,239.95,8.74;4,134.77,417.01,249.50,8.74;4,134.77,428.97,206.62,8.74;4,149.71,452.88,330.89,8.74;4,134.77,464.84,345.84,8.74;4,134.77,476.79,185.51,8.74;4,149.71,500.70,321.08,8.74;4,134.77,512.66,184.09,8.74;4,134.77,524.61,205.20,8.74;4,134.77,536.57,176.84,8.74;4,149.71,560.48,330.89,8.74;4,134.77,572.43,345.83,8.74;4,134.77,584.36,54.62,8.77;4,149.71,608.30,321.08,8.74;4,134.77,620.25,184.09,8.74;4,134.77,632.21,211.79,8.74;4,134.77,644.13,184.20,8.77;5,149.71,118.99,330.90,8.74;5,134.77,130.92,345.83,8.77;5,149.71,154.86,321.08,8.74;5,134.77,166.81,184.09,8.74;5,134.77,178.77,201.52,8.74;5,134.77,190.72,167.48,8.74"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[12]: DD DocName|DD Spans|DD CUI|Norm NI|Cue NI| Norm SC|Cue SC|Norm UI|Cue UI|Norm CC|Cue CC| Norm SV|Cue SV|Norm CO|Cue CO|Norm GC|Cue GC| Norm BL|Cue BL|Norm DT|Norm TE|Cue TE For example, the following sentence, "The patient has an extensive thyroid history.", was represented to participants with the following disorder template with default normalization and cue values: 09388-093839-DISCHARGE SUMMARY.txt|30-36|C0040128|*no|*NULL| patient|*NULL|*no|*NULL|*false|*NULL| unmarked|*NULL|*false|*NULL|*false|*NULL| NULL|*NULL|*Unknown|*None|*NULL For Task 2a: Normalization, participants were asked to either keep or update the normalization values for each attribute.
