<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present the POMELO system developed for participating in the task 2 of the QALD-4 challenge. For translating natural language questions in SPARQL queries we exploit Natural Language Processing methods, semantic resources and RDF triples description. We designed a four-step method which pre-processes the question, performs an abstraction of the question, then builds a representation of the SPARQL query and finally generates the query.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Biomedical knowledge is disseminated in knowledge bases which become increasingly available on the Web. These knowledge bases usually focus on a given type of information: chemical, pharmacological and target information on drugs in Drugbank <ref type="bibr" coords="1,180.97,507.56,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov <ref type="foot" coords="1,355.05,505.99,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">5</ref> , drugs and their side effects in Sider <ref type="bibr" coords="1,170.53,519.52,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, etc. The connection of such life-science knowledge bases is crucial for obtaining more global and comprehensive view on the links that may exist between different biomedical components, factors and actors. Moreover, this allows inducing and producing new knowledge from the already available data. Particularly, the creation of fine-grained links between the existing knowledge bases related to drugs is a great challenge that is being addressed by the project Linked Open Drug Data (LODD) for instance <ref type="foot" coords="1,300.97,589.68,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">6</ref> . In this project, the knowledge recorded in the knowledge bases and dataset interlinks is represented as RDF triples, on the basis of which the linked data can then be queried through a SPARQL endpoint. However, typical users of this knowledge, such as physicians, life-science researchers or even patients, cannot manage the syntactic and semantic requirements of the SPARQL language neither can they manage the structure of various knowledge bases. This situation impedes the efficient use of knowledge bases and the retrieval of useful information. Therefore, it is important to design friendly interfaces that mediate the technical and semantic complexity of the task and provide simple approaches for querying the knowledge bases.</p><p>For instance, it has been shown that for querying the knowledge bases and the Semantic Web data, the use of full and standard sentences is preferred to the use of keywords, menus or graphs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.50,214.96,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. While this study is conducted on general knowledge data, we assume this observation is also relevant for the users of biomedical knowledge bases. Up to now the design of friendly user interface is mainly addressed for general knowledge bases <ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.79,250.82,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.21,250.82,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We can also mention another work which aim is to translate medical questions issued from a journal into SPARQL queries <ref type="bibr" coords="2,231.85,274.73,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In relation with such research problems, the Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-4) campaign proposes a task dedicated to the retrieval of precise biomedical information in linked knowledge bases according to questions in natural language. We present in this paper the methodology we propose to translate natural language questions in SPARQL queries and the system we developed for our participation to the challenge.</p><p>We start with the definitions of the main terms used in the proposed presentation (Sect. 2). Then, we describe the semantic resources available and developed for enriching the questions (Sect. 3). The methodology and the system are described in Sect. 4. The evaluation of the system on the QALD-4 queries is presented in Sect. 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Terminology</head><p>The main terms are used with the following meaning:</p><p>Question The questions are the natural language expressions uttered by human users in order to formulate their information need. Query The queries respect the SPARQL syntax and semantics. They are created automatically on the basis of (natural language) questions. Semantic type Semantic types are indicative of the word meaning. The semantic types are defined from URI prefixes such as disease for rickets, drug for Cetuximab, etc. Frame Frames are defined as linguistic representations of RDF schema. Usually the frames contain one predicate and at least two elements with associated semantic types. Linguistic annotation The linguistic annotations are obtained with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and provide lemma, part-of-speech categories, and terms. Semantic annotation Semantic annotations are obtained by tagging questions with semantic resources.</p><p>The main challenge of the proposed work is to design the optimal methodology for an easy and reproducible rewriting of (natural language) questions in SPARQL queries.</p><p>3 Definition of the Semantic Resources Some resources used are provided by the challenge organizers (Sect. 3.1), others are collected and built specifically for the challenge (Sect. 3.2) to support the method. We use these resources for rewriting the questions in queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Resources Provided by the QALD Challenge</head><p>Three datasets are provided by the QALD challenge:</p><p>-Drugbank<ref type="foot" coords="3,195.04,288.52,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">7</ref> is dedicated to drugs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,299.34,290.10,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It merges chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical information from other available knowledge bases. We exploited the documentation<ref type="foot" coords="3,277.13,312.44,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">8</ref> of this resource to define rewriting rules and regular expressions in our named entity recognizer. -Diseasome<ref type="foot" coords="3,197.06,336.24,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">9</ref> is dedicated to diseases and genes linked among them by known disorder/gene associations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,268.03,349.77,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It provides a single framework with all known phenotypes and disease gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. We exploited the RDF triples and the documentation of the resource to define the rewriting rules. -Sider<ref type="foot" coords="3,173.87,395.91,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_5">10</ref> is dedicated to adverse drug effects <ref type="bibr" coords="3,346.73,397.48,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. It contains information on marketed medicines and their recorded adverse drug reactions. The information is extracted from public documents and package inserts. The available information includes side effect frequency, drug and side effect classifications as well as links to other information, for example drug-target relations.</p><p>The content of each resource is provided in a specific format: RDF triples subject predicate object, so that they encode the useful and usable frame elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Resources Collected and Built for the QALD Challenge</head><p>On the basis of the RDF triples, we build frames from the RDF schema where the RDF predicate is the frame predicate, and subject and object of the RDF triples are the core frame elements. This also includes the OWL sameAs triples. Several types of frame entities are isolated:</p><p>-As indicated, subject, object and predicate become semantic entities. They may occur in questions: in this way, the frames are the main resource for rewriting questions in queries.</p><p>-The vocabulary specific to questions is also built. It covers for instance aggregation operators, negation and types of questions. -RDF literals, issued from named entity recognizer or term extractor, complete the resources. The RDF literals are detected with specifically designed automata that may rely on the source knowledge base documentation.</p><p>These entities are associated with the expected semantic type, which allows creating the queries and rewriting the RDF triples in the SPARQL queries. In that respect, we can consider IRI, strings, common datatype or regular expressions when literals are expected.</p><p>Most of the entities are considered and processed through their semantic type, although some ambiguous entities (e.g. interaction or class) are considered atomically. For these, the rewriting rules will be applied contextually to generate the semantic entities corresponding to the frames (see Sect. 4.2). When using the queries, the semantic types are variables and are used for connecting the edges of queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Description</head><p>We design a four-step process based on NLP methods, semantic resources and RDF triple description (see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,277.46,360.41,3.87,8.74">1</ref>):</p><p>1. We pre-process the questions in order to enrich them with linguistic and semantic information (Sect. 4.1). 2. We perform a question abstraction (Sect. 4.2). 3. We use the abstracted question to construct the corresponding SPARQL query representation (Sect. 4.3); 4. We generate the SPARQL query (Sect. 4.4).</p><p>The process is implemented as a module within the NLP platform Ogmios <ref type="bibr" coords="4,463.33,458.50,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-processing</head><p>The pre-processing of the questions is the same for the training and test sets. The annotation of the questions consists in recognition of numerical values (such as numbers and solubility values), word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization of the words with TreeTagger <ref type="bibr" coords="4,327.26,543.15,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Then, we apply the TermTagger Perl module<ref type="foot" coords="4,186.85,553.54,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_6">11</ref> for identifying semantic entities, i.e. terms with associated semantic types. TermTagger exploits the semantic resources (see Sect. 3) to recognize semantic entities such as disease names, side effects, etc.</p><p>However, as we realized during our preliminary experiments on the training set, the coverage of the terminological entities that appear in questions is not sufficient. We also apply the term extractor Y A T E A<ref type="foot" coords="4,352.89,613.31,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_7">12</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,364.25,614.89,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to improve the coverage of our method. The term extractor performs shallow parsing of the POS-tagged and lemmatized text by chunking it according to syntactic frontiers (pronouns, conjugated verbs, typographic marks, etc.) in order to identify noun phrases. Then, parsing patterns<ref type="foot" coords="6,233.89,141.33,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_8">13</ref> that take into account the morpho-syntactic variation, are recursively applied and provide parsed terminological entities, usually noun phrases relevant for the targeted domain. Each term is represented as a syntactic tree, and sub-terms are also considered as terms in the current configuration. No semantic types are associated to the terms extracted by Y A T E A.

For instance, the semantic entity interaction has to be rewritten in interactionDrug1 if its context contains mention of drug, but it has to be rewritten in foodInteraction if its context contains a term with the semantic type food. On the whole, we defined 44 contextual rewriting rules based on the vocabulary used in the questions and on the documentation of knowledge bases, mainly the one from Drugbank<ref type="foot" coords="7,469.38,117.42,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_9">14</ref> . Besides the rewriting rules, additional disambiguation of the annotations is also performed during the query construction step when the arguments of the predicate are connected by selecting the correct semantic types.</p><p>For performing the abstraction of questions, we identify information related to the query structure:</p><p>1. Definition of the Result form: the question is scanned for identifying words expressing the negation, e.g. no, and its scope, the aggregation operation on the results, e.g. number for count, mean for avg or higher for max, and specific result form such as boolean queries (ASK). The information concerning the presence of the negation and aggregation operators or of specific result form is recorded in data structures to be used at the end of the query construction step or during the query generation step. 2. Identification of the Question topic: we consider the first semantic entity with a given expected semantic type to be the question topic. The expected semantic types are those provided by the RDF subjects and objects in the Drugbank, Diseasome and Sider. information will be used during the query construction step. 3. Identification of Predicate and Argument: according to our internal framebased representation of the three resources, the potential predicates, subjects and objects are identified among the semantic entities and described into a symbol table.<ref type="foot" coords="7,210.16,378.59,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_10">15</ref> At this step, the subjects and objects are fully described in the symbol table. Concerning the predicates, only the semantic types of their arguments are instantiated in the symbol table within the RDF schema. The subjects and objects can be URI, RDF typed literals (numerical values or strings) and extracted terms (these are considered as elements of regular expressions).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,181.15,461.93,4.98,8.74">3</ref> presents the abstraction of the question 22 of the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Query Construction</head><p>The objective of the query construction step is to connect previously identified elements and to build the SPARQL graph pattern (introduced by the keyword WHERE). Thus, the symbols of the predicate arguments are instantiated by either URI associated with the subjects and objects, variables, numerical values or strings.</p><p>For each question, we perform several connections: 1. The question topic is connected to the predicate(s). A variable is associated with the question topic and the predicate arguments that matched the semantic type of the question topic. Note that at the end of this stage, the question topic may remain non-associated with any predicate; 2. The predicate arguments are connected to the subjects and objects identified during the question abstraction: they concern elements referring to URI; 3. The predicates are connected between them through their subjects and objects. The connection between two predicates is then represented by a variable; 4. The predicates from different datasets are connected. We use the sameAs description to identify URI referring to the same element. New variables are defined to connect two predicates; 5. The remaining question topic is connected to arguments of the sameAs predicate; 6. The arguments are connected to the string type to extracted terms annotated in the question. We assume these arguments will be related to the string matching operator REGEX. Thus, terms are considered as string expressions.</p><p>At this point, the predicate arguments which remain unassociated are replaced by new variables in order to avoid empty literals. Finally, the negation operator is processed: the predicates are marked as negated and the arguments within the negation scope are included in a new predicate rdf:type if required.</p><p>At this stage, the question is fully translated into data structures representing the SPARQL query. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,294.35,505.05,4.98,8.74">4</ref> illustrates the construction of the query corresponding to the question 22 of the test set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Query Generation</head><p>This final step aims at generating the SPARQL query string based on the data structures built during the query construction step. The output of this step is the string corresponding to the SPARQL query. It is composed of two parts:</p><p>1. The generation of the result form which takes into account the expected type of the result form (ASK or SELECT), the presence of aggregation operators and the variable associated to the question topic; 2. The generation of the graph pattern. Basically, the part of the query generation consists in generating the strings representing each RDF triple and filter if predicates are negated. But when aggregation operators are used, we also need to recursively generate sub-queries computing the subsets of expressions, before their aggregation.</p><p>The SPARQL queries have been submitted without retrieving the answers. We let this task to the evaluation tool. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,344.27,287.59,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_3">5</ref> presents the generated query which corresponds to the question 22 of the test set.</p><p>SELECT DISTINCT ?v0 WHERE { ?v0 &lt;http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/state&gt; "Gas". } </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>The automatically generated SPARQL queries are evaluated with the online evaluation tool<ref type="foot" coords="9,199.90,487.76,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_11">16</ref> . The answer of each query q is compared with the gold standard. The evaluation measures (F-measure, precision and recall) are computed. The system results are evaluated with macro-measures. The challenge provides 25 questions for the training and 25 questions for the test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Global Results</head><p>In Tab. 1, we present the overall results on the training and test sets. Our system was ranked 2nd out of 3 submissions. We can observe that our results are similar for these two sets of queries (training and test sets).</p><p>We can observe that in both cases, for 19 questions, the system exactly provides the expected answers. For 4 questions from the training set and 3 questions from the test set, we obtain partial answers. In the training set, 2 questions receive no answer while in the test set, we have 3 such questions. Error Analysis To our opinion, the reference SPARQL query for the question 19 of the training set is not correct: the expected result of the question is a list of drugs, while the reference SPARQL query returns a list of diseases. On the test set, we can propose two observations on the limitations of our system:</p><p>-In question 1,<ref type="foot" coords="10,212.70,251.21,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_12">17</ref> the contextual rewriting rules cannot be correctly applied because the semantic entity (gene ... associated) is discontinued; -In question 18,<ref type="foot" coords="10,216.64,274.56,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_13">18</ref> the system correctly detects the semantic entities and the predicates, including the sameAs predicate. The remaining problem is that the system assumes that the sameAs predicate is reflexive while in the resources provided, the instances of this predicate do not encode the reflexivity of the relation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">System Performance</head><p>We analyzed the system performance on a standard computer (2.7GHz dual-core CPU and 4 Gb of memory). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,285.66,616.20,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_4">6</ref> presents the running time for each query ac-cording to the pre-processing sub-steps (named entity recognition, word and sentence segmentation, POS tagging, semantic entity tagging and term extraction) and the question translation into SPARQL queries (Question2SPARQLQuery). Most of the processing time is dedicated to the TermTagger which aims at recognizing the semantic entities. With the internal Ogmios processing (i.e. mainly the input/output), each question is processed in 1.94 seconds on the average on the training set and 1.97 seconds on the average on the test set.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,181.59,206.29,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows the overall system performance according to the number of questions to process. The time needed for processing all the questions is higher on the test set. The variation of running time between processing one question and the whole set of questions is less than one second on the training set and a little more than one second on the test set. We assume the difference is due to the higher complexity of the questions in the test set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a four-step process based on Natural Language Processing methods, semantic resources and RDF triples description. The system achieves good performance with 0.85 F-measure on the test set of 25 questions. It is ranked 2nd out of 3 submissions. Further work includes optimization of the running time for the question processing and the extension of the SPARQL syntax by taking into account the operators on collections of sets. We also plan to investigate the integration of other biomedical resources such as Dailymed or RxNorm, and the use of the developped system for the text mining applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,142.81,554.01,342.37,7.81;5,142.81,564.88,70.10,7.78;5,134.77,562.13,345.81,7.89;5,134.77,573.11,70.80,7.86"><head>Fig. 1 . 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
