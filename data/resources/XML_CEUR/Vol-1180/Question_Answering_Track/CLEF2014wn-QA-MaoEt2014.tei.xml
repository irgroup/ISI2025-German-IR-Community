<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we report our participation in the 2014 BioASQ challenge tasks on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. For the biomedical semantic indexing task (Task 2a) where participating teams are provided with PubMed articles and asked to return relevant MeSH terms, we built on our previous learning-to-rank framework with a special focus on systematically incorporating results of complementary methods for improved performance. For the question answering task (Task 2b) where teams are provided with natural language questions and asked to return responses in the format of documents, snippets, concepts and RDF triplets (Phase A) and direct answers (Phase B), we relied on PubMed search engines and our state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools such as DNorm and tmVar in Phases A and B, respectively. The official challenge results demonstrate that we consistently performed better than the baseline approaches for Task 2a and Task 2b (Phase B), and ranked among the top tier systems in the 2014 challenge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, a number of community-wide challenge evaluations have been held for various research topics in the biomedical natural language processing (Bi-oNLP) field, such as document retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,295.09,563.35,10.79,8.64" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,309.63,563.35,7.19,8.64" target="#b1">2]</ref>, named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" coords="1,433.97,563.35,7.48,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,441.46,563.35,3.74,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.20,563.35,7.48,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, information extraction <ref type="bibr" coords="1,211.50,575.35,10.79,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,225.68,575.35,7.19,8.64" target="#b6">7]</ref>, etc. Different from other challenges such as BioCreative <ref type="bibr" coords="1,125.38,587.35,10.79,8.64" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,139.86,587.35,7.19,8.64" target="#b8">9]</ref>, the BioASQ Challenge (http://www.bioasq.org/) is a newly organized shared task and has a unique focus on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering.</p><p>Similar to the previous year <ref type="bibr" coords="1,242.96,623.35,15.30,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, the BioASQ 2014 challenge consists of two tasks: automated semantic (MeSH) indexing (Task 2a) and question answering (Task 2b). More specifically, for Task 2a, participating teams are provided with a set of newly published articles in PubMed, and are asked to automatically predict the most relevant MeSH terms for each article in the given set. For evaluation, team prediction results will be compared to those gold standard curated by human indexers. MeSH indexing is an important task for the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) because indexed MeSH terms can then be used implicitly or explicitly for searching the biomedical literature in PubMed <ref type="bibr" coords="2,214.01,175.27,15.30,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Indexed MeSH terms can also play a role in many other scientific investigations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.59,187.27,12.83,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.42,187.27,4.28,8.64" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.69,187.27,12.83,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in the biomedical informatics research.</p><p>However, like many other curation tasks, manual MeSH indexing is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As shown in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,268.47,223.27,15.79,8.64" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.53,223.27,11.84,8.64" target="#b15">16]</ref>, it can take weeks or even months for an article to be manually indexed with relevant MeSH terms after it first enters PubMed.</p><p>In response, many automated systems for assisting MeSH indexing have been proposed in the past <ref type="bibr" coords="2,198.87,259.27,12.17,8.64" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.04,259.27,4.06,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.10,259.27,12.17,8.64" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Some automated systems such as the NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) and its newer version, Medical Text Indexer First Line (MTIFL) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,452.12,271.27,15.30,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, are already being used in the NLM production pipelines to assist human annotators with indexing MeSH main headings, and main heading/subheading pairs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,418.66,295.27,15.30,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Task2b is a biomedical question-answering task. For this task, teams are provided with 100 natural language questions in each batch (5 test batches in total) and asked to return answers in two phases. In Phase A, the participating teams should return relevant documents, concepts, RDF triples and snippets for each question. In Phase B, the teams should return "exact" and "ideal" answers. Exact answers depend on the question type, which can be categorized as below:</p><p>• Yes/no type questions: answer either yes or no • Factoid type questions: answer named entities • List type questions: answer list of named entities • Summary type questions: no exact answer is needed Ideal answers are paragraph-sized summaries that are required for all four types of questions. For both phases of Task 2, the question type is known to the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Task 2a</head><p>For Task 2a, our overall approach builds on our previous research where we first proposed to reformulate the MeSH prediction task as a ranking problem in 2010 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.94,573.19,15.52,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: our approach first retrieves an initial list of MeSH terms as candidates for each target article. Next, we apply a learning-to-rank algorithm to re-rank the candidate MeSH terms based on the learned associations between the document text and each candidate MeSH term. More specifically, each main heading (MH) candidate can be represented as a feature vector as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,247.56,630.85,73.13,11.69">x i = (x 1 i ,x 2 i , …,x m i )</formula><p>, where m is the number of features (e.g. neighborhood features, unigram/bigram features, etc). The learning objective is to find a ranking function f(x) which can assign a score to each main heading based on the feature vector and subsequently use the scores to rank relevant main headings of the target document ahead of those irrelevant ones. Finally, we prune the ranked list and return a number of top candidates as the final system output.</p><p>Through participation in the indexing task in BioASQ 2013 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,382.52,187.27,15.30,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we have shown several useful extensions such as using a different learning-to-rank algorithm with an enriched set of learning features, as well as using different methods for list-pruning and selecting top candidates from the ranked list.</p><p>In BioASQ 2014, we further expanded our approach in the following aspects: First, we built binary SVM classifiers using bag-of-word features, one for each MeSH term, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.75,271.27,15.30,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Second, predicted MeSH terms from the aforementioned binary classifiers and NLM's MTI system were added to our list of candidate MeSH terms, in addition to those already collected from the neighbor documents. Third, we limited the neighbor documents to newly indexed articles (last five years) and used a more recent and larger training set, along with a new list-pruning method for selecting final terms from our ranked list. Lastly, we used some post-processing techniques, such as using string matching to identify "Age Check Tags" in the abstract, to enhance the final system output. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,233.93,355.27,4.92,8.64">1</ref> shows a detailed list of key differences between our current system and our 2013 system. In addition to the abovementioned differences, the table also includes a few other notable modifications such as upgrading our lexicon to MeSH 2014 version.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,150.48,414.46,3.36,7.80">1</ref>. Major Differences between our current work and our previous approach in BioASQ 2013 (In both cases, the general learning-to-rank framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,344.55,424.54,14.95,7.80" target="#b15">[16]</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,249.08,611.57,199.20,35.57">) 1 /( / 1 α + + &lt; + i i S S i i S i is the score of predicted MeSH Term at position i λ ⋅ ⋅ &lt; + ) log( 1 i S S i i</formula><p>S i is the score of predicted MeSH Term at position i.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Task 2b -Phase A</head><p>For returning relevant documents, we used search functions. Given a search query, PubMed provides users with two results-ranking options: by date or by relevance. Furthermore, we computed cosine similarity (Eq.1) scores between the question (q) and each sentence (s) in a retrieved article. The sentence in the abstract with the highest score would be returned as a snippet. We did not use full text in this work.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,216.42,241.06,163.77,25.68">cos(𝑞, 𝑠) = 𝑞•𝑠 𝑞 𝑠 = 𝑞 𝑡 •𝑠 𝑡 𝑡∈𝑞∩𝑠 𝑞 𝑡 2 𝑠 𝑡 2 (1)</formula><p>For concept recognition, we used a dictionary-look up method to mine disease, chemical and GO terms and used our previous developed gene normalization tool, Gen-Norm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,151.92,295.51,15.30,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, to identify gene/protein mentions. In addition, we used MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="4,443.64,295.51,16.61,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to extract MeSH concepts from the questions. For snippets, we only return results when the relevant concepts are gene/proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Task 2b -Phase B</head><p>In phase B, the gold-standard relevant documents, concepts, snippets and RDF triples in Phase A become available to the participants. In particular, we used the relevant documents and snippets for returning "exact" answers in Phase B.</p><p>"Exact" answers: For "yes/no" type questions, we simply returned "yes" as "exact" answers because of its strong performance on the previous training data. No "exact" answers were needed for summary-type questions.</p><p>For Factoid and List-type questions, we developed a three-step approach for returning "exact" answers. The first step was to automatically determine the type of desired answers: 1) numbers; 2) multiple choices; and 3) bio-concepts. (See examples in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,142.22,501.43,3.60,8.64" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). If bio-concepts are desired, we further classified them into sub-types: 3a) Gene/proteins; 3b) Chemical/drugs; 3c) Disorder/syndromes; 3d) Mutation/variations and 3e) Species/viruses. Based on such a strategy and previous year's data, we developed a set of regular expression patterns to identify different answer types and subtypes for a given question. When no match is found, the question will be discarded from further processing (i.e. no "exact" answers will be returned). Otherwise, it will be passed to the next step.</p><p>The next step was to generate candidate answers for different answer types in Factoid and List-type questions. For 1), we identified all numbers in relevant snippets to be candidate answers. For 2), the candidates were mined from the questions. For 3) we applied our PubTator <ref type="bibr" coords="4,219.72,633.43,12.83,8.64" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,232.55,633.43,4.28,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,236.82,633.43,12.83,8.64" target="#b26">[26]</ref> tool to the relevant documents for obtaining entity recognition results when generating the candidate answers. PubTator is equipped with several competition-wining text-mining algorithms for automatically extracting bioconcepts (GenNorm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,210.33,669.43,16.61,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for genes, tmChem <ref type="bibr" coords="4,311.66,669.43,11.61,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for chemicals, DNorm for <ref type="bibr" coords="4,436.30,669.43,16.61,8.64" target="#b27">[27]</ref> diseases, SR4GN <ref type="bibr" coords="4,185.65,681.43,16.61,8.64" target="#b28">[28]</ref> for species, and tmVar <ref type="bibr" coords="4,297.84,681.43,16.61,8.64" target="#b29">[29]</ref> for mutations) from free text. The last step was to rank the candidate answers. For each candidate, we calculated its cosine similarity score against the relevant snippets, and ranked the candidates by the similarity scores. We then returned the maximum number of allowed answers (e.g., no more than 5 answers for Factoid-type questions).</p><p>"Ideal" answers: For returning "ideal" answers, we used the same method as retrieving relevant snippets in Phase A. That is, we scored each gold-standard snippet against the question using cosine similarity and returned the one with the highest score. This method is applied to all questions regardless of their types.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task 2a</head><p>Task 2a was organized for three consecutive periods (batches) of five weeks each. Each week, participants have a limited response time (less than one day) to return their predicted MeSH terms for a set of newly indexed articles in PubMed.</p><p>For Task 2a, team results were evaluated based on multiple measures. Two main measures are: the flat measure "label-based micro F-measure (MiF)" and the hierarchical measure "Lowest Common Ancestor F-measure (LCA-F)" <ref type="bibr" coords="5,389.47,557.83,15.30,8.64" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,150.39,582.46,4.44,7.80" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows our best results on the Task 2a Batch 3 Week 2 test set, which contains the largest number of test articles (5,717) with known answers among all 15 test sets of Task 2a, as of June 30, 2014. In this run, we incorporated both MTI and binary classifier results, and applied all three post-processing methods in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,416.15,617.83,3.72,8.64">1</ref>.</p><p>According to the official website, we rank the first in both the flat (MiF) and hierarchical F-measure (LCA-F) on this test set. We also obtained the highest recall scores in both flat and hierarchical measures (MiR and LCA-R). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task 2b -Phase A</head><p>The test dataset of Task 2b was released in five batches<ref type="foot" coords="6,370.18,285.49,3.24,5.69" target="#foot_0">1</ref> over a period of three months, each containing 100 questions. Several measures were used to evaluate team submissions. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,205.33,311.83,4.92,8.64" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows our submission for the final batch (fifth batch) according to the official results released on June 30, 2014, where we obtained the best Fmeasure and mean precision for returning relevant concepts (highlighted in bold). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Task 2b -Phase B</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,150.67,494.47,4.92,8.64" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows our official results<ref type="foot" coords="6,259.06,492.13,3.24,5.69" target="#foot_1">2</ref> for all the five batches, for three types of questions: Yes/No, Factoid, and List. When considering the official measures -accuracy for Yes/No type questions; mean reciprocal rank (MRR) for Factoid type questions; and mean F-measure for List type questions -we achieved consistently better results than the two BioASQ baseline approaches. In addition, we obtained the highest results for the Yes/No-type questions in Batches 1 &amp; 5, and for the Factoid-type questions in Batches 3 &amp; 5 (highlighted in bold in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,302.31,566.47,3.60,8.64" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Note that there are no official evaluation results for our submissions for the Factoidtype questions in Batch 2 and List-type questions in Batches 4 and 5. This is likely due to a data format issue in our submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion &amp; Conclusion</head><p>In BioASQ 2014 challenge on automated MeSH indexing, our learning-to-rank based approach shows improved and competitive performance among all participating systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our learning-to-rank method is a general and robust framework that allows systematic integration of results from other methods for improved performance. When we include predicted results from a knowledge-based approach (MTI) and a text classification method, we were able to achieve the highest recall results by both flat and hierarchical measures while still maintaining high precisions. For instance, compared to one of the baseline systems -MTI First Line -we were able to achieve a much higher recall (59% vs. 49%) with almost the same level of precision (62%) (See Table <ref type="table" coords="7,248.41,474.31,4.92,8.64" target="#tab_1">2</ref> for details).</p><p>Our best results for Task 2b are noted in the "exact" answers to the Factoid-type questions (see Table <ref type="table" coords="7,193.93,510.31,4.14,8.64" target="#tab_4">5</ref>) where we used results of our previously developed named entity recognition (NER) tools. In fact, this approach appears to perform better than relying on the gold-standard concepts from Phase A based on our comparative analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, we participated in both tasks of the BioASQ 2014 challenge where we are ranked among one of the top teams for both tasks. In the future, we are interested in exploring the opportunities of our high-performing MeSH prediction methods in practical applications (e.g. support instant MeSH indexing) and the roles of our stateof-the-art automated entity recognition tools in question answering tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,128.87,424.54,340.13,220.20"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>was used)</figDesc><table coords="3,128.87,440.62,340.13,204.12"><row><cell>Notable Differences</cell><cell>BioASQ 2013</cell><cell>BioASQ 2014</cell></row><row><cell>Learning-to-rank algorithm</cell><cell>MART</cell><cell>LAMBDA-MART</cell></row><row><cell>Neighbor documents</cell><cell>Retrieved from all MEDLINE database</cell><cell>Retrieved from documents indexed after 2009</cell></row><row><cell>The list of candidate MeSH terms</cell><cell>All MeSH terms in neighbor documents</cell><cell>All MeSH terms in neighbor documents plus MTI and binary classifier results</cell></row><row><cell>Features used in the learn-ing-to-rank algorithm</cell><cell>All features in [16] plus a new feature representing the MTI results.</cell><cell>All features in [16] plus two new features representing the MTI and binary classifier results</cell></row><row><cell>MeSH version</cell><cell>MeSH 2013</cell><cell>MeSH 2014</cell></row><row><cell>Training data for the learn-</cell><cell>1000 documents from select</cell><cell>5000 documents from select</cell></row><row><cell>ing-to-rank algorithm</cell><cell>BioASQ Journal List</cell><cell>BioASQ Journal List</cell></row><row><cell>Method for selecting the</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>number of predicted MeSH</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>terms from the ranked list</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
