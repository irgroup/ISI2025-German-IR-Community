<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The main concept behind author profiling is to determine the traits of a writer from his/her written text. We can predict different characteristics of an author by analyzing his/her written text, for example, age, gender, native language, qualification and personality traits etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,210.10,517.81,10.65,9.05" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The writing style demonstrates the profile of an author and provides valuable information about his demographics. Identification of these author traits can be very helpful in different applications e.g. forensics analysis, security, intelligent marketing decisions, sentiment analysis and classification <ref type="bibr" coords="1,398.23,552.37,11.16,9.05" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present an approach, based on different types of stylistic features. In total, we applied 56 stylistic features. These features are divided into four categories including lexical, syntactic, character-based and vocabulary richness measures. The reason for selecting this methodology is that the training and test datasets are on different genres i.e. the training has done using Twitter data and the evaluation performed on other genre different from Twitter tweets. We expect that capturing an author's writing style on different types of training and testing data will yield good results.</p><p>The problem of gender and age identification also treated as a supervised document classification task. Different machine learning algorithms including J48, Random Forest and LADTree were explored for classification task. Various feature selection methods including Best-First and Ranker etc. were also investigated to identify the subset of best features from the set of 56 features. Best results on the training data were obtained (using the LADTree machine learning algorithm), where all the 56 features were used for the gender and age identification task. The trained system deployed on TIRA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.97,230.00,16.72,9.05" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for final evaluation on test dataset(s). The comparison of our system with other participants has shown in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,302.23,241.52,15.43,9.05" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work. Section 3 describes the proposed approach. Section 4 presents the experimental setup. Section 5 discusses results and their analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>Previous studies have commonly used Stylometry-based features to identify an author's traits from his/her writing style. For example, one of the pioneers in author profiling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,162.98,371.87,11.72,9.05" target="#b2">[3]</ref> explored some linguistic patterns in writing styles of authors which can be helpful in identifying different author traits like personality attributes, gender and age group. They carried out Part-Of-Speech tags analysis to get different stylistic features (i.e. function words, prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs) for identification of gender of an author and the accuracy of 72% and 66% for gender and age identification respectively. Argamon <ref type="bibr" coords="2,293.83,429.37,11.69,9.05" target="#b3">[4]</ref> et. al identified the demographics of an author by combining different features i.e. (function words with POS tags and obtained an accuracy of 80% for gender identification, In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.31,452.29,10.89,9.05" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.47,452.29,7.26,9.05" target="#b5">6]</ref>, authors presented a set of features like word unigrams, function words, non-dictionary words, hyperlinks for detection of age and gender of an author. Results showed 80% accuracy for gender identification and 75% accuracy for age identification. In the previous PAN Author Profiling Competitions, many submitted systems used stylistic features for predicting age, gender and personality types <ref type="bibr" coords="2,303.91,509.89,7.51,9.05" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.42,509.89,3.76,9.05" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.18,509.89,7.51,9.05" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Approach</head><p>Our proposed approach is based on Stylometric (the study of linguistic style) features, which help us to capture a set of elements of writing. Since the writing style of one author is likely to be different from others, therefore, these Stylometric features can be useful in discrimination between an author's traits. The other reason for selecting various types of stylistic features is that the training data is in one genre and the test data is in another genre. Therefore, stylistic features were expected to accurately identify author traits even if they are trained and tested on different types of data.</p><p>Our proposed approach combines different types of stylistic features including lexical, syntactic, vocabulary richness and character based features. The next sections describe these feature types in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Lexical Features</head><p>Lexical features represent text as a sequence of tokens forming sentences, paragraphs and documents. A token can be numeric number, alphabetic word of a punctuation mark. These tokens are used to get statistics like average sentence length and average word length <ref type="bibr" coords="3,179.93,207.56,10.69,9.05" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These features have the ability to get insights of a text in any language without special requirements. In our proposed system, we have implemented 7 lexical features: (1) average sentence length in characters, (2) average sentence length in words, (3) average word length, (4) percentage of question sentences, (5) total number of words, (6) total unique words and ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,330.37,253.55,3.90,9.05">7</ref>) words ratio of length 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Syntactic Features</head><p>Syntactic features consist of function words and parts-of-speech tags. Syntactic pattern varies significantly from one author to another. These features were extracted using more accurate and robust text analysis tools i.  <ref type="formula" coords="3,163.46,415.57,3.63,9.05">1</ref>), (15) POS bigram density (see Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,337.03,415.57,3.63,9.05" target="#formula_0">2</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" coords="3,354.77,415.57,8.36,9.05">16</ref>) POS trigram density (see Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,163.34,427.09,3.63,9.05">3</ref>).</p><p>𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = ( 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 ) × 100</p><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,138.86,483.27,318.13,21.84">𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝐵𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = ( 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝐵𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝐵𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 ) × 100<label>(2)</label></formula><p>𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = ( 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑂𝑆 𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 ) × 100</p><p>(3)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Vocabulary Richness</head><p>Every piece of text is composed of a set of unique words called its vocabulary. Vocabulary richness functions try to measure the diversity of vocabulary in a given text i.e. how rich is the vocabulary <ref type="bibr" coords="4,269.45,149.48,15.43,9.05" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Easiest and common example to understand vocabulary richness is hapax-legomena (number of words occurring exactly once) and type-token ratio i.e. V/N -where V is number of unique words in the text and N is the total number of words in the same text. Size of text/document directly affects the vocabulary size i.e. smaller documents will have less number of unique words while the larger ones will have higher number of unique words. To cater the influence of text size of vocabulary richness measures, a number of formulas have been used. In our proposed system, we have implemented 6 vocabulary richness measures (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,150.14,241.52,3.67,9.05" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Character Based Features</head><p>Character based features consider text as a sequence of characters. Thus, a number of character based measurements are defined including punctuation count, digit count, character count, colon count, comma count, question mark count etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,430.90,610.96,10.69,9.05" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Such information is easily available in any language and corpora. Our proposed system contains 26 character-based features: (1) character count, (2) percentage of punctuation characters, (3) character count without spaces, (4) percentage of semi colons, (5) ratio of digits, (6) percentage Of commas, (7) ratio of letters,(8) apostrophe count, (9) ratio of upper case letters, (10) brackets count, (11) ratio of white-spaces to N (total no of characters in an author profile), <ref type="bibr" coords="4,380.83,679.96,16.61,9.05" target="#b11">(12)</ref>  We pre-processed both training and test datasets by removing xml tags, html tags etc. and only used plain text for experimentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Methodology</head><p>The task of identifying an author's gender and age from his/her text is casted as a supervised document classification task. For gender identification, we have performed binary classification task i.e. goal is to distinguish between two classes: ( </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Analysis</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,151.46,175.28,4.17,9.05" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.1 shows the results for the proposed approach on both training and testing datasets. The results show that our proposed approach obtained promising results on the training data (0.983 accuracy for age trait, 0.787 accuracy for gender trait and 0.780 for both (joint identification of age and gender). This demonstrates that combination of different types of Stylometric features, which capture different types of information from a given text, is helpful in identifying age and gender of an author from his/her written text <ref type="foot" coords="6,224.21,243.21,3.24,5.89" target="#foot_2">2</ref> . Overall, results of the proposed approach are low for both testing datasets (pan16-test-dataset1-english and pan16-test-dataset2-english), particularly for the early bird's evaluation corpus (pan16-test-dataset1-english). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented an approach based on different types of stylistic features for identifying two author traits i.e. gender and age. The proposed system contains total 56 stylistic features including 7 lexical features, 16 syntactic features, 26 character-based features and 6 vocabulary richness measures. The system was trained using all the 56 features and different machine learning algorithms were explored including Random Forest, J48 and LADTree. Using the proposed approach, promising results were obtained on the training dataset (0.983 for age, 0.787 for gender and 0.780 for both (jointly identifying age and gender)). On the test data set, the proposed approach obtained accuracy of 0.371 for age, 0.576 for gender and 0.256 for both.</p><p>In future, we plan to combine other features, for example, content based, topic based etc., with stylistic features for cross-genre author profiling task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="4,143.06,264.89,306.73,248.35"><head>Table 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc></figDesc><table coords="4,143.06,264.89,306.73,248.35"><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="3">.1 Vocabulary richness measures</cell></row><row><cell>Sr. No</cell><cell cols="2">Feature Name Formula</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell>Brunet W Measure</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">𝑊 = 𝑁 𝑣 -.165</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>Hapax Legomena</cell><cell cols="3">𝑉 1 = (𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑒𝑥𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑙𝑦 𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒)</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>Honore R Measure</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">R =</cell><cell>100𝑙𝑜𝑔N 1 -( 𝑉 1 𝑉 )</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>Sichel S Measure</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>𝑆 =</cell><cell>𝑉 2 V</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>Simpson D Measure</cell><cell cols="2">D =</cell><cell>∑ 𝑛 (n -1) N(N -1)</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>Yule K Measure</cell><cell>K =</cell><cell cols="2">10 4 ∑ 𝑡 2 𝑉 𝑖 -𝑁 ∞ 𝑖=1 𝑁 2</cell></row></table></figure>

The possible reason for this is that proposed system is trained on one genre (tweets) and it is tested on another genre (blogs, reviews, social media etc.). Also the effect of evaluation on a test dataset with different genre as that of training dataset is reflected in the difference of accuracy scores for training and test datasets. The proposed system gives very high accuracy on age (0.983) and it drops to 0.371 on test dataset. On the other hand, the accuracy for gender on training dataset is low as compared to age, but it is high on the test dataset. This clearly shows that models trained on one genre may not give the same pattern of performance if they are evaluated on a data set, which contains author profiles from a different genre.</figDesc><table coords="6,124.82,318.20,345.70,150.82"><row><cell>Corpus</cell><cell>Age</cell><cell>Gender</cell><cell>Both</cell></row><row><cell>pan16-training-dataset-english</cell><cell>0.983</cell><cell>0.787</cell><cell>0.780</cell></row><row><cell>pan16-test-dataset1-english</cell><cell>0.290</cell><cell>0.497</cell><cell>0.149</cell></row><row><cell>pan16-test-dataset2-english</cell><cell>0.371</cell><cell>0.576</cell><cell>0.256</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">On the final evaluation corpus (pan16-test-dataset2-english), our proposed approach</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">obtained an accuracy of 0.371 for age, 0.576 for gender and 0.256 for both.</cell></row></table></figure>
