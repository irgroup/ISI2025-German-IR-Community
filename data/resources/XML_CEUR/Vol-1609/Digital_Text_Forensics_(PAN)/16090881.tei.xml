<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Languages shared by people differs due to diversity in their ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, language, religion, sexual orientation, geographical area, accents, pronunciation and word usages. This eventually fall into hypothesis that they follow unknown hidden pattern. By using this hypothesis, determining the class of a person such as age, gender, their personality and nativity has multiple applications in social media, forensic science, marketing analysis, e-commerce and e-security. This work advances the research on author profiling much further by overcoming existing language dependent, domain dependent and lexicon based author profiling methods by finding user's sociolect aspects based on authors statistical pattern of semantics in context space. It proves to be a domain and language independent method in Author Profiling by nearing constant performance over English, Dutch and Spanish corpus.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The amount of language sharing through Internet is prevalent due to the rapid growth of the social media resources like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and chat resources like Hike, Whatapp, Wechat <ref type="bibr" coords="1,341.39,537.56,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This positive growth ensures and encourages the recommendation and Internet marketing among users on a particular resource. It has been used in business organization for the marketing, market analysis, advertising and connecting with customers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,394.16,573.43,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This ensures the need of Author Profiling (AP) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,271.99,585.38,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in-order to discover user's sociolect aspects from shared language. The complication involved here is unlike natural language the language shared by the people on social media is small and unfortunate to extract information easily out of it.</p><p>People started revolving around authorship tasks, right from the ancient Greek play-wright times. Recognizing the age, gender, native language, personality and many more facets that frame the profile of a particular person. It finds application in different zones like forensic security, literary research, marketing analysis, industries, on-line messengers, e-commerce , chats in mobile applications, medical applications to treat neuroticism and many more <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.07,143.90,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Forensic Linguistics came into existence only after 1968. In this sector, police register is one of the area under security, in which the statements taken down by the police act as a source text for Author Profiling (AP). Legal investigation continues its examination on all fields of suspicion.</p><p>In marketing, on-line customer reviews in blogs and sites helps the consumers in deciding his/her choice about shopping a product. Detecting the age and gender of the person who posted his/her feedback paves way for the owners to improve their business strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.76,247.23,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Industries get benefited with customer's suggestions and reviews from which they could group the most likely products based on the gender and age. Twitter and Facebook are the popularly used sites for social media. In last year survey, it shows that every month there are about 236 million users who sign up to the micro blogging site-Twitter and 1.44 billion users to Facebook but among them 83.09 millions are fake accounts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.70,307.00,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The author with age under 13 and author having more than one account noted as fake account which has to be taken care. There may also be anon who tend to have many fake id's and post messages and chat with innocent people in order to trap them.</p><p>In general Machine Learning (ML) algorithm can be used to attain this objective if subjected to relevant features and most of the existing methods follow the same <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.65,398.37,20.40,8.74">[3][4]</ref>. In existing methods common and most commonly used features for AP are author's style based features (punctuation marks, usage of capitals, POS tags, sentence length, repeated usage of words, quotations), content based features (topic related words, words present in dictionaries), content and typographical ease, words that express sentiments and emotions with emoticons, special words from which information could be extracted, collocations and ngrams. These features are dependent on lexicon which varies with respect to the topic, genre and language. In ML, the low dimensional condensed vectors which exhibit a relation between the terms, documents and the profile was built using Concise Semantic Analysis (CSA) in order to create the second order attributes (SOA) which was classified using a linear model and also became sensitive to high dimensional problems . This system was further extended in 2014 to make it more precise in profiling. With the generation of highly informative attributes (creating sub profiles) using Expectation Maximization Clustering (EMC) algorithm, the system built was able to group sub classes within a cluster and exhibit a relation between sub profiles. Though this system was successful,it was dependent to the language and genre <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.73,589.65,20.40,8.74">[3][4]</ref>.</p><p>The syntactic and lexical features utilized in earlier models vary with respect to the morphological and agglutinative nature of the language. These features also varies with respect to the domain in which the AP is performed. There exists a conflict between classifying algorithms to learn from these features in order to build a unified and effective classification model which is independent of domain and language. This can be observed from system's performance in PAN -AP shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.57,131.95,11.22,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>[4] <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.01,131.95,11.22,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In order to overcome these conflicts, this paper proposes a model based on statistical semantics from author's digital text. Statistical semantics paves way to the advancement in research of relational similarity by including statistical features of word distribution along with traditional semantic features utilized in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,281.58,191.96,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is clear that sexual aspects and vocabulary knowledge of a person varies due to human's cognitive phenomena which induces and also limits people of a particular gender and age group to utilize certain range of words to convey their message. Thus by utilizing this word distribution in context space and their statistical features, the gender and age group of a particular author is identified in this work. The basic idea is to utilize the distributional representation of an author's document to aggregate the statistical semantic information and promote a set of constraints for finding related hypotheses of that author's document.</p></div>

Their data included 213 million tweets on the whole from 18.5 million users. Tweets collected were multilingual. As tweets include many more contents like emoticons, images etc., feature extraction part was limited to a particular n-gram length with total distinct features of 15,572,522. Word level and character level n-grams were chosen. There was no language specific processing done but instead only n-gram counts were taken into account. Once features were extracted classifiers namely SVM, Naive Bayes and Winnow2 were evaluated out of which Winnow2 performed exceptionally well with an overall accuracy of 92%. Their work was done only for gender classifying gender information <ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.88,465.35,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Lizi told that the entrance to colossal measure of client produced information empowers them to examine lifetime semantic variety of individuals. The center reason of the model is that age impacts the point piece of a client, and every subject has an interesting age conveyance. They made use of Gibbs EM algorithm for evaluating their model. They were able to find information of both word distribution and age distribution from the sample of twitter data they collected.

The proposed representation extended the examination fusing data among writings in the same profile, this is, they concentrated in subprofiles. For this, they naturally discover subprofiles and assemble report vectors that speak to more itemized connections of archives and subprofile records. Results shows proof of the helpfulness of intra-profile data to focus sex and age profiles.

Suraj uses MapReduce programming standard for most parts of their preparation process, which makes their framework quick. Their framework uses word n-grams including stopwords, accentuations and emoticons as components and TF-IDF (term recurrence reverse report recurrence) as the measuring plan. These were bolstered to the logistic relapse classifier that predicts the age and sexual orientation of the creators.

This column called as the context space with respect to the author's documents.

Linear combination of basis vectors (column vectors) of W with coefficients of H gives the context matrix V . While factorizing, formerly random values are assigned to W and H then the optimization function in equation 4 is applied on it to compute appropriate W and H. Where, r is the reduced dimension and F is the Frobenius norm. Here r fixed as m to have m × m context matrix. The basis vectors in W considered as the basis vector of context space, which are linearly combined with elements in the H to recompute the V . The singular or eigen vector based computation methods avoided here, since they constrained and forced to found the orthogonal basis vectors. This may not form the exact context space of the author's documents. Since the occurrence of the words in a documents cannot be a negative value, which is affordable by NMF and the non-negativity constraints makes interpretability straight forward than the other factorization methods <ref type="bibr" coords="5,232.81,297.76,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Each element in the matrix W is a distributed representation of the semantic information of the author's documents in context space.

Statistical features include the marginal decision boundaries with respect to word distribution in each document vector W i based on each class which has to be classified. Performing NMF moves the values in W from discrete to continuous. Thus by taking W i as a random variable 1 and by fixing random variable 2 as other distributions (Normal, Gamma, Chisquare, Rayleigh and Pareto Distributions), the correlation, null hypothesis between them are measured.

The data-set chosen for this experimentation is from the PAN CLEF AP 2016 workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="6,449.60,597.34,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="6,465.09,597.34,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> which are built with challenges involved in real word applications. The 2016 corpus incorporates Twitter data of users for training and reviews, blog data of the authors taken as test data. This is also included in three languages (English, Dutch and Spain). Among them Dutch data-set does not have age-group information. During pre-processing, author's text alone extracted for further actions. As detailed in problem definition section, the total documents (Author's tweets) represented as a Document-Term matrix (m × n). This matrix multiplied with its transposed version to get the document-document co-occurrence matrix of size m × m. Further NMF applied on the document-document matrix to get the basis vector matrix (Context Matrix) with r = m. The basis vector of the each author's document considered as a random variable and its correlation with other distribution random variables mentioned in the section 2 are measured as the features. This final, feature matrix is utilized to construct the classification model which is built using Random Forest Tree classifiers. Here the classification model is built based on 100 decision trees, constructed to form the random forest tree. Initially gender classification is performed and by feeding its result to the feature matrix, age group is classified. Same process applied on the three languages without any change. All the above done in Python and its packages (Scikit Learn and Scipy). 10 fold cross validation is performed to measure the training performance and given in the Table <ref type="table" coords="7,233.30,621.25,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The measures performed on individual (English, Dutch and Spanish) and combined data-sets (English and Spanish). Thought the proposed performance not greater in accuracy, from results it can be observed that, proposed model shows constant accuracy over the all the language and genre.</p><p>This ensures that proposed model act as the language and domain independent method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>With the global need for author profiling system this experimentation has brought forth a simple, unified and reliable model for finding the demographic features of an individual by extracting statistical semantics property of context space. This is achieved by incorporating the Document -Term Matrix, Non -Negative Matrix Factorization and statistical features along with the Random Forest Tree classifier. From the results it can be concluded that this serves as the domain and language independent method, however there is still room for improvement. The future work will be extending and implementing proposed algorithm on distributed computation frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,181.16,227.59,299.43,8.74;4,134.77,239.54,345.82,8.74;4,134.77,251.50,345.83,8.74;4,134.77,263.45,345.82,8.74;4,134.77,275.41,345.83,8.74;4,134.77,287.36,345.83,8.74;4,134.77,299.32,73.06,8.74"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>PAN 2016, in PAN 2013, PAN 2014 and PAN 2015 the training and testing were done on similar domains.
