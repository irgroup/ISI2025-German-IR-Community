<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cascaded speech recognition (SR) and information extraction (IE) could support the best practice for clinical handover and release clinicians' time from writing documents to patient interaction and education. However, high requirements for processing correctness evoke methodological challenges and hence, processing correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the requirements. This overview paper reports on how these issues were addressed in a shared task of the eHealth evaluation lab of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) in 2016. This IE task built on the 2015 CLEF eHealth Task on SR by using its 201 synthetic handover documents for training and validation (appr. 8, 500 + 7, 700 words) and releasing another 100 documents with over 6, 500 expert-annotated words for testing. It attracted 25 team registrations and 3 team submissions with 2 methods each. When using the macro-averaged F1 over the 35 form headings present in the training documents for evaluation on the test documents, all participant methods outperformed all 4 baselines, including the organizers' method (F1 = 0.25), published in 2015 in a top-tier medical informatics journal and provided to the participants as an option to build on, a random classifier (F1 = 0.02), and majority classifiers for the two most common classes (i.e., NA to filter out text irrelevant to the form and the most common form heading, both with F1 &lt; 0.00). The top-2 methods (F1 = 0.38 and 0.37) had statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) better performance than the third-best method (F1 = 0.35). In comparison, the top-3 methods and the organizers' method (7th) had F1 of 0.81, 0.80, 0.81, and 0.75 in the NA class, respectively.</p></div>

This shift-change nursing handover is a form of clinical narrative where only a small part of the flow is documented electronically in writing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.46,217.87,10.51,8.80" target="#b2">[3]</ref> although without this, anything from two-thirds to all spoken handover information transferred incorrectly or lost completely already after a couple of shift changes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,195.72,241.78,10.51,8.80" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.90,241.78,7.01,8.80" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Moreover, failures in the flow of information from nursing handover are a major contributing factor in over two-thirds of sentinel events in hospitals and associated with over a tenth of preventable adverse events <ref type="bibr" coords="2,452.25,265.69,9.96,8.80" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>As a mechanism to contribute to quality and safety in healthcare, best practice for the handover information documentation recommends standardized, structured, and synchronous processes at patient site in the presence and active involvement of the patients, and where relevant, their next-of-kin <ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.98,314.17,9.96,8.80" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. <ref type="foot" coords="2,437.25,312.62,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_0">5</ref> In order to support their compliance, cascaded speech recognition (SR) with information extraction (IE) has been studied since 2015 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,334.13,338.08,10.51,8.80" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,346.30,338.08,7.01,8.80" target="#b7">8]</ref>, also as part of the eHealth evaluation lab by the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,467.31,350.04,9.96,8.80" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As justified empirically in clinical settings in 2014, the cascade pre-fills a structured handover form for a clinician to proof, edit, and sign off <ref type="bibr" coords="2,417.90,373.95,15.49,8.80" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.06,373.95,11.62,8.80" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Based on the rate of information loss above, the approach of the nurse who is handing over revising and signing off the document draft him/herself any time before the shift ends (but preferably immediately after the handover) can decrease the loss from 0 to 13 per cent.</p><p>This novel application evokes fruitful challenges for method research and development, and consequently, its SR part and IE parts were chosen as the CLEF eHealth 2015 Task 1a <ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.34,458.29,15.49,8.80" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and CLEF eHealth 2016 Task 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.38,458.29,14.61,8.80" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, respectively. <ref type="foot" coords="2,160.77,468.69,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_1">6</ref> First, SR is complicated by clinical characteristics of a large number of nurses moving between patient sites to involve patients in handover, resulting in a noisy minimally-personalized multi-speaker setting far from a typical case with a single person, equipped with a personalized SR engine, speaking in a peaceful office. Second, SR errors multiply in cascading with IE. Because of the severe implications that these errors may have in clinical judgment and decisionmaking, the cascade correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the healthcare requirements.</p><p>The cascaded tasks align with the CLEF eHealth usage scenario of easing patients, their next-of-kin, and other laypersons in understanding and accessing electronic health (eHealth) information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.74,590.46,15.49,8.80" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.89,590.46,11.62,8.80" target="#b14">15]</ref>. Namely, the application could release a substantial amount of healthcare workers' time from documentation to, for example, longer discussions about the findings, care plans, and consumerfriendly resources for further information with the patients, and/or their nextof-kin. Fulfilling the legal requirement to document every event in healthcare can take over half of nurses' working time with centralized clinical information systems or fully structured information entry (whilst free-form text entry at the patient-site decreases this to a few minutes per patient) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,395.23,190.66,12.45,8.80" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,407.67,190.66,4.15,8.80" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,411.82,190.66,12.45,8.80" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. SR drafts a written document from a tenth to three-quarters of the time it takes to transcribe this by hand, whilst the clinician's proofing time is approximately the same in both cases <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.15,226.53,14.61,8.80" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, or equivalently, draft text for a minute of handover speech (with 160 words, corresponding to the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words <ref type="bibr" coords="3,203.40,250.44,15.49,8.80" target="#b19">[20]</ref>) is available only 20 seconds after finishing the handover with a real-time SR engine that recognizes at least as many words per minute as a very skilled typist (i.e., 120 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,279.83,274.35,14.76,8.80" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). Cascading this with content structuring through IE can bring further efficiency gains by easing finding information and making this content available for computerized surveillance and decision-making in healthcare <ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.56,310.22,14.61,8.80" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this organizers' overview of the Task 1 of the CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2016 on handover IE is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the materials and methods provided and used by the organizers in the task. In Section 3, we introduce the task results. In Section 4, we conclude by summarizing the main findings, relating them with previous work on clinical IE, and discussing the significance of this study.</p></div>

This organizers' method called NICTA served as one of the four baseline methods.</p><p>The NICTA method solved the IE task by using the CRF++ implementation<ref type="foot" coords="5,160.77,541.05,7.94,6.16" target="#foot_5">10</ref> of the Conditional Random Fields <ref type="bibr" coords="5,325.87,542.60,15.49,8.80" target="#b23">[24]</ref> trained on the training set and validated on the validation set <ref type="bibr" coords="5,267.11,554.56,15.49,8.80" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,284.26,554.56,11.62,8.80" target="#b26">26]</ref>, prior to testing it on the independent test set. The method generated its eight syntactic (e.g., the lemma, part of speech tag, and parse tree of a given word), three semantic (i.e., the top-5 candidates of a given word retrieved the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), its top UMLS mapping, and its medication score, derived from the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical List), and two statistical feature types (i.e., the location of a given word on a ten-point scale from the beginning of the document to its end and the number of times a given term occurs in a document divided by the maximum of this term frequency over all terms in the document) by processing the original text documents using Stanford CoreNLP (English grammar) by the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group <ref type="bibr" coords="6,339.85,166.75,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, MetaMap 2012 by the US National Library of Medicine <ref type="bibr" coords="6,265.16,178.71,14.61,8.80" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, and Ontoserver by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,417.29,190.66,14.61,8.80" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</p><p>The other three baselines were Random (i.e., classifying each word by selecting one out of the 36 classes randomly <ref type="foot" coords="6,302.00,213.02,7.94,6.16" target="#foot_6">11</ref> ), NA [i.e., classifying each word as belonging to the dominant training class of 36) NA], and Majority [i.e., classifying each word as belonging to the majority training class of 11) Future_Goal/Task-ToBeCompleted/ExpectedOutcome].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Statistical Significance Testing in Performance Evaluation</head><p>Statistical differences between the F1 MaA percentages of the methods were evaluated in Task 1 using the R 3.2.4 implementation of the Wilcoxon signedrank test (W ) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,198.10,322.37,14.61,8.80" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. <ref type="foot" coords="6,216.37,320.81,7.94,6.16" target="#foot_7">12</ref> This test was chosen as an alternative to the paired t-test, because of not being able assume that the F1 MaA percentages for the sample of the 100 test documents were normally distributed.</p><p>After ranking the baselines and submissions based on their F1 MaA on the entire test set, W was computed for the paired comparisons from the best and second-best method to the second-worst and worst method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>The task released a training set of 101 synthetic clinical documents on 30 October 2015; an independent validation set of 100 documents on 30 October 2015; and an independent test set of 100 documents on 15 April 2016. The test set annotations were not released before 1 August 2016.</p><p>The task was open for everybody. We particularly welcomed academic and industrial researchers, scientists, engineers and graduate students in SR, natural language processing, and biomedical/health informatics. We also encouraged participation by multi-disciplinary teams that combine technological skills with content expertise in nursing.</p><p>By 30 April 2016, 25 teams had registered their interest in the task through the CLEF 2016 registration system. <ref type="foot" coords="6,287.13,590.00,7.94,6.16" target="#foot_8">13</ref> Each team was allowed to submit two fully automated methods (or compilations) -referred to as using the suffixesA and B ) after the team name. The team TUC-MI followed an interdisciplinary approach and consisted of four computer scientists, supervised by one professor. Two scientists brought the expertise from the field of natural language processing as well as information retrieval exploring features for the clinical context. The other two scientists had practical experience in machine learning and computational linguistics. The latter group developed strategies for feature subset selection and performed parameter optimization for learning methods. The team's approach focused on the exploration of relevant features for CRFs. Therefore, the team used wrappers for feature subset selection in conjunction with parameter optimization to consider how the algorithm and the dataset interact. First, as TUC-MI-A, the team composed a set of 41 features based on Stanford CoreNLP, latent Dirichlet allocation, regular expressions, and the ontologies of WordNet and UMLS. Next, the team applied the heuristic methods best-first and greedy (hill-climbing) with forward and backward direction to feature evaluation and selection. In the development phase, the team also observed that 19 out of 41 features performed best in combination with the hyperparameter C = 10 of the CRF classifier and submitted this configuration as TUC-MI-B.</p><p>The team LQRZ had an Artificial Intelligence Master Student, a Postdoc supervisor, and a Master in Artificial Intelligence supervisor. Its both methods tried to avoid the feature engineering handcraft effort and aimed at using general domain data (no clinical specifics). The method LQRZ-A consisted of a one-hidden-layer (tanh) Multilayer Perceptron, with a context window of 7, trained with Adagrad for 50 epochs. Its parameters were the following: W 1: word embeddings -intersected with the GoogleNews pretrained embeddings (300 dimensions), b1: uniform bias, W 2: uniform weights, and b2: uniform bias. The output layer (softmax) computed the probability of the word belonging to each form tag (39 tags, considering the training and validation set tags). The method LQRZ-B consisted of an ensemble method. On the first step, a Random forest was used to identify NA tags (by binary-discriminating between NA and Others). On the second step, a one-hidden-layer (tanh) Multilayer Perceptron, with a context window of 7 was used to categorize between the remaining tags. The Random forest used the GoogleNews pretrained embeddings (300 dimensions) as features (and a random-sampled vector if the word was not found in the word2vec model). The Multilayer Perceptron parameters were as above.</p><p>The team ECNU_ICA had six people in total: a PhD student, three graduate students, and two professors. They had participated evaluation labs on clinical language processing before. In its method ECNU_ICA-A, the team extracted the bed number, room number, age, and doctor's name by using rules. Then, the team ran the organizers' CRF and combined its result with the result obtained by utilizing rules. In contrast, in the method ECNU_ICA-B, the team selected Table <ref type="table" coords="8,164.07,115.84,4.13,7.93">1</ref>. Performance of the four baselines and six submissions on the 100 test documents. In the F1 MaA column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the method of the row was significantly better than the method of the row below (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signedrank test). The top-3 values for each measure are emphasized. When the organizers' announced the evaluation results on the test set to the participants, the team LQRZ noticed an unfortunate human error in the output writing of both methods. The organizers allowed them to re-submit and the results corresponding to the corrected outputs are included below.

Then, the team ran the organizers' CRF based on those features only. At last, it use the method of voting to determine the class for each word, used the IE rules of the ECNU_ICA-A for the bed number, room number, age, and doctor's name, and combined the results obtained by utilizing rules and voting methods. We organizers' were excited that all three participating teams scored among the top 3 and all six participant methods outperformed all four baselines in Task 1 (Tables <ref type="table" coords="8,177.28,468.63,4.98,8.80">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="8,203.96,468.63,3.87,8.80" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), including the organizers' method, published in 2015 in a toptier medical informatics journal. The top-2 methods had the F1 MaA percentages of 38.2 (TUC-MI-B with F1 NA of 80.7 per cent) and 37.4 (ECNU_ICA-A with F1 NA of 80.2 per cent), respectively. Their difference was not statistically significant but they were significantly better than the 34.5 per cent performance of the third-best method (LQRZ-B with F1 NA of 81.3 per cent). In comparison, the NICTA baseline with its F1 MaA percentage of 24.6 (and F1 NA of 74.9 per cent) was significantly worse than the participant methods but significantly better than the Random, Majority, and NA baselines with the respective F1 MaA percentages of 1.9, 0.1, and 0.0.</p></div>
