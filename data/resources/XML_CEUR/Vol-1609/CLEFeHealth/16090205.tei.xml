<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We describe LIMSI experiments in ICD10 coding of death certificate statements with the CépiDc dataset of the CLEF eHealth 2016 Track 2. We tested a classifier with humanly-interpretable output, based on IR-style ranking of candidate ICD10 diagnoses. A tf.idf-weighted bagof-feature vector was built for each training set code by merging all the statements found for this code in the training data. Given a new statement, we ranked candidate codes with Cosine similarity. Features included meta-information and n-grams of normalized tokens. We also prepared an ICD chapter classifier with the same method and used it to rerank the top-k codes (k=2) returned by the code classifier. For development we focused on mono-code statements and obtained a P@1 of 0.749 increased to 0.778 by chapter reranking. On the test data we returned one code for each statement, leaving multiple code assignment for future work, and obtained a precision, recall and F-measure of (0.7650, 0.5686, 0.6524).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Coding in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been the subject of a number of studies in the past (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.95,536.57,10.67,8.74" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,326.62,536.57,7.11,8.74" target="#b1">2]</ref>). Until recently, only one shared task had taken it as its target <ref type="bibr" coords="1,270.26,548.52,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and after ten more years the CLEF eHealth 2016 Task 2 on multilingual information extraction offers a much larger-scale and real-life dataset for ICD10 coding.</p><p>The main methods for coding or more generally for concept normalization rely on dictionary-based lexical matching and on machine-learning. In the medical domain, most dictionary-based methods use the UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="1,406.38,608.30,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or one of the vocabularies it contains, including the ICD10 classification. For the English language, MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="1,211.04,632.21,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is the best known system and combines the wealth of term variants of the UMLS MetaThesaurus with lexical knowledge including morphological rules from the UMLS Specialist Lexicon to map phrases to UMLS concepts. Language-agnostic methods of approximate term look-up have also been proposed <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.71,130.95,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Koopman et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.76,143.13,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> studied the classification of Australian death certificates as pertaining to diabetes, influenza, pneumonia and HIV with SVM classifiers based on n-grams and SNOMED CT concepts, and with rules. They also addressed their classification into 3-digit ICD-10 codes such as E10. In another study, the same team <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.14,190.95,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> trained SVM classifiers to find ICD-10 diagnostic codes for cancerrelated death certificates. Because they focused on cancer, they used a first-level classifier to identify the presence of cancer then applied a second-level classifier to identify the specific type of cancer, again as 3-digit ICD-10 codes from C00 to C97. An important difference from the present work is that they targeted the underlying cause of death, i.e., one diagnosis per death certificate, whereas we aim to determine all the diagnoses mentioned in a given death certificate, more precisely at the level of each input statement. Besides, the present work addresses full four-digit ICD-10 codes (e.g., R09.2) instead of three-digit codes (e.g., R09).</p><p>The International Classification of Diseases is hierarchical, and previous work has tried to take advantage of this hierarchy to improve classification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.19,322.68,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,452.70,322.68,7.01,8.74" target="#b3">4]</ref>. We have performed limited experiments to leverage the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 by using an ICD chapter classifier to rerank base results.</p><p>The present work addresses the coding of death certificate statements with no restriction on the domain, i.e., into the whole of ICD-10. Rather than aiming at a method that would obtain the best possible results, we were interested in exploring simple, humanly-interpretable vector space representations which would highlight the importance of each word in the classification. We selected an Information Retrieval style method based on the vector space model and Cosine similarity and made experiments with it, reporting a relatively good precision (0.7650) on the official test set. Since we only targeted one code per statement and reserved multi-label classification for further work, we miss the many additional codes present in statements with multiple codes and obtain a limited recall of 0.5686 on the official test set.</p><p>We describe how we prepared the source data (Section 2), the methods we tested to find ICD10 codes for input statements (Section 3), ICD10 chapter classification and its use for reranking (Section 4). Experiments and results on the training dataset are presented and discussed along the way. We then provide the results obtained on the test set, perform a short error analysis based on the training set, and discuss perspectives for future work (Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preparation of the material</head><p>CLEF eHealth 2016 participants were provided with the 'Aligned Causes' file (AlignedCauses 2006-2012.csv) which contains 65,843 death certificates split into close to 200,000 diagnostic statements. Each diagnostic statement has associated metadata and zero, one or more ICD-10 codes. In the provided training and test data, statements with multiple codes were repeated on as many lines as they had codes. We considered such repeated statements as one statement, and a large part of our work focused on statements with exactly one code. Besides, we used the resulting list of diagnostic statements independently of each other, without taking into account their grouping into death certificates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Basic processing</head><p>We processed each diagnostic statement as follows:</p><p>tokenize (French style: NLTK v3.2.1, regular expression); remove stop words (French NLTK); remove diacritics; lower-case; stem (Snowball French stemmer in NLTK).</p><p>All programs here and in the remainder of this work were written using Python v3.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Hyphenated words</head><p>A number of medical words are (often neoclassical) morphological compound words (e.g., cardiovasculaire). These words are often written with hyphens (e.g., cardio-vasculaire), and sometimes even split (e.g., cardio vasculaire). To normalize these words, we adopted the following strategy:</p><p>-Our goal is to replace variants with the split form: we hope this will allow to take better account of the components of these words (e.g., the component vasculaire in cardiovasculaire will share counts with the free-standing vasculaire in arrêt vasculaire). -To build a dictionary which normalizes concatenated forms to split forms,</p><p>• We collect tokens with hyphens in statements.</p><p>• We produce concatenated forms from these tokens.</p><p>• We associate the concatenated form to the split form in the dictionary.</p><p>• Once all forms in the training corpus have been processed, dictionary expansions are examined to find tokens which are themselves an entry in the dictionary: these tokens are replaced with their split form. -During tokenization, hyphenated forms are split on hyphens. Their components are checked for further splitting based on the above dictionary. Nonhyphenated forms which have an entry in the dictionary are replaced with the associated split form. -In a few cases, components are not meaningful in French (e.g., the English load word pace-maker, or the misspellings inhalat-ion, aort-ique, ac-fa). A small set of exceptions (the four above-mentioned cases) was compiled manually based on an examination of the dictionary built with the training corpus. Instead of being split during tokenization, they are replaced with their concatenated form (pacemaker, inhalation etc.).</p><p>The addition of this processing improved precision by about 1pt in all experiments. For the sake of space, we only present below experiments where this processing is included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">ICD-10 data</head><p>We obtained the ICD-10 hierarchy from the UMLS MRREL table and used it to know which code belongs to which ICD-10 chapter. In some experiments we also used the actual labels of the ICD-10 diagnoses. For this purpose, we used the French ICD10, German Modification, version of 2014, downloaded on 12 Feb 2015.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">IR-style, vector space representation for coding</head><p>We tested information-retrieval type methods as described below.</p><p>3 Only the top code is used in the prediction. Additionally, the following codes are computed to evaluate success-at-N metrics (this is detailed in Section Experiments below). Besides, examining the quality of the top-N codes can inform us about the potential relevance of reranking methods which could be applied to these top-N codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experiments</head><p>Base principle: test on last 10,000 statements, train on rest (-10k*) For our experiments, we split the CépiDc training corpus into a training split and a test split. The training split consists of the training corpus except its last 10,000 statements (i.e., the first 185,203 statements). The test split consists of the last 10,000 statements, which were all coded in year 2012.</p><p>A tf.idf model was created from the training corpus as explained above. Only mono-code statements were used for training.</p><p>Statements in the test split were coded as explained above. For each such statement, we measured the following information: whether the correct code was found among the top N codes (Success@N, or S@N, for N ∈ [1 . . . 5], as named for instance in TREC); note that S@1 is equal to P@1 (precision computed by examining only the top returned code), and that we therefore often use the term "precision" to comment success results; for some of the tests, the official scoring program was also applied to the system results and computed Precision, Recall and F-measure based on all statements in the test split (columns P, R, F).</p><p>We were mostly interested in evaluating results on mono-code statements, since these are those for which our system is relevant. As we shall see below, they represent 77% of the statements in the test split. However, for information, we also evaluated results on all statements with at least one code (98% of the statements in the test split; the remaining 1.7% have no associated code). These two settings imply a different number of statements submitted to the test.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,177.36,387.03,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides this information for the various experiments described below. The experiment name (-10k*) codes the characteristics of the experiment, such as 10k (10,000 statements in the test split), 1 (mono-codes) vs. a (all statements with at least one code), etc. Column Sttmts shows the actual number of statements submitted to the test, then the rest of the columns provide evaluation results as described above. The same statements are evaluated by testing whether the code found has the correct ICD10 chapter (rows Chapter, shown for a subset of the evaluations). The statistical significance of differences between experiments was computed using approximate randomization at p &lt; 0.01.</p><p>We now turn to the description of a series of experiments performed by adding various features to the representation of statements. <ref type="table" coords="5,249.90,527.55,4.07,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, rows -10k1t) In this test, the only features for a training or test statement are its normalized tokens. We test our classifier on the subset of 7669 statements with exactly one code among the 10,000 test statements (mono-code statements): in this setting, one precision point (1%) represents 77 statements. As shown on row -10k1t Codes, 71.1% of these statements obtain a correct code at rank 1, and for 84.1% the top code belongs to the correct ICD10 chapter (row Chapter). Success increases significantly between S@1 and S@2 both for codes (12pt from 0.711 to 0.836) and for chapters (10pt from 0.841 to 0.941).  -10katmBt: unigrams, pairs, trigrams and meta-information. -10katmBT: pairs and triples. -10katmbt4: 1-4grams and meta-information. S@1 results in bold have a statistically significant difference with the previous row; those in italics have a statistically significant difference with two rows above.</p></div>

S@1 S@2 S@3 S@4 S@ statement which supported the choice of a target code (StandardText field). In the CépiDc coding process, the human coder records in this field the text segment which led to the chosen ICD10 code for the current line, keeping only content words and correcting spelling errors if any. If training is performed on the tokens of the standardized form of a statement instead of the tokens of the original form, performance decreases by 2pt (codes, not shown in table). If training is performed on the tokens of both the original and the standardized form of a statement (rows -10k1ts), performance decreases less, by 0.5pt to S@1=0.706 (codes), and this is confirmed when evaluating on all statements (not shown in table). We therefore do not pursue with this feature.</p><p>Meta-information (-10k1tm) Meta-information, provided in the CépiDc training and test data, was added as follows to training and test bag-of-words:</p><p>-Gender: two features, =g0 and =g1 -Age: 5 features corresponding to age ranges based on clusters of initial fiveyear age ranges : =a0, =a5-20, =a25-35, =a40-65, =a70-; these clusters were manually selected based on a study of the distribution of ages per ICD10 chapter in the training set -LocationOfDeath: 6 features, one for each LocationOfDeath in the source: =l1, =l2, . . . , =l6 -Type of interval: 5 features, one for each LocationOfDeath in the source: =i1, =i2, . . . , =i5</p><p>The addition of these four types of meta-information (rows -10k1tm) slightly improves S@1 (+0.3pt for codes at 0.714, not significant, no improvement and S@2 by 2.6pt (codes: 0.862).</p><p>Bigrams (-10k1tmb), pairs (-10k1tmB), trigrams (-10k1tmbt), triples (-10k1tmbT), tetragrams (-10k1tmbt4) of tokens were added as follows to training and test bag-of-words:</p><p>-After tokens were computed and normalized and stop-words removed,</p><p>• sequences of n consecutive tokens were joined into one n-gram (with space separator); • the list of normalized tokens was sorted (in alphabetical order); sets of non-necessarily contiguous tokens were joined into one pair (resp. triple) (with space separator); the order of tokens in pairs or triples is always the alphabetical order. Note that pairs include sorted bigrams, and triples include sorted trigrams.</p><p>The addition of bigrams on top of meta-information (rows -10k1tmb) improves S@1 by 2.0pt (codes: 0.734, chapters: 0.861). If pairs are used instead of bigrams (rows -10k1tmB), S@1 improves by another 0.9pt (codes: 0.743) but does not change for chapters (+0.1pt at 0.861).</p><p>The addition of trigrams on top of bigrams (rows -10k1tmbt) obtains an improvement of 0.4pt on S@1 (codes: 0.738, chapters: 0.860). The addition of trigrams to pairs (rows -10k1tmBt) does not change S@1 much (codes: 0.744, chapters: 0.860).</p><p>The addition of pairs and triples (rows -10k1tmBT) instead of bigrams and trigrams further improves S@1 (codes: 0.749).</p><p>Adding tetragrams to bigrams and trigrams increases S@1 by 0.3pt (-10k1tmbt4, codes 0.741). Adding 5-grams (-10k1tmbt45) does not obtain a further increase.</p><p>ICD10 labels (-10k1tmbt4i) Some ICD10 codes present in the test corpus may occur rarely or not at all in the training corpus. To make sure that every ICD10 code is known to the trained model, we add ICD10 terms as additional training material. They are added to the ICD code 'documents':</p><p>-The label of each ICD10 code is tokenized and normalized as described in Section 2. -One 'document' is created for each code: if multiple labels are available for a code, they are pasted into one such document. -These 'documents' are merged with those obtained from the training corpus.</p><p>-A bag-of-words, tf.idf model is computed from the token×document matrix as explained in Section 3.1.</p><p>Added to one of the best configurations (1-4-grams, meta-information), this does not bring a significant change S@1 (+0.1pt = 0.742).</p><p>Testing on statements with at least one code (-10ka*) All tests until now were performed on the mono-code statements of our test split. Our system is designed to produce one code per statement, whatever the expected number of codes. In the case of a multi-code statement, the evaluation considers this code correct if it matches any of the expected codes. Testing on all statements with at least one code therefore results in a slightly higher precision: for instance, with 1-4-grams and meta-information (-10kambt4), +1.2pt for codes and +0.8pt for chapters. Differences among the top performing features are not significant anymore in this setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Official evaluation program</head><p>We also applied the official evaluation program to the same system output, comparing it to the full set of 10,000 statements in our test split. Its precision is consistent with Success@1. It adds the measurement of recall, which is necessarily impaired when our system is run only on the 7669 mono-code subset of the test split, and which is harmed anyway because our system returns one code per statement even for multi-code statements. This results in an F-measure of 0.640 for -10katmbt4 (1-4-grams and meta-information), which we retain for further experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Chapter classification and reranking</head><p>We have seen that success increases sharply from S@1 to S@2, suggesting that reranking the top proposed codes could lead to improvements. For instance, finding the ICD10 chapter for a statement, if precise enough, could help rerank candidate codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Chapter classification as search</head><p>Therefore, we created an ICD10 chapter classifier in the same way as the ICD10 code classifier:</p><p>-Each tested document is represented as a bag-of-words with tf.idf weights according to this model. -This representation is compared to the representations of the training 'documents', which represent the ICD10 chapters present in the training corpus.</p><p>Cosine similarity is used. -The top-N most similar documents (chapters) are returned.</p><p>Only the top code is used in the prediction (the following codes are only computed to evaluate success at N metrics).</p><p>Experiments Table <ref type="table" coords="9,223.69,232.50,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows the results obtained for chapter classification on our test split. Using the best features found for codes (1-4-grams and metainformation), chapter classification reaches a S@1 of 0.873 (mono-codes) or 0.882 (statements with at least one code), which looks reasonably good enough to attempt to use it for reranking. -10kC1t: only test on 7669 mono-code subset of the latter 10,000 statements; features = tokens. -10kC1tmbt: add meta-information, bigrams and trigrams -10kC1tmbt4: add 4grams. -10kC1tmBT: pairs and triples. -10kCatmbt: test on all statements with at least one code, features = tokens, meta-information, bigrams and trigrams.</p><p>-10kCatmbt4: add 4grams. -10kCatmBT: pairs and triples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results</head><p>The system was trained with parameters -10kBatmbt4 (codes reranked with chapters, with 1-4grams and meta-information) on the full training set then applied to the test dataset. It was asked to produce one code per input statement, as on the training set. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,259.28,620.25,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows the results it obtained. For comparison, we recall in the same table the results obtained with the same settings by training on our training split of the training corpus and testing on our test split of the training corpus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Discussion</head><p>Without surprise, recall and F-measure remain lower than precision, as on the development set, mainly because our system does not include provision for multilabel classification.</p><p>We also observe that the precision, recall and F-measure of the system did not change much (about -2pt for P, -1pt for R and -1pt for F) from the development set to the test set: this shows that our system did not overfit the training corpus.</p><p>We examined the most frequent codes in our test split as follows. Given the set of statements associated with an ICD code in the gold standard codes, we counted the number of incorrect codes in system results (false positives) for these statements. We ranked them in decreasing order of false positives and show the top 20 in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,246.63,363.71,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_6">5</ref>. Many of the top false-positive codes are among the most frequent codes (e.g., A419, R092, etc.).</p><p>The code with the largest number of errors is I619 (Hémorragie intracérébrale, sans précision [Intracerebral haemorrhage, unspecified]). This code frequently occurs (105 times in our test split) and was confused by our system 102 times (97%) with other codes. Among these it was confused 40 times with I691 (Séquelles d'hémorragie intracérébrale [Sequelae of intracerebral haemorrhage]). Table <ref type="table" coords="12,475.61,193.02,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_7">6</ref> shows the vector space representation (the top five features) of I619 and its topthree confused codes. Because of these representations, statements such as AVC hémorragique (30 occurrences in the test split), which are represented as 'avc', 'hemorrag', 'avc hemorrag', are more similar to I691 than to I619, although they miss the sequel feature which would make them really relevant for I691.</p><p>P524 (Hémorragie intracérébrale (non traumatique) du foetus et du nouveauné [Intracerebral (nontraumatic) haemorrhage of fetus and newborn]) is the second most confused code with I619. The discriminant factor for P524 with respect to I619 is that it is a perinatal diagnosis in Chapter XVI of ICD10. However, age=0 (less than 5 years old), an important feature for that ICD10 chapter, did not make it to these top five features, i.e., it has a lower tf.idf weight than the features displayed in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,252.39,338.78,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_7">6</ref>. Statements such as hémorragie cérébrale [Cerebral haemorrhage] or hémorragie intra-cérébrale [Intracerebral haemorrhage] and the like, whatever their age metadata, have therefore nearly as strong unigram similarity to I619 as to P524, and have higher bigram similarity to it. The absence in a statement of the feature age=0, which is present in all examples of P524 in the training corpus, does not prevent the IR-style classifier from considering the representation of hémorragie cérébrale (with an age different from 0) as more similar to that of P524 (which includes the age=0 feature) than to that of I619.</p><p>Finally, S062 (Lésion traumatique cérébrale diffuse [Diffuse brain injury]) is the third most confused code with I619. Its top five features also show its strong similarity to I619 and give higher weights to 'cerebral', 'hemorrag', 'intra', 'intra cerebral' than I619. Because of that, statements such as hématome intra-cérébral [Intracerebral haemorrhage] or hématome cérébral [Cerebral haemorrhage] obtain a representation whose 'cerebral', 'intra', and 'intra cerebral' features get a higher similarity score to S062 than to I619. The discriminant factor for S062 is the fact that in the context of Chapter XIX of ICD10 (traumas, poisoning, etc.), it must be a traumatic lesion. In the CépiDc death certificates, this factor is often present not in the statement itself but in its context, i.e., in the other statements of the same certificate. Contrast for instance hématome intra-cérébral in Examples 1 and 2 below, each of which shows an excerpt of a death certificate as annotated in the gold standard data. In Example 1 there is no specific context, therefore it is coded as a cardiovascular diagnosis (I619); in Example 2 the problem in Statement 2 is caused by a fall (chute in Statement 3), therefore it is coded as a traumatic injury (S062). Example 1. 77938;2012;2;75;2;1;détresse respiratoire;3;5;1-1;détresse respiratoire;J960 This analysis of the top false positive codes for I619 gives an idea of the types of shortcomings of our method and outlines directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Future work</head><p>Improving precision. We observed that some discriminant features were not given sufficient weight in the classification. While using more state-of-the-art IR scores and similarities such as BM25 or language models might improve upon tf.idf and Cosine, we believe that using a more classical machine learning classifier based on individual training examples (instead of global pseudo-documents as we did in an Information Retrieval style) might lead to more important changes. Since our submission, we also experimented with various classifiers, among which Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, which obtained a precision of 0.89-0.91 on mono-codes (+15pt) with only tokens as features.</p><p>The context of a statement, i.e., the other statements of the same certificate, may provide important information in some cases, as we observed in our error analysis. We plan to incorporate this context as additional features for classification. Another possibility will be to use such features in a reranking stage, as we already started to do with our chapter classifier.</p><p>Improving recall. The main cause of the low recall of our classifier is that it only proposes one code for each statement, whereas some statements may lead to multiple codes. A possible direction to address it is to select the top-ranked code, then to greedily remove the tokens which support it, and to iterate on the remaining tokens as long as codes are proposed with sufficiently high confidence.</p><p>Adding a more traditional strategy based on simple dictionary matching would be yet another way to identify sequences of diagnoses in a statement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,235.88,137.86,244.71,7.86;6,134.77,148.81,345.82,7.86;6,134.77,159.77,345.83,7.86;6,134.77,170.73,186.45,7.86"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>-10k1tmbt: bigrams and trigrams. -10k1tmbts: bigrams and trigrams; add standardized tokens to training documents. -10k1tmbt4: 1-4-grams and meta-information. -10k1tmbt45: 1-5-grams and meta-information. -10k1tmbt4i: 1-4grams and meta-information, use ICD labels.</figDesc></figure>
