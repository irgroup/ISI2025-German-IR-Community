<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper we describe the participation of InfoLab in the patient-centred information retrieval task of the CLEF eHealth 2016 lab. We analyse the performance of several query expansion strategies using different sources of terms and different methods to select the terms to be added to the original query. One of the strategies uses pseudo relevance feedback for term selection. The other strategies use external sources such as Wikipedia articles and definitions from the UMLS Metathesaurus for term selection. In the end, readability metrics such as SMOG, FOG and Flesch-Kincaid were used to re-rank the documents retrieved using the expanded queries. As the relevance and readability assessments are not available we can't make any conclusion regarding the results of our approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A survey conducted by Susannah Fox <ref type="bibr" coords="1,299.42,548.52,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> shows that 80% of internet users in the U.S. look online for health information, most frequently for information about a specific disease or medical problem. One of the most used techniques in this area of information retrieval is the query expansion. Query expansion (or term expansion) is the process of supplementing the original query with additional terms, and it can be considered as a method for improving retrieval performance <ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.77,620.25,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This process might contribute to overcome one of the biggest difficulties for users in the search for health information: health consumers limited knowledge of medical terminology. This lack of knowledge influences the formulation of queries and the users expectations regarding the retrieved documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Task description</head><p>The 2016 CLEF eHealth Information Retrieval Task 3 Patient-Centred Information Retrieval<ref type="foot" coords="2,194.78,179.66,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">3</ref> aims to evaluate systems that support people in understanding and searching for their health information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,324.12,193.19,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is possible by evaluating a ranked list of documents from the provided test collection as a response to patients queries. This is done through a TREC-style evaluation process, using the provided test collection. This task is split into three subTasks: ad-hoc search, query variation and multilingual search <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.48,241.01,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We participated in the ad-hoc search and query variation subTasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Document Collection</head><p>The collection for Task 3 is the ClueWeb12 B13 Dataset<ref type="foot" coords="2,389.54,307.66,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">4</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.32,309.23,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This collection was generated by taking the 10 million ClueWeb09 URLs that had the highest PageRank scores, and then removing any page that was not in the top 90% of pages least likely to be spam, according to the Waterloo spam scores. These URLs were used as a starting point for a crawl which excluded any page that appeared in the blacklist provided by a URL blacklist service<ref type="foot" coords="2,401.79,367.43,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">5</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Queries</head><p>Queries from the Patient-Centred Information Retrieval task explore real health consumer posts from health web forums <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.74,437.23,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. They were extracted from posts on the askDocs forum of Reddit, and presented to query generators. Query generators had to create queries based on what they read in the initial user post, making several variations for the same condition. The Linux program aspell was used to correct some misspellings on the English queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">System description</head><p>The organization of the CLEF eHealth Lab used Terrier and Indri to index the provided collection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.49,553.27,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In our work we chose to use Terrier. Terrier implements state-of-the-art indexing and retrieval functionalities, and provides an ideal platform for the rapid development and evaluation of large-scale retrieval applications. The Terrier index was provided to all the participants through a virtual machine on the Azure platform, doing so every team has access to same index allowing a easier comparison between different groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Retrieval Approaches</head><p>Query expansion is the main approach used in this report. Query expansion (or term expansion) is the process of supplementing the original query with additional terms, and it can be considered as a method for improving retrieval performance <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.99,181.04,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Different sources and methodologies will be used to identify which terms will be added by the query expansion. In this section we present our approaches for Task 3: Patient-Centred Information Retrieval starting with the baseline, continuing with several query expansion methodologies and ending with the readability re-ranking. For all approaches we use the weighting model used in the baseline. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,427.50,465.67,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we present a summary of our query expansion approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline</head><p>We used BM25 term weighting model to score and rank medical documents. Okapi BM25 (BM stands for Best BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Sparck Jones, and others <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,591.76,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>For a given query Q, the relevance score of a document D based on the BM25 term weighting model is expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,177.88,636.93,298.47,30.97">score(D, Q) = n i=1 IDF (q i ) T F (q i , D).(k1 + 1) T F (q i , D) + k1.(1 -b + b. |D| avgdl ) (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,476.35,647.34,4.24,8.74">)</formula><p>where TF is the number of occurrences of a given term q i in the document D. |D| the size of the document in words, avgdl the average size of a document. k1 anda b are free parameters, usually chosen, in absence of an advanced optimization, as <ref type="bibr" coords="4,211.20,154.86,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,254.36,179.33,226.23,8.74">k1 ∈ [1.2; 2.0] b = 0.75 (2)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Pseudo Relevance Feedback</head><p>Pseudo Relevance Feedback is a method of query expansion that uses the document collection in which it runs as the source for its terms <ref type="bibr" coords="4,399.12,242.48,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In this method the top documents returned by the baseline are used to modify the query by reweighting the existing query terms and by adding terms that appear useful and by deleting terms that do not. This process creates a new query which resembles the relevant documents more than the original query does <ref type="bibr" coords="4,390.97,290.30,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Terrier provides two different models to apply the pseudo relevance feedback method: the Bose-Einstein and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence. The Bose-Einstein model calculates the weight of terms, as following <ref type="bibr" coords="4,393.62,326.31,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,210.96,347.29,269.63,23.22">w(t) = tf x .log 2 ( 1 + P n (t) P n (t) ) + log 2 (1 + P n (t))<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,281.99,378.08,198.60,22.31">P n (t) = tf c N<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where tf x is the frequency of the query term t in the top-ranked documents, tf c is the frequency of term t in the collection, and N is the number of documents in the collection <ref type="bibr" coords="4,208.67,430.01,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The Kullback-Liebler Divergence computes the divergence between the probability distribution of terms in the whole collection and in the top ranked documents obtained using the original query <ref type="bibr" coords="4,392.53,453.92,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The most likely terms to expand the query are those with a high probability in the top ranked set and low probability in the whole collection. For the term t this divergence is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,232.26,498.61,248.33,26.60">KLD(t) = [P r (t) -P c (t)].log f (t) N R P c (t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P r (t) is the probability of t estimated from the top retrieved documents relative to a query (R). P c (t) is the probability of t estimated using the whole collection <ref type="bibr" coords="4,179.04,556.96,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>For this approach two runs were created to identify which one of this models provides better results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Query expansion using the Medical Text Indexer</head><p>The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) combines human NLM Index Section expertise and Natural Language Processing technology to curate the biomedical literature more efficiently and consistently. MTI is the main product of the Indexing Initiative project and has been providing indexing recommendations based on the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary since 2002 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,446.29,130.95,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Queries were processed by MTI which linked the text from the query to the MeSH vocabulary resulting in additional related concepts. The identified concepts are likely to be important for the retrieval process than other information in the query. However the MTI results are machine generated which, depending on the query, could result in irrelevant concepts.</p><p>In this approach, we appended all the concepts identified by the MTI to the original query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Query expansion using Wikipedia</head><p>Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, written collaboratively by the people who use it. Many people are constantly improving Wikipedia, making thousands of changes per hour <ref type="foot" coords="5,172.86,284.32,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">6</ref> . This makes Wikipedia an enormous source of information likely to contain medical terms in lay language. As shown in the work of Laurent and Vickers <ref type="bibr" coords="5,169.49,309.81,14.60,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, the English Wikipedia is a prominent source of online health information compared to other online health information providers like MedlinePlus. Using Wikipedia as a base, we defined two methods to get terms for the query expansion process. One of the methods extracts the most frequent terms from Wikipedia articles. The other uses Wikipedia as a directed graph to identify similar articles and then extracts terms from the titles of these articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Term Frequency</head><p>The MediaWiki action API is a web service that provides a convenient access to wiki features, data, and meta-data over HTTP, via an URL <ref type="foot" coords="5,155.80,420.57,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">7</ref> . This API was used to find the articles that best match the concepts obtained through the MTI.</p><p>An analysis of the obtained Wikipedia pages allowed us to identify some that were not health-related. To minimize this, we decided to exclude the pages not containing an infobox similar to the one presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,403.05,469.97,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref>  <ref type="foot" coords="5,408.03,468.40,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">8</ref> which contains information about the category of the page (e.g. anatomy, disease, drug).</p><p>This approach had several variants. We chose the 5, 10 and 15 most frequent terms of each article. In addition we considered (1) all articles found with the MTI concepts and (2) only the articles considered health-related using the strategy defined above.</p><p>Link Analysis As shown in the work of Almasari <ref type="bibr" coords="5,353.56,558.40,14.60,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Wikipedia is a hypertext network in which each article can refer to other Wikipedia article using hyperlinks. Considering only internal links, which are links that target other Wikipedia article it is possible to represent Wikipedia articles as a directed graph G(A;L) of articles A connected by links L. L is the set of all the Incoming and Outgoing Links from the article A. Each concept from MTI was used to search for a Wikipedia article which served as a starting point. Using Wikipedia directed graph it is possible to retrieve the articles which referred and are referred by the first article. This method returns thousands of articles that aren't relevant to the expansion process because even if they're referred by the first article they might not be in the same category. To solve this issue we used the Jaccard similarity coefficient. This coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets <ref type="bibr" coords="6,462.33,446.55,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The Incoming (I) and Outgoing (O) Links were used as the sets for the Jaccard coefficient.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="6,268.90,500.68,211.70,22.31">J(I, O) = |I O| |I O|<label>(6)</label></formula><p>We used the Java Wikipedia Library (JWPL) 9 to compute this coefficient. The JWPL is a free, Java-based application programming interface that allows access to all the information in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" coords="6,325.16,565.53,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This library used a Wikipedia dump from March 2016.</p><p>For this approach we added to the original query all the titles of articles that had a Jaccard similarity coefficient greater than 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. We considered one alternative using all articles found with the MTI concepts and another using only the articles considered health-related using the strategy defined above. 9 https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-jwpl/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Query expansion using MedlinePlus</head><p>MedlinePlus<ref type="foot" coords="7,188.37,138.17,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_6">10</ref> is the National Institutes of Health Web site for patients, their families and friends. Produced by the National Library of Medicine, the worlds largest medical library, it brings information about diseases, conditions, and wellness issues in lay language.</p><p>Using the information on the infobox (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,345.72,187.73,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), obtained through the search of the MTI concepts on the Wikipedia, it is possible to access the corresponding MedlinePlus page. MedlinePlus pages are generally splitted in different sections with relevant information about the searched concept. The sections that were considered most relevant for the query expansion process were the Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Possible Complications and Alternative Names sections.</p><p>We testes several variants of this method. We chose the top 5, 10 and 15 most frequent terms on each of the above mentioned sections. The structure and size of the Alternative Names section made us include all the terms included in this section. We also made a run with only the terms from the Alternative Names.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Query expansion using the ICD-10</head><p>ICD-10<ref type="foot" coords="7,166.45,345.39,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_7">11</ref> is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. The code set allows more than 14,400 different codes and permits the tracking of many new diagnoses.</p><p>The approach using ICD-10 is similar to the one used in MedlinePlus taking advantage on the contents of the infobox from Wikipedia. The ICD-10 page contains not only information about the search concept but also about other diseases or symptoms related to the initial concept displayed in a hierarchy. This related information is used as a source of terms to use on the query expansion process.</p><p>We chose the top 5, 10 and 15 most frequent terms of an ICD-10 page to append to the original query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Query expansion using Latent Dirichlet Allocation over Wikipedia</head><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus. The basic idea is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words <ref type="bibr" coords="7,431.61,590.06,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,134.77,602.01,4.98,8.74">3</ref> shows an example of LDA applied to a text, generating four topics for the text and a set of words which represent each topic. These distributions seem to capture some of the underlying topics in the corpus. Each word on the text tends to peak towards one of the possible topic values, the words are color coded according to the topics they represent. For this approach an implementation of LDA for Java (JGibbLDA) was used to generate topics from texts related to each query. These texts were the Wikipedia articles obtained through the MediaWiki API using the MTI concepts as search terms.</p><p>In this approach we tried different combinations of number of topics and number of words to to identify which one contributes the most. We chose a combination of 3 topics with 1, 5 and 10 words, and 1, 5 and 10 topics with 5 words.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,154.40,495.53,4.13,7.89">3</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Query expansion using the Unified Medical Language System</head><p>The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine. The UMLS integrates over 2 million names for 900,000 concepts from more than 60 families of biomedical vocabularies, as well as 12 million relations among these concepts. Vocabularies integrated in the UMLS Metathesaurus include the NCBI taxonomy, Gene Ontology, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), OMIM and the Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base.</p><p>The UMLS Metathesaurus has a REST API that provides access to its information. Using this API it is possible to extract terms to be used in the expansion using the definitions in UMLS related to the MTI concepts.</p><p>We chose the top 5, 10 and 15 most frequent terms on the UMLS definitions to be added to the original query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9">Readability</head><p>Readability metrics measure the difficulty of understanding a passage of text. Readability metrics are often based on features such as the average number of syllables per word, and words per sentence. These features ignore concept difficulty and are based on assumptions about writing style that may not hold in all environments.</p><p>There are many readability metrics. SMOG, FOG and Flesch-Kinciad are three of the most widely used readability metrics. They all estimate the educational grade level necessary to understand a document <ref type="bibr" coords="9,375.50,298.47,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>SMOG Readability Formula estimates the years of education a person needs to understand a piece of writing. McLaughlin created this formula as an improvement over other readability formulas <ref type="bibr" coords="9,321.21,334.33,15.50,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and defined it as: SM OG = 3 + N umber Of P olysyllable W ords In 30 Sentences <ref type="bibr" coords="9,467.86,367.05,12.73,8.74" target="#b6">(7)</ref> If the document is longer than 30 sentences, the first 10 sentences, the middle 10 sentences, and the last 10 sentences are used. If the document has fewer than 30 sentences, some rules and a conversion table are used to calculate the grade level. The SMOG measure tends to give higher values than other readability metrics <ref type="bibr" coords="9,169.71,435.64,14.61,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The Gunning Fog Index Readability Formula, or simply called FOG Index, is attributed to American textbook publisher, Robert Gunning. Gunning observed that most high school graduates were unable to read. Much of this reading problem was a writing problem. His opinion was that newspapers and business documents were full of fog and unnecessary complexity. In 1952, Gunning created an easy-to-use Fog Index defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="9,247.00,531.28,229.35,8.74">F OG = 0.4 (ASL + P HW ) (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="9,476.35,531.28,4.24,8.74">)</formula><p>Where ASL is the Average Sentence Length (number of words divided by the number of sentences) and PHW is the Percentage of Hard Words (words of three or more syllables). The FOG metric is considered suitable for secondary and older primary age groups.</p><p>The Flesch-Kincaid readability metric was developed under contract to the U.S. Navy in 1975 by Rudolph Flesch and John Peter Kincaid. This Flesch-Kincaid formula was first used by the U.S. Army for assessing the difficulty of technical manuals in 1978 and soon after became the Department of Defense military standard. Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to require that automobile insurance policies be written at no higher than a ninth-grade level of reading difficulty, as measured by the Flesch-Kincaid formula. This is now a common requirement in many other states and for other legal documents such as insurance policies <ref type="foot" coords="10,166.65,141.33,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_8">12</ref> . The Flesch-Kincaid formula is defined as: F K = (0.39 * ASL) + (11.8 * ASW ) -15.59 <ref type="bibr" coords="10,467.86,166.81,12.73,8.74" target="#b8">(9)</ref> where ASL is the Average Sentence Length (the number of words divided by the number of sentences) and the ASW is the Average number of Syllable per Word (the number of syllables divided by the number of words).</p><p>A re-rank method was developed to combine the readability metrics with the relevance scores from Terrier. Three different formulas were used to combine these values. The last formula was proposed by Zuccon and Koopman <ref type="bibr" coords="10,434.34,244.51,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, where an user is characterized by a readability threshold th and every document that has a readability score below th is considered readable, while documents with readability above th are considered unreadable. </p><p>In this approach we re-rank each run with one of the readability metrics and one of the above combination formulas <ref type="bibr" coords="10,306.99,389.53,65.04,8.74">(10, 11 and 12)</ref>, which generates a total of 9 different variants for each of the previous runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>We participated in two subTasks: ad-hoc search and query variation. For the first subTask each query was treated individually ignoring all the query variations. For the second subTask each group of query variations was treated as one query. In this section we present the evaluation results of each approach compared with the baseline for the two subTasks. We also show the evaluation results for the submitted runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Submitted Runs</head><p>For Task 3: Patient-Centred Information Retrieval we could only submit up to 3 runs with the first one being the baseline run. For the other runs we chose to submit the Wikipedia Link Analysis run with a Jaccard similarity coefficient above 0.50 using health-related Wikipedia articles and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation run with 3 topics and 5 words. This runs were re-ranked using the SMOG readability metric and the formula 12.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,233.37,395.11,148.61,7.89;3,195.29,225.33,224.78,155.01"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

In addition, we would like to incorporate readability metrics that weren't based on sentence lengths or polysyllabic words but were based in concepts.</p></div>			</div>
