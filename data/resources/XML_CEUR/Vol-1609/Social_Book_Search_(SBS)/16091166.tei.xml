<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes our participation in the interactive track (ChiSwe Group) of the Social Book Search (SBS) lab organized at CLEF 2016 <ref type="foot" coords="1,343.13,492.60,3.48,6.26" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . This is our first participation in CLEF SBS interactive track. Our group conducted all the experiments in China and the participants' native language in our group is Chinese. It has been of recent interest to explore the search behavior of multi-lingual users <ref type="bibr" coords="1,353.11,531.69,11.61,9.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We noticed using the data set from CLEF SBS 2015, Skov and Bogers examined the differences in search behavior between native speakers and non-native speakers of English <ref type="bibr" coords="1,372.79,557.01,11.79,9.94" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. But surprisingly, their results showed few significant differences in search behaviors between native and non-native speakers. Other researchers had found that searching in a foreign language requires significantly longer time, more query reformulations, and more websites viewed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,487.90,594.93,11.94,9.94" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,499.84,594.93,7.96,9.94" target="#b3">4]</ref>. For example, Hansen and Karlgren concluded that their hypotheses included results for assessment in a foreign, albeit near-native competence, language would be more time-consuming and taxing than those for the first language. Assessing texts in English (27 seconds average assessment time per document) took longer than for Swedish (20 seconds) (p &gt; 0:95; Mann Whitney U) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,261.17,658.20,11.79,9.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. During the experiments in China, our participants have commented that they have difficulties in using the English interface of the search systems and understanding the requirements of search tasks. Since this is the first time that a significant number of Chinese searchers participated in this experiment and English is the language used for the search system, we think it might be interesting to explore what role the native language plays in interactive social book search. Therefore, we divided all the participants in three groups: Chinese native speakers, English native speakers and native speakers of other languages.</p><p>Our main research question is: What are the influences of native languages on search behaviors and search experience? Specifically, we will examine four specific RQs:</p><p>RQ1. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>A total of 112 participants participated in this year's SBS interactive track experiment. The search log data and questionnaire data include participants' demographic information, search activity log, and answers to the questionnaires regarding search experience and engagements. We divided the participants into three groups according to their mother tongues, and the distributions of the number of participants by their native languages are as follows: 29 native Chinese speakers 27 native English speakers, and 56 native speakers of other languages. In order to answer our research questions, we analyzed participants' answers to the questionnaires and the activity log data. In each experiment, the participants were required to perform at least one search task (task 1), and they also had the option to perform a second task (task 2). For task 1, two types of search tasks were designed in SBS interactive track to investigate the impact of task types on the participants' search behaviors in social book search: focused and open tasks. For search behaviors and usefulness judgments on different search tools, we first compare the differences by three groups of searchers for all search tasks; and then in order to compare the differences between two types of tasks, we only selected task 1 for analysis, and compare the differences by three groups of searchers under each type of tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Search time</head><p>We first compared the task completion time among three groups of participants. The tests of normality of task completion time in task 1 and task 2 showed neither of them was normal distributed, therefore, we conducted Kruskal-Wallis Tests on task completion time. Results show that there were significant differences among participants with different native languages (p&lt;0.001 for both task1 and task 2) as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,411.19,187.84,4.14,9.94" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Then post-hoc analysis was conducted to compare the differences among them. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,157.82,349.51,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, for both task 1 and task 2, Chinese speakers spent significantly longer time to complete the tasks than the other two groups of participants. On average, Chinese participants spent 17.79 minutes to complete task 1 on average, whereas English participants spent 8.77 minutes and other language participants spent 8.41 minutes. For task 2, Chinese participants spent 7.23 minutes to complete on average, whereas English participants spent 3.6 minutes on average, and other language participants spent 3.92 minutes on average. Since only task 1 contains task type information, we then focused on task 1 to further examine whether different language participants have any differences in task completion time in each of the two task types. When only focused tasks were considered, users' completion time also showed significant difference among three groups of participants (p=0.011), as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,459.43,366.07,4.14,9.94" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. The post hoc analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,259.85,661.20,4.60,9.94">2</ref>) showed that native Chinese speakers (Median=24.62 min) had significantly longer time completion time than native English speaker (Median=10.56 min) and other language speakers (Median=10.16 min). When only open tasks were considered, users' completion time also showed significant difference among three groups of participants (p=0.03). The post hoc analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,356.59,175.12,4.60,9.94">3</ref>) showed that native Chinese speakers had significantly longer time completion time (Median=13.42 min) than native English speakers (Median=2.61 min) and other language speakers (Median=6.9 min).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Number of Interactions</head><p>From the activity log data, we extracted the following indicators of users' book search, browsing and annotation behavior:  Task level: number of books selected, switching between the above modes (showlayout)  Search: number of queries issued, reset search  Browsing: browse, add a facet, remove a facet, show item, view metadata, similar books, paginate (next page)  Book bag: add to bookbag, remove from bookbag, number of books selected, annotate item. For each task, we extracted the number of times a user performed the above activities. We tested the distribution of the above indicators, and results show that none of them are normally distributed. So we conducted K-Wallis tests to see if any of the above variables shows significant differences across the three language groups (native Chinese speaker, native English speaker, and native speaker of other languages). Table <ref type="table" coords="5,431.59,420.31,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_5">3</ref> shows a summary of the test results: Results show that there is a significant difference between the three language groups in terms of how many books they selected for each task. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,156.26,541.17,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows that the Chinese group selected the most number of books, while the English group selected the least number of books for the tasks.</p><p>Switching between search, browsing and review. Results show that there is a significant difference between the three language groups in terms of how many times they have switched between search, browsing and review modes. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,158.42,395.83,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows that the Chinese group seemed to have switched most between search, browse and review mode of the system whereas the other two groups seemed similar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Search</head><p>Results showed that there was no significant difference across three language groups in terms of number of queries issued and number of times users reset search. Browsing and bookbag activities seemed more different among the three groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Browsing</head><p>Show item and view metadata. Results show that there is a significant difference between the three language groups in terms of how many times they viewed the metadata of a book. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,156.38,552.57,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows that the Chinese group viewed more items and more metadata than the other two groups. There is no significant difference in other browsing activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Bookbag Use</head><p>Book annotation. Results show that there is a significant difference between the three language groups in terms of how many books they annotated. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,156.62,382.99,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows that the Chinese group annotated more than the other two groups, while the other group annotated least number of books (although they selected more books than the native English speakers).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">Task Types</head><p>We also compared task types (open vs. focused) in addition to native language groups. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,124.82,473.13,5.52,9.94" target="#tab_6">4</ref> shows the results. The results seemed to show that there is a different pattern in terms of number of queries issued by each language group for focused task and open task. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,433.27,273.04,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_6">8</ref> shows the results. For the focused task, Chinese users issued a lot more queries than the other group whereas English and other speakers issued similar number of queries. For the open task, English speakers issued least number of queries whereas Chinese and other speakers issued similar number of queries.</p><p>For the open task, Chinese users seemed to use more "similar books" feature, relying on system recommendation whereas the other two groups did not use this feature as much.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Users' Perceptions of the Usefulness of Search Tools</head><p>After participants completed each of search tasks, there was a post-task questionnaire to ask about the usefulness of each search tools used during searching. In this part, we compared participants' judgments of the usefulness among three native language groups. Since we are interested to see if there is any difference between focused and open tasks, we only focused in users' evaluations in task 1 in this part. Similarly, Kruskal-Wallis Tests were conducted for task 1, and then specifically for focused and open tasks. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,212.69,353.95,4.14,9.94" target="#tab_7">5</ref>, when searching for task 1, users have significant differences in two tools among three groups: browse individual books and search results. The post-hoc demonstrated that English searchers rated browse individual books significantly lower than other language searchers, and Chinese searchers were not significantly different with the other two groups of searchers, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,353.83,404.47,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_7">9</ref>. For search results page, the post-hoc showed that English searchers rated significantly lower than the other two groups of searchers, and there is no significant difference between Chinese and other language searchers, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,257.57,442.39,9.20,9.94" target="#fig_0">10</ref>.  When only "focused" tasks were considered, two tools showed significant differences: meta.data.description, and search.box. For meta.data.descrpition, the English searchers rated significantly lower than the other two groups, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,444.87,472.53,8.88,9.94" target="#fig_8">11</ref>. For search box, Chinese searcher rated significantly more useful than the other two groups of searchers, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,199.22,497.73,9.14,9.94" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Search Engagements</head><p>After participants had completed both search tasks, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their engagements for the search system. The engagement questionnaire consisted of 31 questions representing six groups of engagement factors: aesthetics, endurability, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and perceived usefulness. Since the website was designed in English language only, we could hypothesize that participants with different native languages, especially whether native English speakers, native Chinese speakers and other speaker had engaged in searching using this system at different levels, due to different language (English) proficiency levels.</p><p>First of all, we tested the normality of the engagement variables, and found none of them were normal distributed. Therefore, for the comparison among three groups of participants, we used Kruskal-Wallis Tests. The results are shows in Table <ref type="table" coords="13,401.23,589.29,4.08,9.94" target="#tab_8">6</ref>. Among all 31 engagement items, 7 of them were found to be significantly different among the three groups of participants: en1 (Exploring this website was worthwhile), en4 (My exploration experience was rewarding), fa4 (When exploring, I lost track of the world around me), fa5 (The time I spent exploring just slipped away), fa6 (I was absorbed in exploring), fi1 (I was really drawn into my exploration task), pu1 (I felt frustrated while exploring this website). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>This notepaper presents the preliminary results on the influences of native languages in search behaviors and search experiences in the context of interactive social book search. Earlier studies in the proceeding of CLEF SBS 2015 did not find many differences between native and non-native speakers of English. This year, we joined in CLEF SBS interactive track, and we think it is reasonable to examine the difference among native Chinese speakers with native English speakers and other European languages. In general the results show a series of differences among the three groups of participants. The results show that Chinese searchers devoted more search efforts in searching, i.e. spent longest time to complete search tasks, selected the most number of books, have switched most between search, browse and review model of the search system, viewed more items and more metadata, and annotated more than English and other language speakers. This is consistent with the results in <ref type="bibr" coords="16,514.90,570.81,11.70,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Comparatively, English searchers had spent least search efforts among the three groups of searchers. Besides language effects, another possible reason for this is that all the Chinese speakers conducted searching in the lab mode in this experiment, and all other participants conducted searching remotely. Since we do not have any Chinese speakers who participated remotely, there is no way for us to filter out the effect of participation modes in this analysis. We should consider having more Chinese participants remotely in the future to further validate this result. With respect to the usefulness of search tools, few significant differences were found. For the two search tools that showed significant differences, i.e.</p><p>browse_individual_books and search_results, English speakers had the lowest score of usefulness among three groups of searchers. For the engagement comparison, seven measures were found to be significantly different among three groups of searchers. In general, English searchers had the lowest score in the engagement with the search system, and Chinese searchers had the highest score in the engagement. We should further explore the data to explain such phenomena. One possible explanation is that Chinese searchers have devoted most efforts in searching, so they tended not to rate the system with the lowest measure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,167.78,653.26,319.52,7.24;3,124.75,450.53,242.65,194.25"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
