<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Social Book Search (SBS) Tracks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,302.17,424.97,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[2]</ref> was introduced by INEX in 2010 with the purpose of evaluate approaches for supporting users in searching collections of books based on book metadata and associated user-generated content. Since new issues have emerged. This year, a new track is proposed called Mining Track. This track includes two tasks: classification task and linking task. As part of our work, we focuse on the linking task, which consists to recognize book titles in posts and link them to their unique book ID. The goal is to identify which books are mentioned in posts. It is not necessary to identify the exact phrase that refers to book but to get the book that match the title in the collection. The SBS task builds on a training corpus of topics which consists of a set of 200 threads (3619 posts) labeled with touchstones which allow can be used by members to easily identify books they mention in the topic thread, giving other readers of the thread direct access to a book record in LibraryThing<ref type="foot" coords="1,427.89,566.86,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (LT), with associated ISBNs and links to collection. These posts are expressed in natural language made by users of LT forums. A data set contains book IDs, basic title and author metadata for each book. In addition, it is possible to use the document collection used in the Suggestion Track, which can be used as additional book metadata. This document collection consists of book descriptions for 2.8 million books.</p><p>In our contribution at SBS task, we use an approach inspired by the works on the bibliographical references detection in Scholarly Publications <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.40,131.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. We propose a supervised approach based on classification process combined with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to detect book titles. Then, we use the Levenshtein distance to link books to their unique book ID. We submit 5 runs in which we compare several variations of selected features provide by CRF, of the combination of detected tags (book titles and author names) and of the factor taken by the Levenshtein distance. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The following section describes our approach. In section 3, we describe the submitted runs. We present the obtained results in section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Supervised Approach for book detection</head><p>In this section, we present our supervised approach dedicated to book titles detection and link to their unique book ID. Firstly, we define a classification process with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Secondly, we describe the implementation of the CRF used. Thirdly, we present the use of Levenshtein distance to link books to their unique book ID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Retrieving posts with book titles using SVM</head><p>In context of online forums, we have a wide variety of themes that are addressed. So, it is necessary to conduct a pre-filtering on verbose queries for identify queries with book titles. We choose to use a supervised classification based on SVM. We define two classes: "bibliographic field" versus "no bibliographic field". We establish a manual training set extracts randomly from the threads provided for the task. The class "bibliographic field" contains 184 posts and the class "no bibliographic field" 153 posts. For the SVM implementation, we use SVMLight<ref type="foot" coords="2,476.12,460.89,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,474.42,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Regarding the settings, we use Weka<ref type="foot" coords="2,290.37,484.80,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> in order to establish a list of the most characteristic words of our classes, we use as attributes. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,394.10,498.33,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of this list. The first column designates the score of "Recursive Feature Elimi- nation" (RFE) and the second column refers to word. This list is obtained by the algorithm InfoGainAttribute which reduces a bias of multi-valued attributes. After several tests, we decided to use 1 as a minimum occurrence frequency of terms combined with a list from which we have removed the words with score RFE equal 0. This list is composed of 2182 words. We conduct 10-fold crossvalidations to assess how the results generalize to a set of data. We obtain an accuracy of 80.69% with a recall of 100.00% and a precision of 78.45%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Authors and book titles detection based on CRF</head><p>As part of our work, we choose to use an approach based on CRF. We establish a training set extracts randomly from the threads provide for the task. We manually annotated 133 posts in which we marked both book titles and author names. In total, we annotated 264 book titles and 203 author names. For constructing our CRF, we use several features presented in tables 1 and 2. For the CRF implementation, we use the tool Wapiti<ref type="foot" coords="3,332.82,286.19,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . Main characteristics exploited in the literature for the automatic annotation of references are based on a number of observations such as lexical or morphological characteristics, both on the fields and the words contained in the fields. Drawing a parallel between the task of named entities detection and the analysis of bibliographic references, we are able to extract more useful information in the characterization fields and words contained in the fields. As part of our work, we decide to use a typology of features inspired by the literature.</p><p>-Contextual features: We add several features using the other tokens around the current one as three preceding and three following tokens. We use grammatical properties provides by a POS Tagger<ref type="foot" coords="3,351.67,412.71,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . We use a natural language parser which provide structure of sentences. The latter two features, allow us to establish patterns of syntactic which define, independently words, potential anchors with greater portability. lexical and syntactic characteristics. The morphological features that were selected to characterize the shape of the tokens. The locational features have been selected to define the position of the fields in a sequence. The lexical features have been selected to use lists of predefined words but also linguistic category of words. And lastly, the punctuation features. From these characteristics we construct vectors for each word. Following the classification, we get a list of posts containing book titles potentially. Then, our CRF allows us to annotate the area referring to book titles or author names.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Mapping to book Ids</head><p>Once book titles or author names detection carried out, we use the Levenshtein distance for link books to their unique book ID. Just for recall, Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other. As part of our work, we use two variations of the Levenshtein distance: either the length of the shortest alignment between the sequences is taken as factor, or the length of the longer one. For each book title found, we compare it with the whole of book titles extracts from the collection. For each book title, we obtained a list of the books sorted by normalized Levenshtein distance, so that the results of several distance measures can be meaningfully compared. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,303.12,503.36,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents the best three results obtained for the book entitled "The Old Man". For each book title, we keep the best result which is close to 1. Then, we retrieve the unique ID of the most probable best book. If an author name is located at a maximum distance of four words, we aggregate it. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,410.29,633.20,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a query which contains both book title and author name. Then, figure presents the result obtained for the input "Timothy Findley The Last of the Crazy People".  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Runs</head><p>We submitted 5 runs for the linking task of Mining track. For each run, we use only the data set which contains book IDs, basic title and author metadata per book. Once the classification process and the annotation process done, we link books at the post level by their unique LibraryThing work ID. Concerning a book which occurs multiple times in the same post, we keep only the first occurrence. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,218.86,407.91,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows an example of the second post of the thread 16512. For each post, we have the content of the post, the name of the user, the thread id as well as the date and time.   After the classification process and the annotation process, we retrieve each book title and we compare it with the whole of the titles presents within the data set. This comparison is carried out by the Levenshtein distance set to the length of the shortest alignment between the sequences taken as factor. -B V2:</p><p>After the classification process and the annotation process, we retrieve each book title and we compare it with the whole of the titles presents within the data set.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we presented our contribution for the INEX 2016 Social Book Search Track. In the 5 submitted runs, we tested several supervised approaches dedicated to book detection. Our results present better performance with the aggregation of author names. Moreover, the Levenshtein distance set to the length of the longer alignment between the sequences taken as factor give better results than the shortest alignment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,180.45,593.80,254.45,7.89"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
