<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Domain-specific retrieval is an interesting task, one in which we access bibliographic notices (usually composed of a title and an abstract) extracted from two German social science sources and one Russian corpus. The records in these notices also contain manually assigned keywords extracted from a controlled vocabulary by librarians who are knowledgeable of the discipline to which the indexed articles belong. These descriptors should be helpful in improving document surrogates and consequently the extraction of more pertinent information, while also discarding irrelevant abstracts. Access to the underlying thesaurus would also improve retrieval performance.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the main characteristics of the GIRT-4 (written in the German and English languages) and ISISS (Russian) test-collections. Section 3 outlines the main aspects of our stopword lists and light stemming procedures, along with the IR models used in our experiments. Section 4 explains different blind query expansion approaches and evaluates their use with the available corpora. Section 5 provides our official runs and results.</p><p>("&lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-DE&gt;"), 2.02 classification terms ("&lt;CLASSIFICATION-TEXT-DE&gt;"), and 2.42 methodological terms ("&lt;METHOD-TEXT-DE&gt;" or "&lt;METHOD-TERM-DE&gt;"). The manually assigned descriptors are extracted from the controlled list known as the "Thesaurus for the Social Sciences". Finally, associated with each record is a unique identifier ("&lt;DOCNO&gt;"). <ref type="bibr" coords="2,280.68,100.41,50.39,8.43" target="#b8">Kluck (2004)</ref> provides a more complete description of this corpus. The above-mentioned German collection was translated into British English, mainly by professional translators whose native language was English. Included in all English records is a translated title (listed under "&lt;TITLE-EN&gt;" in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,129.12,89.85,3.42,8.43">2</ref>), manually assigned descriptors ("&lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-EN&gt;"), classification terms ("&lt;CLASSIFICATION-TEXT-EN&gt;") and methodological terms ("&lt;METHOD-TERM-EN&gt;"). Abstracts however were not always translated (in fact they are available for only around 15% of the English records).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;DOC&gt;</head><p>In addition to this bilingual corpus, we may also access the GIRT thesaurus, containing 10,623 entries (all including both the &lt;GERMAN&gt; and &lt;GERMAN-CAPS&gt;) tags together with 9,705 English translations. It also contains 2,947 &lt;BROADER-TERM&gt; relationships and 2,853 &lt;NARROWER-TERM&gt; links. The synonym relationship between terms is expressed through &lt;USE-INSTEAD&gt; (2,153) links, &lt;RELATED-TERM&gt; (1,528) or <ref type="bibr" coords="3,196.03,169.65,14.97,8.43">263)</ref>.</p><p>As a third language, we access bibliographic records written in the Russian language composed of the ISISS (Russian Economic and Social Science) bibliographic data collection (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,398.52,196.53,4.67,8.43">3</ref> for an example of a record extracted from the Russian collection). Using a pattern similar to that of the other two corpora, records include a title ("&lt;TITLE-RU&gt;" in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,208.44,217.77,3.42,8.43">3</ref>), sometimes an abstract ("&lt;ABSTRACT-RU&gt;"), and certain manually assigned descriptors ("&lt;KEYWORDS-RU&gt;").</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,130.08,244.65,4.67,8.43" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below lists a few statistics from these collections, showing that the German corpus has the largest size (326 MB), the English ranks second and the Russian third, both in size (81 MB) and in number of documents <ref type="bibr" coords="3,92.88,265.77,19.71,8.43">(145,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,112.59,265.77,15.77,8.43">802)</ref>. The German corpus has the larger mean size (89.71 indexing terms/article), compared to the English collection (54.86), while for the Russian corpus the mean value is clearly smaller (18.77). The English corpus includes also the CSA Sociological Abstracts (20,000 documents, 38.5 MB).</p><p>During the indexing process, we retained all pertinent sections in order to build document representatives. Additional information such as author name, publication date and the language in which the bibliographic notice was written are of less importance, particularly from an IR perspective, and thus they will be ignored in our experiments.</p><p>As shown in Appendix 2, the available topics cover various subjects (e.g., Topic #206: "Environmental justice," Topic #209: "Doping and sports," Topic #221: "Violence in schools," or Topic #211: "Shrinking cities"), and some of them may cover a relative large domain (e.g. Topic #212: "Labor market and migration"). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Indexing and IR Models</head><p>For the English, German and Russian language, we used the same stopword lists and stemmers that we selected for our previous CLEF participation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,230.64,125.13,78.53,8.43" target="#b4">(Fautsch et al., 2008)</ref>. Thus for English it was the SMART stemmer and stopword list (containing 571 items), while for the German we apply our light stemmer (available at http://www.unine.ch/info/clef/) and stopword list (603 words). For all our German experiments we also apply our decompounding algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,193.80,156.93,51.41,8.43" target="#b13">(Savoy, 2004)</ref>. For the Russian language, the stopword list contains 430 words and we apply our light stemming procedure (based on 53 rules to remove the final suffix representing gender (masculine, feminine, and neutral), number (singular, plural) and the six Russian grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative)).</p><p>In order to obtain a broader view of the relative merit of various retrieval models, we may first adopt the classical tf idf indexing scheme. In this case, the weight attached to each indexing term in a document surrogate (or in a query) combines the term's occurrence frequency (denoted tf ij for indexing term t j in document D i ) and also the inverse document frequency (denoted idf j ).</p><p>In addition to this vector-processing model, we may also consider probabilistic models such as the Okapi model (or BM25) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,135.96,263.61,88.03,8.43" target="#b11">(Robertson et al., 2000)</ref>. As a second probabilistic approach, we may implement four variants of the DFR (Divergence from Randomness) family suggested by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,311.04,274.29,116.84,8.43" target="#b1">Amati &amp; van Rijsbergen (2002)</ref>. In this framework, the indexing weight w ij attached to term t j in document D i combines two information measures as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,145.56,299.08,205.07,11.24">w ij = Inf 1 ij • Inf 2 ij = -log 2 [Prob 1 ij (tf)] • (1 -Prob 2 ij (tf))</formula><p>The first model PB2 is based on the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,145.56,331.82,373.07,28.42">Prob 1 ij = (e -λj • λ tfij ) / tf ij ! with λ j = tc j / n (1) Prob 2 ij = 1-[(tc j +1) / (df j • (tfn ij +1))] with tfn ij = tf ij • log 2 [1 + ((c • mean dl) / l i )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where tc j represents the number of occurrences of term t j in the collection, df j the number of documents in which the term t j appears, and n the number of documents in the corpus. Moreover, c and mean dl (average document length) are constants whose values are given in the Appendix 1.</p><p>The second model GL2 is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,145.56,420.16,373.07,29.48">Prob 1 ij = [1 / (1+λ j )] • [λ j / (1+λ j )] tfn ij (3) Prob 2 ij = tfn ij / (tfn ij + 1)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>For the third model I(n)B2, we still use Equation 2 to compute Prob 2 ij but the implementation of Inf 1 ij is modified as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,145.56,481.60,373.07,11.24">Inf 1 ij = tfn ij • log 2 [(n+1) / (df j +0.5)]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>For the fourth model I(n e )C2 the initial value of Prob 2 ij is obtained from Equation 2 and for the value Inf 1 ij we use:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,145.56,526.36,373.07,11.24">Inf 1 ij = tfn ij • log 2 [(n+1) / (n e +0.5)] with n e = n • [1 -[(n-1) / n] tcj ]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Finally, we also consider an approach based on a statistical language model (LM) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,414.12,546.21,61.28,8.43" target="#b6">(Hiemstra 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,477.72,546.21,20.35,8.43" target="#b7">2002)</ref>, known as a non-parametric probabilistic model (both Okapi and DFR are viewed as parametric models). Thus, the probability estimates would not be based on any known distribution (as in Equations 1, or 3), but rather be estimated directly based on the occurrence frequencies in document D or corpus C. Within this language model (LM) paradigm, various implementations and smoothing methods might be considered, and in this study we adopt a model proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,172.80,599.25,61.55,8.43" target="#b7">Hiemstra (2002)</ref> as described in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="4,330.24,599.25,3.57,8.43">7</ref>, which combines an estimate based on document (P[t j | D i ]) and on corpus (P[t j | C]) (Jelinek-Mercer smoothing method).</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,145.56,625.12,373.07,23.84">P[D i | Q] = P[D i ] . ∏ t j ∈Q [λ j . P[t j | D i ] + (1-λ j ) . P[t j | C]] with P[t j | D i ] = tf ij /l i and P[t j | C] = df j /lc with lc = ∑ k df k (7)</formula><p>where λ j is a smoothing factor (constant for all indexing terms t j , and usually fixed at 0.35) and lc an estimate of the size of the corpus C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Overall Evaluation</head><p>To measure the retrieval performance, we adopted the mean average precision (MAP) (computed on the basis of 1,000 retrieved items per request by the new TREC-EVAL program). In the following tables, the best performances under the given conditions (with the same indexing scheme and the same collection) are listed in bold type.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,130.08,122.25,4.67,8.43" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the MAP obtained by the seven probabilistic models and the classical tf idf vector-space model using the German or English collection and three different query formulations (title-only or T, TD, and TDN). In the bottom lines we reported the MAP average over the best 6 IR models (the average is computed without the tf idf scheme), and the percent change over the medium (TD) query formulation. The DFR I(n)B2 model for the German and also for the English corpus tend to produce the best retrieval performances.   <ref type="formula" coords="5,92.88,356.85,15.73,8.43">2004</ref>)). The last three lines in this table indicate the MAP average computed for the 4 IR models, the percent change compared to the medium (TD) query formulation, and the percent change when comparing word-based and 4-gram indexing approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mean average precision</head><p>From this table, we can see that when using word-based indexing, the DFR I(n e )B2 or the LM models tend to perform the best. With the 4-gram indexing approach, the LM model always presents the best performing schemes. The short query formulation (T) tends to produce a better retrieval performance than medium (TD) topic formulation. As shown in the last line, when comparing the word-based and 4-gram indexing systems, the relative difference is seen to be rather short (around 4.6%) and favors the 4-gram approach.</p><p>Using our evaluation approach, evaluation differences occur when comparing with values computed according to the official measure (the latter always takes 25 queries into account).  Rocchio's query expansion approach however does not always significantly improve the MAP. Such a query expansion approach is based on term co-occurrence data and tends to include additional terms that occur very frequently in the documents. In such cases, these additional search terms will not always be effective in discriminating between relevant and non-relevant documents, and the final effect on retrieval performance could be negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mean average precision</head><p>As another pseudo-relevance feedback technique we may apply an idf-based approach (denoted "idf" in following tables) <ref type="bibr" coords="7,158.76,137.85,88.87,8.43" target="#b0">(Abdou &amp; Savoy, 2008)</ref>. In this query expansion scheme, the inclusion of new search terms is based on their idf values, tending to enlarge the query with more infrequent terms. Overall this idf-based term selection performs rather well and usually its retrieval performance is more robust.</p><p>For example, with the Russian language (Table <ref type="table" coords="7,284.28,175.29,3.51,8.43">6</ref>, third and fifth column), this idf-based blind query expansion may also improve the MAP (e.g., +19.5% with the Okapi model, 0.1612) but, on the other hand, with the DFR I(n e )B2 model, the MAP is slightly reduced (-2.3% from 0.1468 to 0.1433).</p><p>However, the idf-based query expansion tends to include rare terms, without considering the context. Thus among the top-k retrieved documents such a scheme may add terms appearing far away from where the search terms occurred. The single selection criterion is based only on idf values, not the position of those additional terms in the top-ranked documents. This year we investigated retrieval effectiveness when including a second criterion in the selection of terms to be included in the new expanded query. We considered it to be important to expand the query using terms appearing close to a search term (fixed at 10 indexing terms in the current experiments). This short window includes 10 terms to the right and 10 terms to the left of each query term. This type of query expansion method is denoted as "idf-window" in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,261.00,287.01,3.57,8.43" target="#tab_5">7</ref>.</p><p>Finally, to find words or expressions related to the current request, we considered using commercial search engines (e.g., Google) or online encyclopedia (e.g., Wikipedia). In this case, we submitted a query containing the short topic formulation (T or title-only) to each information service. When using Google, we fetched the first two text snippets and added them as additional terms to the original topic formulation, forming a new expanded query. When using Wikipedia, we fetched the first returned article and added the ten most frequent terms (tf) contained in the extracted article. The retrieval effectiveness of our two new query expansion approaches is depicted in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,451.68,476.49,4.67,8.43" target="#tab_5">7</ref> (German collection) and is compared to two other query expansion techniques. Compared to the performance before query expansion (0.4096), Rocchio's and the idf-based blind query expansion cannot improve the MAP. On the other hand, the variant "idf-window" presents a better retrieval performance (+4.9%, from 0.4069 to 0.4247). Using the first two text snippets returned by Google, we may also enhance slightly the MAP (from 0.4096 to 0.4196, or +2.4%). The MAP variation varied according to approaches and parameter settings, while the largest enhancement could be found using the idf+window technique (forth column in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,361.68,540.09,3.38,8.43" target="#tab_5">7</ref>). Finally, using Google to find related terms or phrases implied that we required more processing time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Official Results</head><p>Table 8 describes our 9 official runs in the monolingual GIRT task. In this case each run was built using a data fusion operator "Z-Score" (see <ref type="bibr" coords="7,208.32,613.05,86.75,8.43" target="#b14">(Savoy &amp; Berger, 2005)</ref>). For all runs, we automatically expanded the queries using the blind relevance feedback method of Rocchio (denoted "Roc"), our IDFQE approach (denoted "idf"), or our new window-based approach (denoted "idf-win"). Finally Table <ref type="table" coords="7,318.00,634.17,4.67,8.43" target="#tab_7">8</ref> depicts the MAP obtained for the Russian collection when considering 24 queries and in parenthesis, the official MAP computed for 25 queries.</p><p>As a complementary search technique, we used two stemmers when defining the official run UniNEDSde3. In this case we first applied our light stemming approach and then a more aggressive one. If the same term was produced by the two stemmers, we only kept one occurrence. On the other hand, if the returned stem differed, we added the two forms to the query formulation.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>For our participation in this domain-specific evaluation campaign, we evaluated different probabilistic models using the German, English and Russian languages. For the German and Russian languages we applied our light stemming approach and stopword list. The resulting MAP (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="8,359.88,467.97,4.67,8.43" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="8,382.80,467.97,3.96,8.43" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) show that the DFR I(n)B2 or the LM model usually provided in the best retrieval effectiveness. The performance differences between Okapi and the various DFR models were usually rather small.</p><p>In our analysis of the blind query expansion approaches (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="8,361.56,505.41,20.22,8.43">4 to 6</ref>), we find that this type of automatic query expansion we used can sometimes enhance the MAP. Depending on the collection or languages however, this approach will not provide the same degree of improvement or can sometimes hurt the retrieval effectiveness. For example this search strategy results in less improvement for the English corpus than it does for the Russian collection. For the German collection however, this search strategy clearly hurt the MAP. This year we suggest two new query expansion techniques. The first, denoted "idf-window", is based on co-occurrence of relatively rare terms in a close context (within 10 terms from the occurrence of a search term in a retrieved document). As a second approach, we add the first two text snippets found by Google to expand the query. Compared to the performance before query expansion (e.g., with Okapi the MAP is 0.4096), Rocchio's and the idf-based blind query expansion cannot improve this retrieval performance. On the other hand, the variant "idf-window" presents a better retrieval performance (+4.9%, from 0.4069 to 0.4247). Using the first two text snippets returned by Google, we may also enhance slightly the MAP (from 0.4096 to 0.4196, or +2.4%).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,216.24,382.05,179.15,8.43;2,99.48,402.33,28.43,8.43;2,99.48,413.61,120.71,8.43;2,99.48,424.89,391.67,8.43;2,99.48,436.17,109.14,8.43;2,99.48,447.45,108.56,8.43;2,99.48,458.73,116.39,8.43;2,99.48,470.01,100.23,8.43;2,99.48,481.29,172.15,8.43;2,99.48,492.57,197.72,8.43;2,99.48,503.85,193.52,8.43;2,99.48,515.13,196.35,8.43;2,99.48,526.41,127.16,8.43;2,99.48,537.69,161.31,8.43;2,99.48,548.97,176.51,8.43;2,99.48,560.25,42.46,8.43"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of record written in German &lt;DOC&gt; &lt;DOCNO&gt; GIRT-EN19901932 &lt;TITLE-EN&gt; The Socio-Economic Transformation of a Region : the Bergische Land from 1930 to 1960 &lt;AUTHOR&gt; Henne, Franz J. &lt;AUTHOR&gt; Geyer, Michael &lt;PUBLICATION-YEAR&gt; 1990 &lt;LANGUAGE-CODE&gt; EN &lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-EN&gt; Rhenish Prussia &lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-EN&gt; historical development &lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-EN&gt; regional development &lt;CONTROLLED-TERM-EN&gt; socioeconomic factors &lt;METHOD-TERM-EN&gt; historical &lt;METHOD-TERM-EN&gt; document analysis &lt;CLASSIFICATION-TEXT-EN&gt; Social History &lt;DOC&gt; …</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Blind-Query Expansion</head><p>To provide a better match between user information needs and documents, various query expansion techniques have been suggested. The general principle is to expand the query using words or phrases having similar meanings to, or related to those appearing in the original request. To achieve this, query expansion approaches consider various relationships between these words, along with term selection mechanisms and term weighting schemes. Specific answers regarding the best technique may vary, thus leading to a variety of query expansion approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="6,92.88,162.69,71.69,8.43" target="#b3">(Efthimiadis, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>In our first attempt to find related search terms, we might ask the user to select additional terms to be included in an expanded query. This could be handled interactively through displaying a ranked list of retrieved items returned by the first query. As a second strategy, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,245.64,200.13,58.91,8.43" target="#b12">Rocchio (1971)</ref> proposed taking the relevance or non-relevance of top-ranked documents into account, as indicated manually by the user. In this case, a new query would then be built automatically in the form of a linear combination of the term included in the previous query and terms automatically extracted from both relevant (with a positive weight) and non-relevant documents (with a negative weight). Empirical studies have demonstrated that such an approach is usually quite effective.</p><p>As a third technique, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,186.48,258.81,79.79,8.43" target="#b2">Buckley et al. (1996)</ref> suggested that even without looking at them or asking the user, it could be assumed that the top-k ranked documents would be relevant. This method, denoted as the pseudo-relevance feedback or blind-query expansion approach does not require user intervention. Moreover, using the MAP as performance measure is a strategy that usually tends to enhance performance measures.</p><p>In the current context, we used Rocchio's formulation (denoted "Rocchio") with α = 0.75, β = 0.75, whereby the system was allowed to add m terms extracted from the k best ranked documents from the original query. For the German corpus (Table <ref type="table" coords="6,179.64,329.25,3.57,8.43">4</ref>, third column), such a search technique does not seem to enhance the MAP. For the English collection (Table <ref type="table" coords="6,190.08,339.81,3.51,8.43">5</ref>, second and third column), Rocchio's blind query expansion may improve the MAP from +9.3% (DFR PB2, 0.3101 vs. 0.3392) or hurt the retrieval performance -8.72% (Okapi model, 0.3039 vs. 0.2774). For the Russian language (Table <ref type="table" coords="6,252.60,361.05,3.51,8.43">6</ref>, second and forth column), blind query expansion improves the MAP (e.g., +28.98% with the Okapi model, 0.1740 vs. 0.1349 or +2.3% with the DFR I(n e )B2 model, 0.1503 vs. 0.1468). </p></div>
