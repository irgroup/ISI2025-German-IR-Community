<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the third participation of the SINAI research group from University of Jaén in GeoCLEF track. We have tried to improve the system proposed last year in GeoCLEF 2007. The main developments are related to the use of query reformulation, keywords recognition, hyponyms extraction and query geo-expansion. On the other hand, new rules have been applied in the Validator subsystem in order to filter the documents recovered by the IR subsystem. We have run several experiments, combining these developments in order to resolve the monolingual and bilingual tasks. The results obtained shown that filtering does not reach yet to improve the baseline case. However, the use of keywords and hyponyms in the re-ranking process seems to improve the filtering results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>GeoCLEF is a cross-language Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) task at the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) campaign since 2005. The aim of GeoCLEF is to evaluate GIR systems. Given a multilingual statement describing a spatial user need (topic), the challenge is to find relevant documents from target collections using queries into several languages <ref type="bibr" coords="1,435.19,670.89,10.52,10.46" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,448.88,670.89,7.01,10.46" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Queries are textual descriptions with three fields (title, description and narrative), including spatial relations and geographic locations such us continents, seas, rivers or regions.</p><p>This paper describes the approaches taken by the SINAI<ref type="foot" coords="1,346.27,705.68,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_0">1</ref> research group from the University of Jaén for the main GeoCLEF 2008 subtasks: mono and bilingual retrieval. In 2006 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,450.30,718.71,9.96,10.46" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we studied the behavior of query expansion using a gazetteer and a thesaurus. In GeoCLEF 2007 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,483.94,110.53,9.96,10.46" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we changed the approach and we applied filtering to the documents retrieved by the IR subsystem. This year, our GIR system, called SINAI-GIR, follows a similar architecture of the previous one presented at GeoCLEF 2007 but using new developments related to several techniques such as query reformulation, keywords and hyponyms extraction and even query geo-expansion. We have also implemented new rules for the filtering and re-ranking of documents retrieved.</p><p>Next section describes the whole system. Then, in the section 3, each module of the system is explained. Following, results are described and finally, the conclusions about our participation in GeoCLEF 2008 are expounded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Overview</head><p>Our SINAI-GIR system is made up of five main subsystems: Translator, Collection Preprocessing subsystem, Query Analyzer, Information Retrieval subsystem and Validator. We make use of the Geonames gazetteer<ref type="foot" coords="2,176.12,283.77,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_1">2</ref> as geographic knowledge base for the whole system. As Information Retrieval (IR) index-search engine we have used Lemur <ref type="foot" coords="2,288.59,295.73,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>Each translated query is preprocessed and analyzed by the Query Analyzer, identifying their geo-entities and spatial relations. This module also applies query reformulation based on the query parsing subtask <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.66,332.67,9.96,10.46" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, generating several independent queries which will be indexed and searched by means of the IR subsystem. On the other hand, the collection is preprocessed by the Collection Preprocessing module and finally the documents recovered by the IR subsystem are filtered and reranked by means of the Validator subsystem. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,320.33,368.53,4.98,10.46" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the SINAI-GIR system architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Subsystems Description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Translator</head><p>As translation module, we have used SINTRAM (SINai TRAnslation Module), our Machine Translation system which works with different online machine translators and implements several heuristics to combine different translations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,251.68,467.57,9.96,10.46" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This module translates the queries from other languages into English.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Collection Preprocessing Subsystem</head><p>In our architecture we only worked with English documents collection <ref type="foot" coords="2,403.60,524.73,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_3">4</ref> and we have applied a off-line preprocess to this one. In this preprocess we have applied the Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,481.48,537.75,9.96,10.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the English stop-words list, the Brill POS tagger <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.90,549.71,10.52,10.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and a specific Named Entity Recognizer (NER). The collection preprocessed is indexed later using the IR subsystem.</p><p>During the preprocessing, two indexes are generated:</p><p>• The locations index. This index stores all location entities detected and recognized by the NER in each document of the collection. This year we have used LingPipe<ref type="foot" coords="2,469.78,604.37,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_4">5</ref> as NER in our architecture. All entities classified as a location by the NER are checked using the GeoNames gazetteer. This locations index will be used later by the Validator in order to filter the documents recovered by the IR subsystem. We have considered as keyword the nouns that appearing more than once in the document.</p><p>We have decided to consider only the nouns because they have more meaning than verbs or adjectives. This keywords will be used by the Validator in order to re-rank the documents recovered by the IR subsystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Query Analyzer</head><p>The Query Analyzer module is responsible for preprocessing of English queries as well as the generation of different query reformulations. This analyzer is also made up of several components:</p><p>Preprocessing module. This module removes guidance information from the topics such us "Relevant documents contain information about", "Find documents describing" or "To be relevant, documents must describe", and descriptions about irrelevant documents. The default query (Q 1 ) is formed by the preprocessed content of the title, description and narrative labels of the topics, applying the Porter stemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,331.78,602.23,10.52,10.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and discarding the English stop-words.</p><p>NER module. The aim of this NER module is to recognize the locations in the queries. As in the Collection Preprocessing subsystem, we have used LingPipe. All locations detected are also verified using the GeoNames gazetteer.</p><p>Geo-Relation Finder module. This module is used to find the spatial relations in the queries.</p><p>It is based on manual rules and the entities detected by the NER module. This module makes use of several text files that store all geo-relations that can be detect. Some examples of these spatial relations are: in, near, north of, next to, in or around, in the west of... Query Reformulation module. This module parses only the title of the query, detecting the three components on which it is usually composed: "what", "geo-relation" and "where". Before the query parsing, we apply a particular translation of sentences like "capital of &lt;entity&gt;" or "&lt;entity&gt;'s capital ", replacing the entire sentence by the corrected location using the Geonames gazetteer. By example, the sentence "the capital of France" would be replaced by "Paris". This module generates three query reformulations:</p><p>• Q 1 : it is formed by the preprocessed content of the topic labels, depending on the experiment. Some experiments consider only the content of the title and description from the topics. Others consider the content of all labels (title, description and narrative).</p><p>• Q 2 : it is formed only by the concatenation of "what" and "where" components detected in the title of the topic.</p><p>• Q 3 : it is the same as the previous one, but adding it the expanded locations found in Geonames gazetteer, related to the "where" component and depending on the georelation detected in the title of the topic.</p><p>Keywords-Hyponyms extractor module. The aim of this module is to detect the keywords only in the title of the queries. As in the Collection Preprocessing subsystem, we have considered as keywords only the nouns because they have more importance than verbs or adjectives in the re-ranking process. We have used the Brill POS tagger <ref type="bibr" coords="4,441.35,301.82,10.52,10.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to detect the nouns. In addition, for each keyword recognized, this module extracts its hyponyms using WordNet<ref type="foot" coords="4,154.51,324.66,3.97,7.32" target="#foot_5">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,158.97,325.73,9.96,10.46" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. These extracted hyponyms also will be used later in the re-ranking process by the Validator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Information Retrieval Subsystem</head><p>The index-search engine that we have used in the experiments is Lemur. It is a open toolkit that supports indexing of large-scale text databases, the construction of simple language models for documents, queries, or sub-collections, and the implementation of retrieval systems based on language models. Lemur supports several weighting functions such as Okapi <ref type="bibr" coords="4,434.83,419.83,14.61,10.46" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, TF•IDF and the use of Pseudo-Relevant Feedback (PRF) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,283.99,431.78,14.61,10.46" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In the experiments carried out in this paper we have always used the Okapi with PRF because it is the weighting function which offers the best results.</p><p>The aim of this module is to retrieve the most relevant documents for each query reformulation. As we can see in the previous section, the Query Analyzer generates three queries for each topic (Q 1 , Q 2 and Q 3 ). The list of retrieved documents for the Q 1 query is considered as baseline case in our experiments because we do not apply it any filtering or re-ranking process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Validator</head><p>The aim of the Validator process is to filter the lists of documents recovered by the IR subsystem, establishing what of them are valid, depending on the locations and the geo-relations detected in the query. Another important function of this process is to establish the final ranking of documents, based on manual rules and predefined weights. These predefined weights allow to assign a score to each document, in addition to the score provided by the IR subsystem.</p><p>In order to validate each document recovered, the Validator applies different manual rules, making use of geographical data detected in the topic. Some examples of these manual rules are:</p><p>• If the entity of the topic is a country and its geo-relation associated is "in the north of ", the Validator will accept the document if it has any location situated in the north of that country. Using the Geonames gazetteer, the module obtains the maximum and minimum latitudes of all locations that belong to that country. Then, it calculates half of the latitude from the maximal and minimal latitudes to estimate the north of the region.</p><p>• If the entity of the topic is a city and its geo-relation associated is "near to", the module will consider that a location is near to another one when it is at a distance of less than 50 kilometers around. We have tried several distances in the experiments and the distance of 50 kilometers provided us the best results. In order to measure the distance in kilometers between two locations we have used the simple formula for calculating the distance with geographic coordinates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,279.84,158.02,68.23,10.80">d = (x 2 + y 2 )</formula><p>where:</p><p>x = 110.56 * abs(lat2 -lat1) y = 84.8 * abs(lon2 -lon1) lat2, lat1, lon2 and lon1 are the latitudes and longitudes from location 2 and 1 respectively. If the d value is less than 50, the location 1 will be considered near to location 2.</p><p>• If the entity of the topic is a continent or a country and its geo-relation associated is "in", "of ", "at", "on", "from" or "along", the module will accept the document recovered if a location exists in the document that belongs to that continent or country.</p><p>In order to re-rank each valid document recovered, the Validator makes use of several predefined weights that are added to the score provided by the IR subsystem, depending on the manual rules which the document complies. By example, there is a predefined weight for the first manual rule previously explained (the entity type is country and its geo-relation associated is "in the north of "). If any document complies with that rule, the predefined weight for that rule is added to the IR score of the document. In the experiments carried out in this paper we have tried with several weights, allowing us for an optimal adjustment of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and Results</head><p>SINAI has participated in monolingual and bilingual tasks with a total of 15 experiments. In some experiments we have considered the content of all the topics labels (title, description and narrative), identified them as TDN, and for others experiments we have considered only the title and description labels, identified them as TD.</p><p>Our baseline experiment consists of the retrieval of documents more relevant by means of IR subsystem using the Q 1 as query for each topic, without applying any filtering or re-ranking process. This baseline experiment has been applied in the monolingual and bilingual tasks, using TDN and TD labels from topics.</p><p>Other experiments carried out in this paper consist of applying the filtering and re-ranking processes to the different lists of relevant documents retrieved by the IR subsystem. In some experiments, the filtering and re-ranking processes have been applied to the fusion list of the documents recovered by the Q 1 , Q 2 and Q 3 queries for each topic. This fusion list is generated by adding the documents from Q 2 and Q 3 lists that are not in Q 1 . In other experiments, we have considered the use of keywords and hyponyms in the re-ranking process.</p><p>With respect to the weighting function used in the IR subsystem, in the experiments carried out in this paper we have always used Okapi with PRF because after trying several weighting functions, it offers the best results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Monolingual task</head><p>In monolingual task we have participated with a total of 9 experiments. Three of them are considered as baseline experiments because we have not applied any filtering or re-ranking process to the list of recovered documents. Other experiments combining the fusion list and the use of keywords and hyponyms. The results for monolingual task are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,432.65,701.74,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Bilingual task</head><p>In bilingual task we have participated with a total of 6 experiments. We have used the English collection and the topics in Portuguese and German languages. Three of the experiments are considered as the baseline case because we have not applied any filtering or re-ranking process to them. Other experiments combining the filtering and re-ranking process without the use of keywords or hyponyms. The results for bilingual task are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,409.98,465.84,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>The analysis of results based on MAP values shows that the filtering and re-ranking process does not improve the baseline case, because the re-ranking process is not performing well yet. There are valid documents which do not rise enough in the final ranking. Moreover, the number of documents recovered by the IR subsystem normally is around 3000 and the size of the final list returned by the Validator is 1000, so some valid documents are left outside for some topics. However, in some experiments in which we apply filtering, the use of keywords improves the result obtained without using keywords. Instead, the use of hyponyms does not improve in any case the results.</p><p>On the other hand, surprisingly we have obtained best results using only the content of the title and description labels from the topics (TD), unlike what happened in the 2007 experiments, where we reached the best results using the content of all labels (TDN ).</p><p>In reference to the results obtained for the bilingual task, we can affirm that the Translator module works better with Portuguese. As in the monolingual experiments, the best results have been achieved without the use of filtering or re-ranking process, although the results using filtering almost equal the baseline experiments.</p><p>In this paper we have presented the experiments carried out in our third participation in the GeoCLEF track, following the basic architecture used in the 2007 experiments. We have tried to improve the filtering and re-ranking process introduced the previous year, adding new developments related to several techniques such as query reformulation, keywords and hyponyms extraction and even query geo-expansion. Moreover, we have established predefined weights for each manual rule in Validator in order to improve the final score of the valid documents. However, we still get the best result without applying any of these techniques. This is because we have not used an optimal method to raise valid documents in the final ranking, depending on the geo-information that recovered documents and topics have in common.</p><p>About the new developments employed in the experiments, only the use of keywords in the reranking process seems to improve the filtering results in some cases. Instead, the use of hyponyms does not improve the results. Therefore, the proper use of keywords for the re-ranking process could be interesting in the future.</p><p>With respect to the experiments in which we have used the fusion list, the results obtained indicates that the query reformulation does not seem to work well in this field, although in some topics the Q 2 and Q 3 query types add valid documents to the final list which have not been found by the IR subsystem using the default query (Q 1 ).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,210.74,398.87,181.53,10.46"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SINAI-GIR system architecture</figDesc></figure>
