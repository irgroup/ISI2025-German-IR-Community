<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This year our system was complemented with a map-based filter. During the indexing phase, all places are disambiguated and assigned their coordinates on the map. These coordinates are stored in a separate index. The search process is carried out in two phases: in the first one, we search the collection with the same method applied in 2007, which exploits the expansion of index terms by means of WordNet synonyms and holonyms. The next phase consists in a re-ranking of the results of the previous phase depending on the distance of document toponyms from the toponyms in the query, or depending on the fact that the document contains toponyms that are included in an area defined by the query. The area is calculated from the toponyms in the query and their meronyms. This is the first attempt to use GeoWordNet, a resource that includes the geographical coordinates of the places listed in WordNet, for the Geographical Information Retrieval task. The results show that map-based filtering allows to improve the results obtained by the base system, based only on the textual information.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Our group has been participating in the GeoCLEF task since 2005, focusing on the use of WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,697.82,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref> ontology for the Geographical Information Retrieval Task (GIR). The method that produced the best results was introduced in 2006 and refined in 2007. It uses exclusively textual information <ref type="bibr" coords="1,90.00,721.70,21.60,8.77">[3, ?]</ref>, exploiting the part-of (or holonymy) relationship provided by WordNet. It consists in an expansion of geographical locations with their holonyms, that is, the containing entities. These are stored in an index together with their synonyms. This method would allow a user searching for information about Spain to find also documents containing Valencia, Madrid or Barcelona, although the original document does not contain the word "Spain".</p><p>For our 2008 participation, we attempted to improve the method by introducing map-based filtering. The most succesful methods in 2006 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.79,147.89,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and 2007 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.13,147.89,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> both combined textual retrieval with geographical-based filtering and ranking. This observation prompted us to introduce a similar feature in our system. The main obstacle was determined by the fact that we use WordNet, which did not provide us with geographical coordinates for toponyms. Therefore, we first had to develop GeoWordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.12,195.71,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, a georeferenced version of WordNet. By combining this resource with the WordNet-based toponym disambiguation algorithm in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.18,207.66,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we are able to assign to the place names in the collection their actual geographical coordinates and to perform some geographical reasoning. We called the resulting system GeoWorSE (an acronym for Geographical Wordnet Search Engine).</p><p>In the following section, we describe the GeoWorSE system. In section 3 we describe the characteristics of our submissions and the obtained results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The GeoWorSE System</head><p>The core of the system is constituted by the Lucene 1 open source search engine, version 2.1. Named Entity Recognition and classification is carried out by the Stanford NER system based on Conditional Random Fields <ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.25,346.11,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The access to WordNet is done by the MIT Java WordNet Interface 2 . The toponym disambiguator is based on the method presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.57,358.07,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Indexing</head><p>During the indexing phase, the documents are examined in order to find location names (toponym) by means of the Stanford NER system. When a toponym is found, the disambiguator determines the correct reference for the toponym. Then, a modified lucene indexer adds to the geo index the toponym coordinates (retrieved from GeoWordNet); finally, it stores in the wn index the toponym together with its holonyms and synonyms. All document terms are stored in the text index. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,121.44,464.12,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we show the architecture of the indexing module. The indices are then used in the search phase, although the geo index is not used for search: it is used only to retrieve the coordinates of the toponyms in the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Searching</head><p>The architecture of the search module is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,342.81,170.18,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The topic text is searched by Lucene in the text index. All the toponyms are extracted by the Stanford NER and searched for by Lucene in the wn index with a weight 0.25 with respect to the content terms. The result of the search is a list of documents ranked using the Lucene's weighting scheme (basically, this is the output that the system presented in 2007 would have returned). At the same time, the toponyms are passed to the GeoAnalyzer, which creates a geographical constraint that is used to re-rank the document list. The GeoAnalyzer may return two types of geographical constraints:</p><p>• a distance constraint, corresponding to a point in the map: the documents that contain locations closer to this point will be ranked higher;</p><p>• an area constraint, correspoinding to a polygon in the map: the documents that contain locations included in the polygon will be ranked higher;</p><p>For instance, in topic 10.2452/58 -GC there is a distance constraint: "Travel problems at major airports near to London". Topic 10.2452/76 -GC contains an area constraint: "Riots in South American prisons". The GeoAnalyzer determines the area using WordNet meronyms: South America is expanded to its meronyms: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela. The area is obtained by calculating the convex hull of the points associated to the meronyms using the Graham algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.03,697.82,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The topic narrative allows to increase the precision of the considered area, since the toponyms in the narrative are also expanded to their meronyms (when possible). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,430.27,721.73,4.98,8.74">3</ref> shows the convex hulls of the points corresponding to the meronyms of "South America", using only topic and description (left) or all the fields, including narrative (right).  <ref type="figure" coords="4,121.57,268.89,3.87,8.74">3</ref>: Areas corresponding to "South America" for topic 10.2452/76 -GC, calculated as the convex hull (in red) of the points (connected by blue lines) extracted by means of the WordNet meronymy relationship. On the left, the result using only topic and description; on the right, also the narrative has been included. Black dots represents the locations contained in GeoWordNet.</p><p>The objective of the GeoFilter module is to re-rank the documents retrieved by Lucene, according to geographical information. If the constraint extracted from the topic is a distance constraint, the weights of the documents are modified according to the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,196.09,392.87,316.91,14.58">w(doc) = w Lucene (doc) * (1 + exp(-min p∈P d(q, p)))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where w Lucene is the weight returned by Lucene for the document doc, P is the set of points in the document, and q is the point extracted from the topic.</p><p>If the constraint extracted from the topic is an area constraint, the weights of the documents are modified according to formula 2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,222.18,470.94,290.82,22.31">w(doc) = w Lucene (doc) * 1 + |P q | |P |<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P q is the set of points in the document that are contained in the area extracted from the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>We submitted a total of 6 runs at GeoCLEF 2008. Two runs were used as "benchmarks": they were obtained by using the base Lucene system, without index term expansion, in one case considering only topic title and description, and all fields in the other case. One run was generated with the system we presented in 2007 (without the re-ranking by the geofilter module). For the three remaining submissions we used the new system with topic and description only, topic, description and narrative, and a configuration that do not use wordnet information during the search phase.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,145.03,638.05,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we show the results obtained in terms of Mean Average Precision and R-Precision for all the submitted runs.</p><p>The obtained results show that the runs that used only the information contained in the Title and Description fields were considerably better than runs that included also the narrative, inverting the trend of the past GeoCLEF exercises, where TDN runs usually were better than TD ones. We analyzed the results topic by topic and compared the performance of runs that used TD only and runs that used also narrative. The topics that present the greatest difference between the two types of runs are 10.2452/GC -76, 10.2452/GC -77 and 10.2452/GC -91, in which the use of narrative makes the results worse. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,303.62,733.69,4.98,8.74">4</ref> shows in detail the average difference between the two types of runs.  <ref type="figure" coords="5,122.02,465.90,3.87,8.74">4</ref>: Average difference (in percentage) for the mean average precision obtained with runs that used only title and description (TD) and runs that used also narrative (TDN).</p><p>The analysis of the narratives of these three runs shows that they include a long list of place names. These lists alter the balance between content keywords and geographical terms of the query, with the effect of giving more importance in the query to the geographical constraint than over the words related to the information searched for.</p><p>The comparison of the new method with the baseline obtained without the map constraint shows that map filtering allowed to improve the results over the method previously used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Further Work</head><p>We introduced a map-based filtering method that allowed us to improve the results obtained with our WordNet-based method. The best results were obtained with the map-based method, taking into account only topic title and description. We believe that topic narrative could be used more efficiently to improve the map-based filtering rather than using it directly during the search phase. We plan to carry out some experiments with this configuration in order to verify our hypothesis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,208.63,700.62,185.75,8.74;2,132.30,484.82,338.41,200.69"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Diagram of the Indexing module</figDesc><graphic coords="2,132.30,484.82,338.41,200.69" type="bitmap" /></figure>
