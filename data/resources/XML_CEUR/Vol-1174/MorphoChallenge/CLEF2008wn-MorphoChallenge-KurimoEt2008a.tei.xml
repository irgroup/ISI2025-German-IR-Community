<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of Morpho Challenge 2008 was to find and evaluate unsupervised algorithms that provide morpheme analyses for words in different languages. Especially in morphologically complex languages, such as Finnish, Turkish and Arabic, morpheme analysis is important for lexical modeling of words in speech recognition, information retrieval and machine translation. The evaluation in Morpho Challenge competitions consisted of both a linguistic and an application oriented performance analysis. This paper describes an evaluation where the competition entries were compared to a linguistic morpheme analysis gold standard. Because the morpheme labels in an unsupervised analysis can be arbitrary, the evaluation is based on matching the morpheme-sharing words between the proposed and the gold standard analyses. In addition to Finnish, Turkish, German and English evaluations performed in Morpho Challenge 2007, the competition this year had an additional evaluation in Arabic. The results in 2008 show that although the level of precision and recall varies substantially between the tasks in different languages, the best methods seem to manage all the tested languages quite well. The Morpho Challenge was part of the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL Challenge Program and organized in collaboration with CLEF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The topic of the Morpho Challenge 2008 competition is to evaluate proposed unsupervised machine learning algorithms in the task of morpheme analysis for words in different languages. The Morpho Challenge evaluation consisted of both a linguistic and an application oriented performance analysis. The linguistic evaluation described in this paper, Competition 1, is based on a comparison of the suggested morpheme analysis to a linguistic morpheme analysis gold standard. The practical application oriented evaluation described in the companion paper <ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.68,123.98,14.62,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Competition 2, contained information retrieval (IR) experiments from CLEF, where the all the words in the queries and text corpus were replaced by their morpheme analyses.</p><p>The Morpho Challenge 2008 tasks and training corpora were the same as in our previous Morpho Challenge 2007 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.16,171.80,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, except that it involved one additional morphologically complex language, Arabic. There was also an optional evaluation of the IR performance using the morpheme analysis of word forms in their full text context. The difference to our first Morpho Challenge 2005 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,502.48,195.71,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> which focused on just the segmentation of words into morphologically meaningful units, was that the units should further be clustered into the abstract classes of morphemes. For example, this analysis should find the link between the word forms "foot" and "feet".</p><p>Especially in morphologically complex languages, such as Finnish, Turkish and Arabic, the morpheme analysis is important for lexical modeling of words in speech recognition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.00,255.48,10.51,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.17,255.48,7.01,8.74" target="#b8">9]</ref>, information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.53,267.44,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.70,267.44,7.75,8.74" target="#b6">7]</ref> and machine translation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.02,267.44,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.18,267.44,11.63,8.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Due to the high level of agglutination, inflection, and compounding, there are millions of different word forms, which is clearly too much for building an effective vocabulary and training probabilistic models for the relations between words. There also exist carefully constructed linguistic tools for morphological analysis, but only for few languages. Even in these cases using statistical machine learning methods we may still discover interesting alternatives that may rival even the most sophisticated linguistically designed morphologies.</p><p>The scientific objectives of the Morpho Challenge competitions are: to learn about the word construction in natural languages, to advance machine learning methodology, and to discover approaches that are suitable for many languages. The portability to different languages is very important, because the language technology often needs to be quickly extended to various new languages for which there are limited amount of resources available. Unsupervised learning is then the most attractive approach for data analysis, because the majority of the available data is unannotated and human annotation work is expensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task and Data in Competition 1</head><p>The task in the Morpho Challenge 2008 was to return the given list of words in each language extended by the morpheme analysis of each word form. The morpheme analyses should be obtained by an unsupervised learning algorithm that would preferably be as language independent as possible. In each language, the participants were pointed to a training corpus in which all the words occur (in a sentence), so that the algorithms may also utilize information about the word context. The tasks were the same as in the Morpho Challenge 2007 last year with the addition of one new language, Arabic.</p><p>The training corpora were the same as in the Morpho Challenge 2007, except for Arabic: 3 million sentences for English, Finnish and German, and 1 million sentences for Turkish in plain unannotated text files that were all downloadable from the Wortschatz collection<ref type="foot" coords="2,443.50,583.64,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> at the University of Leipzig (Germany). The corpora were specially preprocessed for the Morpho Challenge (tokenized, lower-cased, some conversion of character encodings).</p><p>The Arabic text data (135K sentences with 3.9M words) is the same as used by Habash and Sadat <ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.66,633.04,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Because this text data is unfortunately not freely available, only a list of word forms was provided, so if the participants wanted to use typical word contexts in training their models in Arabic, they had to find their own text corpus. All words in the Arabic data were presented in Buckwalter transliteration <ref type="foot" coords="2,217.62,667.33,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . In other languages the lists of word forms to be analyzed were extracted from the Wortschatz corpora and included all the different word forms existing there and their frequencies in the corpora. The total amount of word types were 2,206,719 (Finnish), 617,298 (Turkish), 1,266,159 (German), 384,903 (English), and 143,966 (Arabic).</p><p>The exact syntax of the word lists and the required output lists with the suggested morpheme analyses were explained previously in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.30,123.98,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As the learning is unsupervised, the returned morpheme labels may be arbitrary: e.g., "foot", "morpheme42" or "+PL". The order in which the morpheme labels appear after the word forms does not matter. Several interpretations for the same word can also be supplied, and it was left to the participants to decide whether they would be useful in the task, or not.</p><p>3 Reference analysis</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic Gold Standard</head><p>In Competition 1 the proposed unsupervised morpheme analyses were compared to the correct grammatical morpheme analyses called here the linguistic gold standard. The gold standard morpheme analyses were prepared in exactly the same format as the result file the participants were asked to submit, alternative analyses separated by commas. See Table <ref type="table" coords="3,423.33,282.81,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for examples. The gold standard reference analyses were the same as in the Morpho Challenge 2007 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,499.71,512.33,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, except in Arabic. The Arabic gold standard analyses are based on the representation of lexeme and features used in the Aragen system (a wrapper using publicly available BAMA-1 databases) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,90.00,548.19,9.97,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The first part of an analysis is a lexeme followed by a list of features. The original features were here modified to connect the POS label to the root of the word, e.g. "Algbn = gabon POS:N Al+ +SG". In addition, the gender morphemes were removed (e.g. the German gold standard doesn't contain these either). This did not affect the ranking of the submissions, but made the evaluation resemble more the other tested languages.</p><p>In the word lists described in the previous section, the gold standard analyses were available for 650,169 (Finnish), 214,818 (Turkish), 125,641 (German), 63,225 (English), and 141,876 (Arabic) word types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Morfessor</head><p>As baseline results for unsupervised morpheme analysis, the organizers provided morpheme analysis by a publicly available unsupervised algorithm called "Morfessor Categories-MAP" developed at Helsinki University of Technology <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.64,702.07,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (or here "Morfessor catmap" or "Morfessor MAP", for short as in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,141.47,714.02,10.29,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Analysis by the original Morfessor <ref type="bibr" coords="3,321.06,714.02,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,335.59,714.02,7.75,8.74" target="#b3">4]</ref> (or here "Morfessor baseline"), which provides only a surface-level segmentation, was also provided for reference. By the submission DL at the end of June, 2008, four research groups had submitted nine different algorithms which were then evaluated by the organizers. After the DL, more submissions were received from another author (Goodman), which were evaluated separately outside the Competition 1. One group (Can) decided not to submit the final wordlists that could be evaluated and one (McNamee) wanted only to participate in Competition 2. Thus, the final amount of evaluated algorithms was nine: six in Competition 1, one outside the competition, and two reference results by Morfessor. The algorithm submissions and their authors are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,435.15,409.59,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Some characteristics of morpheme analyses proposed by the unsupervised algorithms together with the gold standard analyses are briefly presented in Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,374.58,433.50,4.98,8.74">3</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,403.75,433.50,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. The statistics of each submission include the average amount of alternative analyses per word, the average amount of morphemes per analysis, and the total amount of morpheme types. The "Allomorfessor" is an extension to the "Morfessor Baseline" that attempts to discover common baseforms for the different surface forms that are likely to represent the same morpheme. The "ParaMor" is another algorithm for segmenting words into morphemes which, after improvements from the previous Morpho Challenge, was submitted also as a combination with the publicly available "Morfessor CATMAP". The "Zeman 1" is a resubmission from the previous Morpho Challenge which, after attempts to include a new treatment of prefix, was submitted as the "Zeman 3". It is interesting to note that this year all the algorithms resulted in a very large lexicon, usually much larger than the reference methods did.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation of Competition 1 in Morpho Challenge 2008 was similar as in Morpho Challenge 2007 except that there was one new language, Arabic. The full description of the method to compare the submitted unsupervised morpheme analyses were to the linguistic gold standard analyses is in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.38,643.68,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In the current paper we just remind the main points and obtained performance measures.</p><p>Because the morpheme analysis candidates are achieved by unsupervised learning, the morpheme labels can be arbitrary and different from the ones designed by linguists. The basis of the evaluation is, thus, to compare whether any two word forms that contain the same morpheme according to the participants' algorithm also has a morpheme in common according to the gold standard and vice versa. In practice, the evaluation is performed by randomly sampling a large number of morpheme sharing word pairs from the compared analyses. Then the precision is calculated as the proportion of morpheme sharing word pairs in the participant's sample that really has Table <ref type="table" coords="5,118.25,207.29,3.88,8.74">3</ref>: Statistics and example morpheme analyses in Finnish, Turkish and Arabic. #a is the average amount of analyses per word (separated by a comma), #m the average amount of morphemes per analysis (separated by a space), and lexicon the total amount of morpheme types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Finnish</head><p>Example a morpheme in common according to the gold standard. Correspondingly, the recall is calculated as the proportion of morpheme sharing word pairs in the gold standard sample that also exist in the participant's submission. The sample size in different languages varied depending on the size of the word lists and gold standard: 200,000 (Finnish), 50,000 (Turkish), 50,000 (German), 10,000 (English), and 20,000 (Arabic) word pairs. The F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, was selected as the final evaluation measure:</p><p>F-measure = 1/(1/Precision + 1/Recall) .</p><p>6 Results The results of the linguistic evaluation are presented in Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,386.82,701.71,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="7,415.77,701.71,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_4">6</ref>. The tasks in Competition 1 were the same as in Morpho Challenge 2007, so it is possible to directly compare the improvements made over the previous algorithms. However, direct comparisons between the evaluation measures in different languages are not valid, because the corpora and gold standards are different. In all tasks except the English one, improvements were made in 2008 and the best obtained F-measure was now higher. As clearly seen in Tables <ref type="table" coords="8,376.98,470.56,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="8,406.65,470.56,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_4">6</ref>, this is mainly due to the improved version of "Monson paramor+morfessor" that dominated all tasks. The difference is especially clear in the recall statistics where the performance of the "Monson paramor+morfessor" is superior. Behind Monson's algorithms, the "Zeman 1" that is a re-submission from last year, was better than the rest of the algorithms, which all suffered from a very low recall. It is worth noting that the "Kohonen allomorfessor" algorithm achieved clearly the highest precision of all algorithms in all tasks, but due to the low recall, or undersegmentation, it got rather low F-measure values.</p><p>From the Competition 1 in Morpho Challenge 2007 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,336.18,566.20,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, only the winner "best 2007" in each task was chosen in Tables <ref type="table" coords="8,206.74,578.15,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="8,234.98,578.15,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">6</ref> for reference. The "Monson paramor+morfessor" was able to clearly beat the publicly available reference methods "Morfessor baseline" and "Morfessor catmap" in all tasks. It is interesting to note that the "Morfessor baseline", which is the original simpler Morfessor version and only attempts to split words into morphemes without any further analysis, actually beats the more sophisticated "Morfessor catmap", as well as "Monson morfessor" and "Zeman 1", in English and Arabic. Otherwise, the ranking between the different 2008 algorithms remains the same in all tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussions and Conclusions</head><p>The Morpho Challenge 2008 was a successful follow-up to our previous Morpho Challenges 2005 and 2007. Since the main tasks were unchanged, the participants of the previous challenges were able to track improvements of their algorithms. It also gave a possibility for the new participants and those who missed the previous deadlines to try more established benchmark tasks. This year the evaluation was performed also in Arabic, and despite the relatively small wordlist and the disability to distribute a relevant text corpus, this task was again successful in finding significant differences between the submitted algorithms.</p><p>The significance of the differences in F-measure was analyzed for all algorithm pairs in all tasks using the t-test. The analysis was performed by splitting the data into several partitions and comparing the results in each independent partition separately. The results of the tests show that all differences were statistically significant, except "Zeman 1" vs "Morfessor catmap" in the English task.</p><p>As already noted in the previous section, the ranking of the algorithms would have been very different, if only the precision measure was utilized. Some of the methods, especially "Kohonen allomorfessor" undersegmented the word forms heavily, which produced high precision but low recall. However, because it is difficult to estimate the relative weight of precision against recall in different applications, it remains for the application based evaluations in different tasks to show which algorithms are most useful. Many of the grammatical morphemes (such as +PL and +PAST in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,165.65,279.39,4.43,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are very common and may not be very relevant in IR, for example, compared to recognizing the right stem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,144.99,313.58,309.69,171.56"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Examples of gold standard morpheme analyses.</figDesc><table coords="3,144.99,330.95,309.69,154.19"><row><cell cols="2">Language Examples</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>English</cell><cell>baby-sitters</cell><cell>baby N sit V er s +PL</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>indoctrinated</cell><cell>in p doctrine N ate s +PAST</cell></row><row><cell>Finnish</cell><cell>linuxiin</cell><cell>linux N +ILL</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>makaronia</cell><cell>makaroni N +PTV</cell></row><row><cell>German</cell><cell>choreographische</cell><cell>choreographie N isch +ADJ-e</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">zurueckzubehalten zurueck B zu be halt V +INF</cell></row><row><cell>Turkish</cell><cell>kontrole</cell><cell>kontrol +DAT</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>popUlerliGini</cell><cell>popUler +DER lHg +POS2S +ACC,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>popUler +DER lHg +POS3 +ACC3</cell></row><row><cell>Arabic</cell><cell>Algbn</cell><cell>gabon POS:N Al+ +SG</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>AlmtHdp</cell><cell>mut aHidap POS:PN Al+ +SG,</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>mut aHid POS:AJ Al+ +SG</cell></row></table></figure>
