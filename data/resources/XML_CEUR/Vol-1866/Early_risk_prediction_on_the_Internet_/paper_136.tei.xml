<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Being depression a mental disorder that affects 1 in 10 people world-wide, it is important to react in an effective way before fatal decisions could be taken. Moreover, with the rise of social media, some issues regarding how to identify patterns of depressed users in a timely fashion is an important task that is attracting the attention from the NLP community. Accordingly, the CLEF 2017 launched a challenge to identify depressed users in reddit forums. Our proposal to attend this task was based on a two-step classification procedure, where we first look at the post level to create basic features that were then applied at user level, to build a profile for each user. To evaluate this methodology, we applied a 10-fold cross validation on the training data, obtaining an F-score of 0.73 in the identification of depressed users. For the CLEF challenge, our team reached the fourth place, obtaining an F-score of 0.48.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 1 in 10 adults will exhibit some kind of depression at some point in life <ref type="bibr" coords="1,392.27,512.66,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. People affected with depression suffer from feelings of hopelessness, loss of motivation, have sleep and eating disorders, and feel disconnected from other people. If untreated, depression can lead to suicide. Psychological criteria for detection of depression is presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), and consists of long-term (two or more years) behavioral analysis performed by a professional. This requires individuals to get diagnosed by a psychologist, something that many people are not willing or capable to do.</p><p>Online social platforms are quickly arising in popularity, becoming nearly ubiquitous in countries where internet is readily-available. These platforms allow people to share and express their thoughts and feelings freely and publicly with other people. As could be supposed, this information is a rich source for Natural Language Processing tasks such as: Opinion Mining <ref type="bibr" coords="1,362.23,656.12,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Sentiment Analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,470.08,656.12,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or inferring mental health issues <ref type="bibr" coords="2,275.97,118.99,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Following this last route, in this manuscript we approach the problem of predicting depressive users based on the analysis of posts that they share. Motivation for this task is that if depressive symptoms are accurately identified in a timely fashion, then, professionals could intervene before depression progresses. The approach that we introduce in this manuscript was submitted to the CLEF eRisk 2017 Challenge (Early Risk Prediction On The Internet). For this task, we were provided with a dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.95,190.72,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> built from reddit posts, grouped into anonymized users and ordered chronologically. reddit is an online discussion forum that covers a wide variety of topics. Content is organized into areas of interest called "subreddits", and it is there that threads are created and commented.</p><p>The proposed approach is based on a two-step classification procedure; the first step focuses on the analysis of individual posts by their content, whereas the second step considers the classification of users by their behaviors expressed by their kind of posts. The main idea behind our approach consists in modeling each user post, instead of directly modeling each user, under the assumption that each post is a window into the mind of a person in a particular point in time. Then, if we collect enough of these posts, we can observe how that person's mind changes -or do not -through time, in order to improve the model of each user. In our first set of experiments, we applied a 10-fold cross validation on the training data, obtaining a F1 score of 0.73 for predicting depressed individuals and above 0.90 for non-depressed individuals. For the challenge task, we ended up in the fourth place (out of eight teams) with an F-score of 0.48. Since our participation in the challenge was late, we only submitted predictions for the last part of the competition, so we would like to further analyze our model simulating their application at different levels of evidence for each user.</p><p>The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents some related work. In section 3 we describe our approach. Experimental Settings are presented in section 4, while results are presented in section 5. Finally, Conclusion is presented in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Social media platforms have become an attractive place to infer health related issues for entire communities or individual users. A study presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.66,536.57,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> compared online depression communities against control online communities, reporting that using topics and style markers as features showed good predictive power to differentiate between users. Two of the most common online platforms that have been used to mine this kind of data are Facebook and Twitter. In Facebook some efforts have been made to identify different contexts of depression. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.33,596.34,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, a study presents the case of predicting Postpartum Depression from shared data. While on <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.07,620.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the study focused on evaluating depressive symptoms through an application developed for Facebook. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,308.38,632.21,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the authors attempt to answer the question: what public health information could be learned from Twitter? Being Depression one of the most common ailments that could be associated to a cer-tain group of words. One of the former works to characterize depressed users in Twitter is <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.39,130.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where authors proposed some attributes to measure depressive behavior such as social engagement, language or emotion. The authors built a Support Vector Machine that achieved an score of 70% accuracy to predict, even prior to onset, depressive users. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,282.51,166.81,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Minsu et al. followed a qualitative study to investigate perception differences between depressed and non-depressed twitter users. They found that depressive users were more prone to perceive Twitter as a tool for social awareness and emotional interactions. More recently, Nadeem et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.26,214.64,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> compiled over 2.5M tweets to identify Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), with a reported accuracy of 81%. The authors claim that their method could even help estimate the risk of an individual being depressed. With a good number of studies focused on detecting depression, new works suggest the possibility of detecting other type of social phenomena like suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,429.02,262.46,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, no works have been done using reddit as a platform, being the dataset created by Losada and Crestani <ref type="bibr" coords="3,325.22,286.37,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> the first attempt to fill this gap. We will use this dataset for experimentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The two-step classification approach</head><p>This section presents an overview of the proposed two-step classification approach. The first step considers the analysis of individual posts by their content. Its aim is to discriminate messages produced by depressed and non-depressed users. Then, a second step analyzes this information with the aim of modeling the respective users' behaviors based on their category. The following explains in detail these two steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Post Level Analysis</head><p>The main goal of the first step is to classify each post as likely produced by a depressed or non-depressed person. For this, we train a classifier using user posts considering that all posts inherit the label from their respective author. More formally, let D = {(D 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (D n , y n )} be a training set of labeled userdocuments, that is, D is a collection of n-tuples of user-documents, i.e. posts, (D i ) and category-labels (y i ), where y i ∈ {depressed, non-depressed}. Also let D i = {(P 1 , y i ), . . . , (P n , y i )} be the set of posts from user D i . We represented each post P j by a feature vector P j that combines three different kinds of features: unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. For each individual feature space we considered the 10k top frequent items and then we selected all the features with information gain greater than zero. Additionally, we included two extra time attributes: the hour of the post and a binary attribute for whether or not it was posted on a weekend. Therefore, the final post representation P j is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,201.08,653.35,279.51,13.93">P j = P 1gram j , P 2gram j , P 3gram j , P time j , P weekend j (1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">User Level Analysis</head><p>The intuitive idea behind analyzing posts individually is that users can be understood in terms of their behavior, rather than by their vocabulary. Hence, in this second step we build the user representation by considering some statistics obtained from the first classification step.</p><p>Given a document D i , we first classify all its posts using the previous classifier (refer to Section 3.1). Then, we model D i as the sequence of predicted labels for each post P j ∈ D i , that is, D i = (y 1 , . . . , y h ), where y i corresponds to the predicted label of post P i . From this sequence of labels, we represent each user by a 12-dimensional vector D i including the features described below. For simplicity we will refer to a post as being "depressive" (or "non-depressive") depending if it was generated by a depressed or non-depressed user.</p><p>1. Percentage of posts that were classified as "depressive". 2. Percentage of posts that were classified as "non-depressive". 3. Percentage of times that a "non-depressive" post is followed by another "non-depressive" post. 4. Percentage of times that a "non-depressive" post is followed by a "depressive" post. 5. Percentage of times that a "depressive" post is followed by a "non-depressive" post. 6. Percentage of times that a "depressive" post is followed by another "depressive" post. 7. Percentage of "depressive" posts written in the morning. 8. Percentage of "non-depressive" posts written in the morning. 9. Percentage of "depressive" posts written in the evening. 10. Percentage of "non-depressive" posts written in the evening. 11. Percentage of "depressive" posts written in the night. 12. Percentage of "non-depressive" posts written in the night. Time periods were considered after analyzing heatmaps of users' activity, See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,165.75,474.65,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Accordingly, the periods that we consider were morning [6am-2pm], ii) evening [2pm-10pm], and iii) night [10pm-6am].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Settings</head><p>Dataset. For the evaluation we use the dataset presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,404.31,536.57,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This dataset is in XML format, where each user had a list of posts, and each post contained the following fields: title, date, info, and text. The info field simply contained the string "reddit post" and was discarded for not providing any relevant information. Title and text fields both contained useful information; they were merged into a "text" field. Preprocessing. Uppercase letters were turned to lowercase, numbers were removed, and negations were joined to the following word (i.e., "don't want" returns a single token "don't want"). Classification. For post and user classification we used a Naïve-Bayes Classifier (NBC). For validation we applied a stratified 10 fold-cross validation.</p><p>To evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed approach to identify depressed users from online forums, we compared its performance against a traditional text classification approach using a BOW representation. The first part of Table <ref type="table" coords="5,475.61,176.21,4.98,8.74">1</ref> shows the results from this comparison; they indicate that the two-step classification approach outperformed by more than 40% the baseline results. In order to evaluate the usefulness of some components of the proposed approach we carried out some experiments disabling some of them. In particular, we ran an experiment without considering the time information for the post representation and other using only word unigrams. The last two rows from Table <ref type="table" coords="5,424.80,247.95,4.98,8.74">1</ref> present the results from these two experiments; they clearly show that word sequences and time information are key elements in the classification of depressed posts and therefore on the identification of depressed users.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,163.01,319.07,4.13,7.89">1</ref>. F1 results: the proposed method, traditional text classification approach, and some variations of the method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F-Score</head><p>Proposed approach 0.9141 Traditional TC approach 0.7608 Proposed approach (without time information) 0.8508 Proposed approach (using only unigrams) 0.8316</p><p>An analysis on the relevance of the features showed us that the most discriminative n-grams were those related to the health condition of the users such as depression, diagnosis and therapy; this result was somehow expected due to the nature of the corpus. However, other n-grams related to feelings, news and interpersonal relationships were also highly discriminative for both kind of users. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,162.16,517.06,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">2</ref> shows the 40 most discriminative word n-grams. We also analyze the posting behavior of the users. The heatmaps in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,134.77,130.95,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show that there is a clear difference in the posting behaviors of both kinds of users, particularly on weekends. We expected depressed users to be more active during night, as people with depression also suffers from insomnia or has bad sleeping habits overall, but evidence showed us that it was the contrary, not depressed users were more active overall, except on weekends. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we presented our approach to identify depression through online publications, which is based on a two step analysis. The analysis of individual posts to characterize users' behavior was very useful in a second step to analyze the users from higher point of view. In this work, the general behavior of each user is captured by means of observing the posting history, especially the posting behavior and the posting period of time.</p><p>We presented experimental results of our method that shows to be useful compared with other methodologies. For this, we study the user-documents from different perspectives, including: post, and analysis of period of time. We found that both kinds of users can be differentiated by exploiting the time of publication, but more importantly, the changes in their behavior related to depressed and non-depressed posts. It was also found that both users have different activity during the weekend and during the day, which is valuable for future research paths.</p><p>Future work includes developing an early risk assessment strategy. We could not participate until late for this contest, and thus we did not develop an strategy for early risk assessment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,134.77,544.21,345.83,7.89;6,134.77,555.19,21.01,7.86;6,134.77,210.40,345.84,319.04"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
