<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The WHO (World Health Organization) reports that "the number of people suffering from depression and/or anxiety increased by almost 50% from 416 million to 615 million" from 1990 to 2013 <ref type="foot" coords="1,324.43,397.34,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance also estimates that "major depressive disorder affects approximately 14.8 million American adults" and "annual toll on U.S. businesses amounts to about $70 billion in medical expenditures, lost productivity and other costs" (http://www.dbsalliance.org).</p><p>Depression detection is crucial and many studies are devoted to this challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.77,470.72,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. While there are clinical factors that can help for early detection of patients at risk for depression <ref type="bibr" coords="1,231.15,482.68,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, in this paper we present our approach to help early depression detection from social media analysis, as part of our participation to CLEF e-risk 2017 pilot task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,259.58,506.59,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Recent related work focus on people communication and social media post analysis to detect depression. Rude's study shows that depressed people tend to use the personal pronoun ("I") more intensively than others <ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.90,542.53,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Other features have also been noticed. For example, De Choudhury et al. noticed that the depressive people show less activity during the day and more activity during the night <ref type="bibr" coords="1,177.89,578.39,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Schwartz at al. reported that depressive people tend to use swear words and talk more about the past <ref type="bibr" coords="1,295.16,590.35,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>These previous studies show that some cues and features extracted from social media posts can be related to depression. In this paper, we report our investigations on using various features in order to answer the e-risk challenge as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.33,118.99,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The e-risk pilot task aims to detect a depressive person as soon as possible by analysing her or his posts in Reddit<ref type="foot" coords="2,376.68,129.37,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> that are provided as a simulated data flow.</p><p>In our participation runs, the features we used to characterize posts are of two types: lexicon-based (extracted using NLTK toolkit<ref type="foot" coords="2,363.98,166.16,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> ) and numerical features. These features are used in a machine learning method using Weka.</p><p>The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the model we used. Section 3 details the different features we implemented to train different models. In Section 4 we detail the 4 runs we have submitted and the underlying models and present the results. In Section 5 we discuss the results and depict future work.  The model is composed of three modules. In the first one, we pre-process the XML files that contain the users' posts. The second module aims at extracting the features. Notice that while some features capture information from any textual parts, others focus either on the Title part (corresponding to the initial post) or on the Text part which corresponds to comments on the initial post. The feature extraction module is extensible: while we developed some features, new features can easily be added. Then, in the formatting module, we select a subset of the features to be used in the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Features and models</head><p>We developed different types of features. Some have linguistic foundation while others are more statistically-based. We distinguish lexicon-based features from other numerical features.</p><p>For lexicon-based features, we rely either on previous observations on depressive subjects' behaviour <ref type="bibr" coords="3,241.78,341.32,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.95,341.32,12.73,8.74" target="#b10">11]</ref> or on hypothesis that we wanted to evaluate.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,176.36,356.46,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the features that rely on a lexicon. Each feature is calculated as follows: (a) we extract the considered lexicon words from each user's post, (b) for a given user, each lexicon word is weighted by the normalized word frequency (division of the frequency by the total number of words in the user's posts), (c) we then create one feature by averaging the obtained weights over the lexicon words.</p><p>Features are calculated for each user as follows: we first calculate the feature value for each of his or her post or comment, then we average the value over his or her posts in the chunk ; when several chunks are used, we average the feature values obtained for each chunk for the considered user.</p><p>We also used some other numerical features that are described in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,472.84,482.38,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The details of the features are described in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,325.13,494.33,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>We submitted 4 runs corresponding to 4 models. The features that were used for each model are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,308.14,521.43,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. While we used model GPLA to start with, the other models were introduced later on. The second column of Table <ref type="table" coords="3,475.61,533.38,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> indicates the chunk number when each model was introduced. The 4 runs corresponding to our 4 models were performed with the Random Forest learning algorithm under the Weka platform using the default parameters.</p><p>In order to decide whether to issue a decision for a subject or wait for more chunks, we used the prediction confidence rate that Weka generates for each prediction. We set a threshold (estimated using samples of depressive subjects) and we only issued decisions that had a prediction confidence that exceeds the selected threshold. The evolution of the threshold for each model through the runs and according to the chunks can be tracked using Table <ref type="table" coords="3,408.23,644.16,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, a threshold of 0.5 basically means that all predictions are considered.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The evaluation takes into account not only the correctness of the output of the system (i.e. whether or not the user is depressed) but also the delay taken to emit its decision. To this aim, the ERDE (Early Risk Detection Error ) metric proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,187.65,596.18,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is used. This measure rewards early alerts and the delay taken by the system to make its decision is measured by counting the number of distinct textual items seen before giving the answer.</p><p>Our best results when considering ERDE measures are obtained using model GPLC which does not use POS results nor the most frequent n-grams. Including them in the model slightly improves F1 measure mainly because of higher recall (0.60 against 0.50) (see Table <ref type="table" coords="5,265.10,549.25,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Our run GPLB had the 2nd best Recall (0.83) across participants and GPLA the 5 th .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In the runs we submitted we consider 19 features. However, some additional features are worth studying. In future work, we aim at considering temporal features such as the date of the posts, part of the day, etc. Moreover, we would like to modify the way features are calculated : in the case of lexicon-based features, each lexicon item would be a distinct feature. By this way, we would obtained a richer representation of each user and potentially a better detection.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,134.77,305.35,222.61,8.74"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 presents an overview of the model we use.</figDesc></figure>
