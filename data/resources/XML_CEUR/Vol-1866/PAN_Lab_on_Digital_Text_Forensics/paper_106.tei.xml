<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper deals with the sub-task of PAN 2017 Author Identification, which is to detect style breaches for unknown number of authors within a single document in English. The presented model is an unsupervised approach that will detect style breaches and mark text boundaries on the basis of different stylistic features. This model will use some classical stylistic features like POS analysis and sentence lexical analysis. Also some new features naming common English word frequencies within sentence text, sentence expression and sentence attitude have been proposed. The new features may not be directly linked to author's style of writing but to the subject/topic of sentence under analysis. Moreover the model uses sentence window for style detection. The sentence window may be extended to neighboring sentences during its unsupervised analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Stylometry is an important tool in the field of digital text forensics, especially in cases where we have unidentified or dubious text documents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,382.39,508.69,11.69,9.05">[1]</ref> written by one or more authors. These documents do not have an external link, tool or repository to prove that which text passage relates to which author. In other words, we use stylometric approaches when we may have to ascertain if the acclaimed authorship of text document actually exists in circumstances where we do not have any external verification resources.</p><p>Stylometric approaches generally achieve higher accuracy for long documents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,458.90,577.69,11.91,9.05" target="#b0">[2]</ref> because longer documents contain more text to reveal stylistic features of authors like in the field of Intrinsic Plagiarism detection problem solving <ref type="bibr" coords="1,378.86,600.61,11.30,9.05" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,393.77,600.61,7.27,9.05" target="#b2">4]</ref>. But in cases of short documents or texts e.g. in cases of social media like twitter where there may be fewer sentences by each author, Stylometric approaches my not get more accurate results. Although much work has been done in cases of scam emails <ref type="bibr" coords="1,401.55,635.17,10.71,9.05" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, cyber-crimes <ref type="bibr" coords="1,124.82,646.69,11.72,9.05" target="#b4">[6]</ref> and fake service provision reviews <ref type="bibr" coords="1,280.25,646.69,11.72,9.05" target="#b5">[7]</ref> using Stylometric models.</p><p>One way of using stylometric approach in case of author attribution and author profiling is by training the computer applications over specific writing style of some specific author in a number of documents. But as discussed above the task of detecting style breaches within a document without knowing in advance about the exact number of authors is difficult task and also an objective for ongoing research. Detection of style breach is related to text segmentation where text boundaries are marked with detection in change of topics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,294.98,184.04,10.67,9.05" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The presented model uses unsupervised classification approach to detect and mark passage boundaries in given documents on the basis of style breaches. A combination of well-known stylometric features like Syntactic, Lexical and content specific features <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.02,230.00,11.72,9.05" target="#b7">[9]</ref> are used with features like ordinary words frequency, sentence expression and sentence attitude that may be related to textual topic specification and may not be directly related to author's style. But this approach may be very handy in cases where we want to relate one sentence to its neighboring sentences and thus detect exact passage boundaries within a given document.</p><p>Also this model is a good example of how a text as small as a sentence within a document may be helpful in finding its related sentences on the basis of stylometric and other parameters to help us figure-out the passage boundaries by unknown number of authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Dataset</head><p>The training dataset of PAN at CLEF 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,334.27,387.35,11.69,9.05" target="#b6">[8]</ref> for the task of style breach detection under main task of author identification. The dataset contained about 187 English text documents of different lengths and sizes over different topics like biography, politics, travel, hotels etc. Along with each text document a truth file was provided which contained exact character positions indicating style breach occurrences within that document, topic of document however remains unchanged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System Methodology</head><p>The presented model uses different types of classical stylometric methods along with some new methods in order to find text borders where style breach is identified. The system used sentences as text segmentation unit. The sentence window keeps extending over its neighboring sentences until style breach is detected. Following are the methodology steps used by the system in order to find out style breaches. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Words Lists Preparation</head><p>Different types of lists of words were prepared from different internet sources <ref type="bibr" coords="3,455.02,176.12,15.80,9.05">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.82,187.64,12.55,9.05">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.74,187.64,12.44,9.05">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.54,187.64,8.90,9.05">13</ref>] that express specific moods or human feelings. Seven expression lists of words were used including anger, confusion, curiosity, urgency, satisfaction, inspiration and happiness; where all lists comprised of about 200 words each. One reason for choosing only these seven expressions was the availability of proper expressive words over internet sources for these expressions. The second reason was to use limited set of expressions that may express human feelings while writing some text. More expressions may be included for future research. Two words additional words lists of about 500 words each of which reflecting positive or negative attitudes [14, 15] were included. An example of these expressive and attitude lists is shown in table <ref type="table" coords="3,146.76,291.23,4.98,9.05" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="3,171.20,291.23,25.70,9.05" target="#tab_1">table 2</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,130.22,680.44,321.30,9.05">---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------</formula><p>These lists became the part of model and will be used for labeling of sentences in next methodology steps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>A number of experiments were carried out in order to adjust the threshold values and for which the final F-Measure score was highest.

The results were improved for the final test dataset, however the model precision remained low from recall and that affected the final F-Measure score, which shows that more experiments over different data sources for adjusting threshold values may be required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper an unsupervised model for the detection of style breach is presented, this research field is rather new and more difficult to implement because non availability of any external resources for reference and also we only have to rely on stylistic attributes of unknown number authors that may or may not have contributed in the creation of text document under inquiry, hence this model presents new directions or ways i.e. Expression and Attitude labeling of textual windows in order to find style breach within sentences without the pre-assumption of authors style of writing and relying more on text content. In future the results can be improved with discovery of more text labels or with the addition of more expression lists and reduction of conventional stylistic approaches, this model can hence be applied to other languages as well.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,163.82,579.85,111.41,9.05;2,163.82,592.09,150.92,9.05;2,163.82,604.33,186.76,9.05;2,163.82,616.57,177.79,9.05;2,163.82,628.69,192.00,9.05;2,181.85,639.43,168.59,9.83;2,181.85,650.95,156.00,9.83;2,163.82,664.00,114.06,9.05"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Words lists preparation  Text segmentation into sentences  Sentence window based syntactic analysis  Sentence window based lexical analysis  Content based analysis of sentence window  Sentence window expression labeling  Sentence window attitude labeling  Style breach calculation</figDesc></figure>
