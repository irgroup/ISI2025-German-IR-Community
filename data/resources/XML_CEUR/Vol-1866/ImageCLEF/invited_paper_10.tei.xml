<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the increasing number of successful related workshops and panels, lifelogging has rarely been the subject of a rigorous comparative benchmarking exercise. Following the success of the new lifelog evaluation task at NTCIR-12, 1 the first ImageCLEF 2017 LifeLog task aims to bring the attention of lifelogging to a wide audience and to promote research into some of the key challenges of the coming years. The ImageCLEF 2017 LifeLog task aims to be a comparative evaluation framework for information access and retrieval systems operating over personal lifelog data. Two subtasks were available to participants; all tasks use a single mixed modality data source from three lifeloggers for a period of about one month each. The data contains a large collection of wearable camera images, an XML description of the semantic locations, as well as the physical activities of the lifeloggers. Additional visual concept information was also provided by exploiting the Caffe CNN-based visual concept detector. For the two sub-tasks, 51 topics were chosen based on the real interests of the lifeloggers. In this first year three groups participated in the task, submitting 19 runs across all subtasks, and all participants also provided working notes papers. In general, the groups performance is very good across the tasks, and there are interesting insights into these very relevant challenges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The availability of a large variety of personal devices, such as smartphones, video cameras as well as wearable devices that allow capturing pictures, videos and audio clips of every moment of our life is creating vast archives of personal data where the totality of an individual's experiences, captured multi-modally through digital sensors are stored permanently as a personal multimedia archive. These unified digital records, commonly referred to as lifelogs, have gathered increasing attention in recent years within the research community. This happened due to the need for, and challenge of, building systems that can automatically analyse these huge amounts of data in order to categorize, summarize and query them to retrieve information that the user may need. For example, lifeloggers may want to recall some events that they do not remember clearly or to know some insights of their activities at work to improve the performance. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,475.61,190.72,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of what a lifelogger wants to retrieve. The ImageCLEF 2017 LifeLog task is inspired by the general image annotation and retrieval tasks that have been part of ImageCLEF since 2003. In the early years the focus was on retrieving relevant images from a web collection given (multilingual) queries, from 2006 onwards annotation tasks were also held, initially aimed at object detection, but more recently also covering semantic concepts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.55,476.68,11.88,8.74" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.42,476.68,11.88,8.74" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.30,476.68,11.88,8.74" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.18,476.68,11.88,8.74" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In the last two editions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.39,476.68,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.91,476.68,7.01,8.74" target="#b4">5]</ref>, the image annotation task was expanded to concept localization and also natural language sentential description of images. As there is an increased interest in recent years in research combining text and vision, this year task, changing a little the focus of the retrieval object, aim at further stimulating and encouraging multi-modal research that uses text and visual data, and natural language processing for image retrieval and summarization.</p><p>This paper presents the overview of the first edition of the ImageCLEF 2017 LifeLog task, one of the four benchmark campaigns organized by ImageCLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="2,470.08,575.81,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in 2017 under the CLEF initiative <ref type="foot" coords="2,287.03,586.19,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Section 2 describes the task in detail, including the participation rules and the provided data and resources. Section 3 presents and discusses the results of the submissions received for the task. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper with final remarks and future outlooks.</p><p>2 Overview of the Task</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Motivation and Objectives</head><p>Based on the successful of NTCIR-12 lifelog task, we present here new tasks which aim to advance the state-of-the-art research in lifelogging as an application of information retrieval. By proposing these tasks at ImageCLEF, we intent to enlarge the association, by linking lifelogging researchers to the image retrieval community. We also hope that novel approaches based on multi-modal retrieval will be able to provide new insights from the personal lifelogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Challenge Description</head><p>The ImageCLEF 2017 LifeLog task<ref type="foot" coords="3,294.01,271.27,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> aims to be a comparative evaluation of information access and retrieval systems operating over personal lifelog data. The task consisted of two sub-tasks, both allow participation independently. These sub-tasks are:</p><p>-Lifelog Retrieval Task (LRT); -Lifelog Summarization Task (LST).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifelog retrieval task</head><p>The participants had to analyse the lifelog data and for several specific queries, return the correct answers. For example: Shopping for Wine: Find the moment(s) when I was shopping for wine in the supermarket or The Metro: Find the moment(s) when I was riding a metro. The ground truth for this sub-task was created by extending the queries from the NTCIR-12 dataset, which already provides a sufficient ground truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifelog summarization task</head><p>In this sub-task the participants had to analyse all the images and summarize them according to specific requirements. For instance: Public Transport: Summarize the use of public transport by a user. Taking any form of public transport is considered relevant, such as bus, taxi, train, airplane and boat. The summary should contain all different day-times, means of transport and locations, etc.</p><p>Particular attention had to be paid to the diversification of the selected images with respect to the target scenario. The ground truth for this sub-task was created utilizing crowdsourcing and manual annotations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dataset</head><p>The Lifelog dataset<ref type="foot" coords="3,218.79,600.46,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> consists of data from three lifeloggers for a period of about one month each. The data contains 88, 124 wearable camera images (approximately two images per minute), an XML description of 130 associated semantic  <ref type="table" coords="4,472.84,239.70,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>In order to reduce the barriers-to-participation, the output of the Caffe CNNbased visual concept detector <ref type="bibr" coords="4,264.01,263.61,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> was included in the test collection as additional metadata. This classifier provided labels and probabilities for 1,000 objects in every image. The accuracy of the Caffe visual concept detector is variable and is representative of the current generation of off-the-shelf visual analytics tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Topic and Ground-truth</head><p>Aside from the data, the test collection included a set of topics (queries) that were representative of the real-world information needs of lifeloggers. There were 36 ad-hoc search topics, 16 for the development set and 20 for the test set, representing the challenge of retrieval for the LRT task (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,441.88,385.16,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,471.74,385.16,4.43,8.74">3</ref>) and 15 search topics, 5 for the development set and 10 for the test set, for the Summarization sub-task (see Tables <ref type="table" coords="4,293.62,409.07,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="4,320.63,409.07,3.87,8.74">5</ref>). For full descriptions of the topics, please see the Appendix A.</p><p>The ground-truth of retrieval topics were created by the task organizers, with the verification of the lifeloggers. For summarization topics, task organizers manually classified the images into the clusters which are provided by the lifeloggers. All the results are then verified by the lifeloggers once more time before publishing. T2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Performance Measures</head><p>For the Lifelog Rerieval Task evaluation metrics based on NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) at different depths were used, i.e., N DCG@N , where N varies based on the type of the topics, for the recall oriented topics N was larger (&gt; 20), and for the precision oriented topics N was smaller N (5, 10 or 20).</p><p>In the Lifelog Summarization Task classic metrics were deployed:</p><p>-Cluster Recall at X(CR@X) a metric that assesses how many different clusters from the ground truth are represented among the top X results; -Precision at X(P @X) measures the number of relevant photos among the top X results; -F1-measure at X(F 1@X) the harmonic mean of the previous two.</p><p>Various cut off points were considered, e.g., X = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Official ranking metrics this year was the F1-measure@10 or images, which gives equal importance to diversity (via CR@10) and relevance (via P @10).</p><p>Participants were also encouraged to undertake the sub-tasks in an interactive or automatic manner. For interactive submissions, a maximum of five minutes of search time was allowed per topic. In particular, the organizers would like to emphasize methods that allowed interaction with real users (via Relevance Feedback (RF), for example), i.e., beside of the best performance, the way of interaction (like number of iterations using RF), or innovation level of the method (for example, new way to interact with real users) has been evaluated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Participation</head><p>This year, being the fist edition of this challenging task, the participation was not so high but, taking into account the number of teams that downloaded the dataset (11 registered teams signed the copyright form), there are grounds for this number to increase considerably over coming iterations of the task. In total the three groups that took part in the task and submitted overall 19 runs. All three participating groups submitted a working paper describing their system, thus for these there were specific details available:</p><p>-I2R: <ref type="bibr" coords="9,170.20,118.99,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref> The team from Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, represented by Ana Garcia del Molino, Bappaditya Mandal, Jie Lin, Joo Hwee Lim, Vigneshwaran Subbaraju and Vijay Chandrasekhar. -UPB: <ref type="bibr" coords="9,175.92,166.69,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> The team from University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania, represented by Mihai Dogariu and Bogdan Ionescu. -Organizers: <ref type="bibr" coords="9,205.40,190.48,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref> The team from Insight Centre for Data Analytics (Dublin City University), University of Cagliari, Simula Research Laboratory, University of Trento, was represented by Liting Zhou, Luca Piras, Michael Rieger, Giulia Boato, Duc-Tien Dang-Nguyen, and Cathal Gurrin.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,161.12,247.64,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">6</ref> provide the main key details for the submitted runs of each group describing their system for each subtask.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results for Subtask 1: Retrieval</head><p>Unfortunately only the Organizers team submitted runs for the Retrieval Subtask <ref type="bibr" coords="9,155.61,344.28,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. They proposed an approach composed by several step. First of all they grouped similar moments together based on time and concepts and, applying this chronological-based segmentation, they turned the problem of images retrieval into image segments retrieval. Then, starting from a topic query, they transformed it into small inquiries, where each of them is asking for a single piece of information of concepts, location, activity, and time. The moments that matched all of those requirements are returned as the retrieval results. In the end, in order to remove non-relevant images, a filtering step is applied on the retrieved images, by removing blurred and images that covered mainly by huge object or by the arms of the user. On the Retrieval Subtask the Organizers team submitted 3 runs summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,172.63,475.79,4.98,8.74">7</ref> The first run (baseline) exploited only time and the concepts information. Every single image has been considered as the basic unit and the retrieval just returns all images that contains the concepts extracted from the topics. They submitted this run as reference with the purpose that any other approach should obtain better performance than this. In the second run (Segmentation), the Organizers team introduced also the segmentation so as basic unit of retrieval has been used the segment, not image. In the last run (Fine-Tuning), the "translation" of the query into small inquiries has been applied.</p></div>

Team</head><p>Description NDCG</p><p>Organizers <ref type="bibr" coords="10,272.15,597.27,14.34,7.86" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Baseline 0.09 Segmentation 0.14 Fine-Tuning 0.39 I2R achieved the best F1@10 measure (excluding the organizers' runs) of 0.497 by building a multi-step approach. As first step they filtered out unin- formative images, i.e., the ones with very homogeneous colors and with a high blurriness. Then the system ranked the remaining images and clustered the top ranked images into a series of events using either k-means or a hierarchical tree. As final step they selected, in an iterative manner, as many images per cluster as to fill a size budget. They submitted two different sets of runs: automatic (Run 1-3,6-9) and interactive (Run 4, 5, and 10). In the first ones in order to select the key-frames, all frames in each cluster are ranked according to distance to the cluster center (for k-means clustering) or relevance score (for hierarchical trees), then, the selection is sorted according to each frames relevance score. In the interactive process, they give the user the opportunity of removing, replacing and adding frames refining the automatically generated summary. They obtained the best result in the Run 2 where used visual and metadata information and automatic frame selection. It is worth to note that, on the contrary, the organizers team considerably improved the results of theie automatic approach with the Fine Tuning introducing the human-in-the-loop, i.e., thanks to relevance feedback.</p><p>UPB team proposed an approach that combines textual and visual information in the process of selecting the best candidates for the tasks requirements. The run that they submitted relied solely on the information provided by the organizers and no additional annotations or external data, nor feedback from the users had been employed. Additionally, a multi-stage approach has been used. The algorithm starts by analyzing the concept detectors output provided by the organizers and selecting for each image only the most probable concepts. From the list of the topics, each of them has been then parsed such that only relevant words have been kept and information regarding location, activity and the targeted user are extracted as well. The images that did not fit the topic requirements have been removed and this shortlist of images is then subject to a clustering step. Finally, the results are pruned with the help of a similarity scores computed using WordNets builtin similarity distance functions.</p><p>The Organizers team submitted 5 runs for the Summarization Subtask applying the same strategy as in the retrieval subtask, in which the first three runs were to test the automatic approach with the increasing level of the 'criteria' as proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="12,198.96,214.69,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, while the last two runs are used to test the fine tuning and the relevance feedback approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="12,267.60,226.64,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For the relevance feedback approach, they ran a simulation by exploiting the ground-truth annotated data. The results confirm what is highlighted in Section 3.2; applying segmentation improved both retrieval and summarization performance. From Table <ref type="table" coords="12,329.76,262.51,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">8</ref> it is quite clear that applying finetunning significantly improved performance but what is worth to note is the big gaps in results between the automatic approach with the fine-tunning and the fine-tunning with the human-in-the-loop (relevance feedback) approaches. This shows that a better natural language processing is needed as well as machine learning studies in this field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Limitations of the challenge</head><p>The major limitation that we learned from the task is about the difficulty of the topics. Many topics require huge effort on natural language processing to make the system understand the topics, which limit major of the teams, which are mainly from the image retrieval community. We also learned that the scope of the subtasks should be better defined since the summarization subtask already covers the retrieval task. As the result, most of the teams only interested in doing the second subtask.</p><p>As the ultimate goal is to provide insights from lifelogs, the current two subtasks only provide basic information, which is far away meaningful information. Thus, a subtask that better focuses on the quantified self, i.e., knowledge mined from self-tracking data, should be considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussions and Conclusions</head><p>A large gap between signed-up teams and submitted runs from the teams was observed. This can have two reasons, (i) due to the amount of data that has to be processed some teams might not be able to do so. (ii) the task seemed to be very complex requiring participants not just only to process single types of data but different ones such as audio and video, etc. For future iterations of the task it will be important to support teams by providing pre-extracted features or maybe access to hardware for the computation. Nevertheless, the submitted runs show that multimodal analysis is not used often. A closer contact with the teams during the whole task could help to find out individual bottle necks of the teams that prevents them from using other modalities and support them to overcome these bottlenecks. All in all the task was quite successful for the first year and tacking into account that lifelogging is a rather new and not common field. The task helped to raise more awareness for lifelogging in general but also to point at the potential research questions such as the previous mentioned multimodal analysis, system aspects for efficiency, etc. For a possible next iteration of the task the dataset should be enchanced with more data and pre-extracted visual and multi-modal features. Furthermore, a platform should be established that can help the organizers to communicate and support the participants during their participation period.</p></div>
