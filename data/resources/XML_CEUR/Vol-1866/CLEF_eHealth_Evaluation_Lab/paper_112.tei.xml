<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This working note presents the approach used to annotate and detect WHO ICD-10 codes in two datasets of death certificates: one in French and another one in English. The work has been done during the eHealth challenge 2017 in the task 1 for multilingual information extraction task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,376.86,451.12,10.04,8.80" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. eHealth challenge is part of the labs in the CLEF 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,294.08,463.07,10.72,8.80" target="#b3">[4]</ref> conference in the fields of multilingual and multimodal information access evaluation. The present document describes the tasks performed in Section 2, followed by the objectives to achieve by the experiments in Section 3. Section 4 provides the description of the approach Section 5 gives an overview of the resources used by our approach. Furthermore, we provide the results in Section 6, with a brief analysis of some insights in Section 7 before giving some perspectives to improve the current work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Tasks Performed</head><p>We have performed the following tasks:</p><p>-Transform all the datasets into the RDF <ref type="bibr" coords="1,330.26,609.33,10.41,8.80" target="#b1">[2]</ref> model for a graph-based manipulation -Transform/convert the dictionaries received for the challenge for all the years into the Simple Knowledge Organisation vocabulary SKOS <ref type="bibr" coords="1,422.82,645.10,10.72,8.80" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for better enrichment across the knowledge-base.</p><p>-Design a GATE <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.06,119.93,10.72,8.80" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,241.78,119.93,7.90,8.80" target="#b4">5]</ref> workflow to annotate the RDF datasets based on Gazetteers extracted from the dictionaries -Work on both French (raw data) and English corpus on a single workflow, in a multilingual approach. Thus, we are able to handle more languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Main objectives of experiments</head><p>The main objectives are to retrieve the relevant ICD-10 codes in a text field of a CertDC document line by line as they are provided in the dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Description of the Approach</head><p>The so-called approach "Not Only NLP" (NoNLP) is a combination of NLP technique for entity extraction from text based on GATE annotator and the extensive use of RDF model for data manipulation within the system and to further enrich the data as a knowledge base. NLP helps using GATE pipeline We use the Content Augmentation Manager (CA-Manager) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,382.03,341.36,10.01,8.80" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a semantic tool for knowledge extraction from unstructured data (text, image, etc) and a knowledge manager, able to handle both the model and the data in RDF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Content Annotation</head><p>The annotation process employed is based on a central component: the Content Augmentation Manager (CA-Manager). CA-Manager is in charge of processing any type of content (plain text, XML, HTML, PDF, etc). This module extracts the concepts and entities detected using text mining techniques with the text input module. The strength of CA-Manager is to combine semantic technologies with a UIMA-based infrastructure<ref type="foot" coords="2,283.72,480.06,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_0">1</ref> which has been enriched and customized to address the specific needs of both semantic annotation and ontology population tasks.</p><p>In the scenario presented in this paper, we use the GATE framework for the entity extraction. CA-Manager uses an ontology-based annotation schema to transform heterogeneous content (text, image, video, etc.) into semanticallydriven and organized one. The overall architecture of CA-Manager is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,166.16,565.98,3.87,8.80" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We first create the gazetteer with the SKOS document obtained from the experts. We then launch in parallel 10 documents in multi-threads containing text information represented by each row in the CSV. The annotation report contains the valid knowledge section, an RDF/XML document containing the Uniform Resources Identifiers (URIs) of the concepts detected by the annotator. Finally, a SPARQL update query is launched to update the dataset containing the all the data in RDF. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">CA-Manager Configuration</head><p>We use an approach composed of three main steps:</p><p>1. First we generate the gazetteer to be used for the annotations by SKOSification process. 2. Second: we prepare a workflow suitable for our use case, such as defining how to deal with languages, text accentuation, etc. (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,391.80,417.41,3.87,8.80">2</ref>). This includes:</p><p>the conversion of all the test data from CSV into RDF by using a model (ontology) to transform them into RDF. -The actual annotation to extract the pertinent concepts to enrich the initial dataset of test data into an endpoint. 3. Third: We proceed then to enriching the dataset in the endpoint by associating each URI detected in the annotation phase with its relevant code number (which is a property) of the SKOS concept. Finally, a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query is then launched to create the result output in CSV based on the specification of the challenge.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,181.43,549.46,5.03,8.80">3</ref> provides a big picture of the NoNLP approach. The process starts with the data conversion in RDF of the dictionaries to generate the gazetteers using SKOS2GATE. The dictionaries is used as configured in the GATE workflow for the annotation by CA-Manager, together with the test dataset already converted into RDF. The result is a set of files representing the valid knowledge in RDF/XML with the entities detected and the associated URI as described in the Gazetteer dataset. All the files output of CA-Manager are merged into the triple store where each piece of information is manipulated by an URI with the associated ICD-10 code if available. The enriched dataset can be exported into CSV according to the specifications of the challenge </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Gazetteer Generation</head><p>We first model all the dictionaries received in RDF using SKOS vocabulary 2 . Each element in the dictionary is a SKOS:Concept, and different concepts in different years have different skos:inScheme property. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,405.93,119.93,4.95,8.80" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows a sample view for the concept CANCER modeled in SKOS with the attributes attached to describe the concept in our scenario. This dataset is used as input of our tool SKOS2GATE which transforms the RDF file into list of terms or Gazetteers with some normalization process within the configuration. The configuration file used for creating the dictionary contains two major information:</p><p>-Name of the Java class of the morphological analyzer used to lemmatize labels, one per language. -The indication to convert all the labels to lower case in the dictionary. This is the only normalization we made that affect the dictionary. The choice is guided by the characteristics of the text being analyzed, as we are using exact matching with the terms during the entity detection process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Data Modeling</head><p>NoNLP assumes that all the data manipulated are graphs. So, we transform into RDF all the test data to be used in our experiments. The benefits here is that each element of the graph is described by a unique URI to identify a single resource and to be used for merging information attached to it. The input of the annotator is not anymore a document, but a concept with properties representing the actual document to be processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Resources</head><p>We solely used the raw data received without additional extra data. Hence we used the following datasets in their original version received for the challenge:</p><p>-All the dictionaries in CSV for French dataset from 2006 to 2015.</p><p>-The test dataset "AlignedCauses_2014test.csv" in the French dataset.</p><p>-The American dictionary provided in CSV for the English terms.</p><p>-The test corpus with data for 2015  <ref type="table" coords="6,234.57,240.62,4.13,7.93">2</ref>. Results of the run for French raw corpus However, we do not use the training data, which is one of the weakness of the approach as described in the working notes. We left that for future work as it will help detect patterns to write suitable JAPE rules for the annotator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>With the help of the organizers, the scores of the output of our runs were computed using the evaluation program. The unofficial scores were obtained after converting them to the expected challenge csv format. The scores are as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">EN-RAW Data</head><p>We ran the EN corpus containing 14,833 pieces of text in our annotator. The goal was to find in each text the ICD-10 SKOS concept present in the Gazetteer by using an exactMatch approach. The score for this dataset is presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,134.27,476.80,3.87,8.80" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We obtained a precision of 69% and a recall of almost 31%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">FR-RAW data</head><p>We ran the FR corpus (raw dataset) containing 59,176 pieces of text in our annotator. The results in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,271.35,540.03,4.88,8.80">2</ref> show a low precision (37.51%) compared to the EN run.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Analysis of the results</head><p>The results show that we detect better for the English corpus than for the French one. We obtained both high precision and recall with the English corpus, while in French corpus we obtained lower recall. Additionally, our approach seems to work better in English corpus than French, by a factor of 2x. This shows that our system can benefits from the training dataset by adding more alternative labels in general, and in particular by adding some extra normalization based on some patterns that could be observed in the training dataset. We can improve the current scores if we use the training dataset received during this challenge. Our current approach did not make use of the development data so as to help detect patterns to use for creating pattern-matching grammars (JAPE) <ref type="bibr" coords="7,420.52,167.75,10.55,8.80" target="#b7">[8]</ref> rules. This can be seen as the basic result that just needs further tuning when exploiting training dataset. We need to understand better the French dataset to enrich our Gazetteers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Future Work</head><p>The approach presented in this working notes does not make use of all the power of Semantic technologies, such as the use of the classification rules or inference. We have considered the resources without any hierarchy or relations such as broader, narrower, etc. It could have been possible to have more detected entities based on the relationships within the IC10 concepts. Also, we do not use the training set to add a "learning module" both to improve the gazetteers and then to detect more ICD-10 code. We plan to add JAPE rules based on the patterns detected in the "Gold standard" to improve the GATE workflow detection, and complete the normalization of the gazetteers with additional variations in the label.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,207.90,302.57,199.56,7.93;3,154.68,116.83,306.00,171.00"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
