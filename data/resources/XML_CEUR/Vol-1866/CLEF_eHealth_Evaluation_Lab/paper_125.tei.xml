<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, we used a deep model architecture to identify DTA studies pertaining to a given review topic. We were provided the list of relevant documents selected based on abstracts and full text for different reviews topics. We extracted the abstract and title to be used as features to describe those documents, and learned the deep neural net model that takes as input the abstract and title of the studies, and topic of the review to obtain a binary classification of whether that study is a relevant DTA to the review in question.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>The proposed model takes as input the title and abstract of the paper as sequences of words. These are then fed into the embeddings layer that outputs a matrix of words vectors corresponding to the given words. It is then passed through a 1-dimensional convolution layer of filter length 3. Similarly, the topic of the review in question is also passed through the embedding layer and into the convolution layer of filter length 3. The embeddings generated by the three different convolution layers are then merged, and passed through a dense fully connected layer with dropout, and sigmoid activation function for output. The loss function used at the output layer is binary cross-entropy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Tuning</head><p>All the parameters were tuned on a held out validation dataset. The probabilities of dropout were tuned over a range of 10 equidistant values in the interval [0, 1]. The optimal value of dropout probability obtained was 0.6. The structure of the network was also trained on the held out validation dataset. We experimented with different filter lengths, and different number of convolution layers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In previous work, we have built a classifier which, when presented with an unknown citation (i.e. title/abstract), can predict whether it describes a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) or not. Performance and technical details can be found in Wallace et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,234.37,584.39,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The performance of this classifier on studies retrieved in searches for systematic reviews is good, and can reduce the manual screening burden by up to 80% while maintaining 100% recall. This is potentially very useful, but it is able to do this because: 1) it has been built on a large unbiased training dataset of 280,000 manually-labelled citations; and 2) the searches for systematic reviews of RCTs retrieve a large number of references which are not RCTs.  We appear to have a different situation with regards to DTA studies. We do not have the luxury of a large dataset on which to build a DTA classifier. The data presented for this exercise, for example, are the result of searches and screening decisions for DTA systematic reviews -rather than searches and screening decisions for DTAs. This means that the negative class in the DTA dataset contains large numbers of DTA studies, because they were irrelevant for the specific DTA review in question. This makes it impossible to use this dataset to build a generic DTA classifier. Moreover, we also built a DTA classifier from records we obtained outside this dataset -approximately 1,500 records which were manually labelled as to whether they described a DTA study or not. The results obtained, when using this classifier against the DTA training dataset for this task are shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,308.63,656.12,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="4,339.00,656.12,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Other than a small boost at the bottom left of the graph in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,312.86,118.99,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we can see that this classifier does not perform well. Especially, in comparison to the results of the deep model presented in the previous section.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,196.89,652.53,221.59,8.74"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Deep Model Architecture used for the Task.</figDesc></figure>
