<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Would you target your audience differently, knowing the real age and gender of the text authors on your website forum? This paper examines hundreds of thousands of online documents, e.g. chat lines or blog posts, showing that computers are capable to address this task better than humans, without relying on content stereotypes. Pointing out that age and gender profiling are not independent problems, we approach the task as a multiclass classification problem, combining the age and gender information to define six classes. Utilizing a wide range of stylistic and content features and a large number of readability measures we demonstrate the high predictive abilities of the parts of speech, the punctuation and the amount of emotions and slang used in the text, independently of the topic discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The author profiling task aims at revealing certain categorical information about the author, rather than reveal his/her exact identity. Such categories can be his/her age, his/her gender, but also the native country, degree of education or other socio-demographic information. Beside its obvious applications in marketing, author profiling can be beneficial also in the educational domain, e.g. in large scale screenings of pupils, where it can help to reveal the exceptional talents. It can also help to estimate the appropriate knowledge level of the audience in an educational forum.</p><p>The PAN challenge task targeted the prediction of age and gender of a document author. Training corpora were provided for the English and Spanish language. They consisted of XML documents containing blog posts or chat messages (HTML format) grouped into one document per author and labelled with his/her language, gender and age group. The final software had to be ran on an assigned virtual machine, having a single CPU with 4 GB of RAM.</p><p>This paper presents our classification approach and implemented features, after which we discuss our experimental results for age and gender separately and combined.</p><p>Studying gender differences and comparing them to social stereotypes has been a popular task in many psychological studies of 20th century <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.48,159.89,16.60,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.13,159.89,16.60,8.64" target="#b16">[17]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.79,159.89,15.27,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Traditional studies worked on small datasets, which often led to contradictory results (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,430.42,171.85,16.60,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref> v. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,458.18,171.85,14.94,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref>). The majority of the studies agree, that there are two main feature groups to distinguish gender -stylistic and content-based. The first detailed gender study in a larger scale was performed by Newman, Pennebaker et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.79,207.71,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref> on 14,324 samples from 70 different studies (conversation, exams, fiction etc.). According to them, women are more likely to include pronouns, verbs, negations, references to home, family, friends and to various emotions. Men tend to use longer words, more articles, prepositions and numbers. Men also swear more often and discuss current concerns (e.g. money, leisure or sports). Schler, Koppel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.25,267.49,16.60,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref> apply machine learning techniques to a corpus of 37,478 blogs from blogger.com. Using classes of content words from the LIWC Framework <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.67,291.40,16.60,8.64" target="#b23">[24]</ref> extended by blog slang (words and abbreviations such as LOL or OMG) and style-related features such as part-of-speech (POS) and function words, they were able to obtain an accuracy of 80% for gender and 76% for age, based on the Multi-Class Real Winnow classification algorithm. They found differences in topics which men and women discuss, as well as the increasing number of prepositions and determiners with age, together with the decreasing number of pronouns and negations. They report that the usage of hyperlinks increases with age. In another publication <ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.22,363.13,11.62,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref> they reach 72% accuracy for gender and 67% for age on the same corpus, using only stylistic features -POS tags, function words and contracted words without apostrophe (im, dont...). Koppel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,158.02,398.99,16.60,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also analyse gender differences based on 566 fiction and non-fiction documents from the British National Corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.98,410.95,10.58,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, using POS n-grams and function words. They reach an accuracy of 77%, however training on fiction and testing on non-fiction does not beat the 50% random baseline. Heylighen and Dewaele <ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.01,434.86,16.60,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref> introduce a contextuality measure based on the proportion of formal parts of speech (nouns, verbs...) to informal ones (adverbs, interjections...). Corney et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.63,458.77,11.62,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduce emotionally intense adjective and adverb endings, based on the assumption that women use more emotional words such as fabulous or awfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpus properties</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="2,160.49,547.90,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the distribution of documents in the corpus. Beside blogs and chats, snippets from authors who pretend to be minors have been included (e.g., documents composed of chat posts of sexual predators).</p><p>The online origin of the corpus brought new challenges into the task. First of all, the age and gender were given by the bloggers themselves. Hence e.g. a male teenage author surprises us by talking about the benefits of trade fairs: "...presently there have been far more trade fairs performed and media people will be certainly accessible at these locations so this enhances your expo to be observed by the people...". The second problem with the online data is the plagiarism. For example, the only post of one of the authors is a text about the city of Bhopal, an article which can be found on over hundred sites of various travel agencies <ref type="foot" coords="3,261.96,117.64,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The third problem relates to the spam in the data. In more than 20,000 English documents, words from the WordPress Codex spamlist<ref type="foot" coords="3,476.61,129.60,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">2</ref> constitute at least 0.1% of all document words -meaning that if any of these document texts appeared in the comments under a WordPress blog with an active spamlist, it would be quarantined for manual spam moderation by the blog administrator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Our Approach</head><p>We combine age and gender information to create six separate document classes and perform multiclass classification, using the one-against-all training approach. Certain stylistic features can be highly predictive both of gender and of age, which makes it necessary to determine both gender and age at the same time in the classification. For example smileys, as illustrated on Figures <ref type="figure" coords="3,310.11,278.36,11.53,8.64" target="#fig_0">1(a</ref>)-1(d). This correlation was previously observed also by Schler and Koppel <ref type="bibr" coords="3,280.36,290.31,10.58,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Our system builds upon the Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Software Repository (DKPro Core)<ref type="foot" coords="3,192.55,313.32,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_2">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,200.10,314.99,15.27,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, an open-source Natural Language Processing framework based on Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) <ref type="foot" coords="3,425.65,325.27,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . The system uses the DKPro Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.74,338.90,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> framework to combine NLP components into pipelines. We preprocess the data using the TreeTagger <ref type="bibr" coords="3,303.21,350.85,16.60,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for POS tagging and lemmatization for both languages. For English we additionally use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,374.76,10.58,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Having experimented with the SVM with the polynomial (1,2,3) and RBF kernel, and with the Updateable Naive Bayes classifier, we trained the final system using logistic regression with an unlimited number of iterations and with the ridge estimators <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,410.63,16.60,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref> in their default configuration in the Weka <ref type="bibr" coords="3,318.41,410.63,16.60,8.64" target="#b12">[13]</ref> machine learning framework. While SVM performed the best on a small training set (6,000 documents), the computational complexity of the training was growing too fast. Since the system should deal with unknown test sets, we preferred to sacrifice some performance for scalability.</p><p>To select the training subsets, we first eliminate the documents whose text consists of more than 0.1% spam words. From the remaining data, we randomly select 5000 documents for each age and gender combination, thus obtaining 30,000 training doc-  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiments</head><p>We compare our results to the majority class baseline -accuracy 0.5 for gender and 0.33 for each of the three age classes (0.17 combined). Although the provided data contained 41%, resp.57%, of authors over 30 years, our training sets have more equally distributed instances, as finding the outliers in author profiles is often more useful in practice.</p><p>To measure an approximative human performance on the corpus, we conducted a user study. Twenty randomly selected English documents, containing about 500 words each, were evaluated by 15 participants. We measured the accuracy based on the majority vote. The confusion matrix is displayed in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,357.52,560.60,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Human participants reached an overall accuracy of 25% (50% on determining gender and 55% on determining age), while simple majority class baseline would result in 55% accuracy on gender and 50% on age. They assigned majority of the texts to authors in their 30's. This could possibly suggest that teenage authors may copy their blog content from other sources, or that they do not give correct age information about themselves.</p><p>We divide the features to five classes described below. We use the Information Gain feature selection approach <ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.12,644.48,16.60,8.64" target="#b28">[29]</ref> to rank and prune the feature space, using the top 1500 features.</p><p>Surface features To capture the surface properties of text, we measure the length of documents, sentences and words and their proportions to each other. We also count the ratio of words longer than five letters and words shorter than three letters compared to all words, and we count the occurrence of web links and smileys. Several further features are extracted using regular expressions, such as words with repetitive letters (e.g. cooool, wooow), words with numbers (e.g.w8, ton8) and number patterns such as phone numbers.</p><p>Syntactic features and punctuation Syntactic features constitute the majority of all features, as they proved helpful in previous work and at the same time are conveniently robust to be used across corpora and languages. We extract POS unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and quadrigrams as well as the ratio of each POS type separately. We implement the contextuality measure <ref type="bibr" coords="5,243.83,272.54,129.41,8.64">(Heylighen and Deweale, 2002)</ref>, comparing impliciteness and expliciteness of the text based on POS tags used: F = (noun frequency + adjective freq. + preposition freq. + article freq. -pronoun freq. -verb freq. -adverb freq. -0 interjection freq. + 100) * 0.5 . We measure the proportion of singular and plural nouns, proper nouns and pronouns (both together and separately), as well as the ratio of personal pronouns for each grammatical form separately (I, me v. he, him...). From measuring the ratios of comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs, and question mark and exclamation mark patterns, we expect clearer distinction of the teenage style. We retrieve the proportions of inner punctuations, end punctuations and commas, as labelled by the POS tagger. We further extract the proportion of modal verbs, which we granulate in English on modals expressing certainty (shall, will...) and uncertainty (could, may..). We also measure the ratio of future and past verb tenses. Some of the features have not been adapted to Spanish due to the different POS tagset used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Readability measures</head><p>We implemented the most prominent readability measures, such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level <ref type="bibr" coords="5,274.48,473.58,15.27,8.64" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the Automatic Readability Index <ref type="bibr" coords="5,428.03,473.58,15.27,8.64" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the LIX Index <ref type="bibr" coords="5,159.37,485.54,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the Coleman-Liau Index <ref type="bibr" coords="5,274.05,485.54,11.62,8.64" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the Flesch Reading Ease <ref type="bibr" coords="5,402.71,485.54,10.58,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The majority of those is computed using the average word and sentence lengths and number of syllables per sentence, combined with manually determined weights. The SMOG grade <ref type="bibr" coords="5,447.19,509.45,16.60,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and the Gunning-Fog Index <ref type="bibr" coords="5,234.07,521.41,16.60,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref> also consider the number of complex words defined as words with three or more syllables. We did not adapt these readability measures to the Spanish corpus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic features</head><p>We experimented with retrieving the most frequent semantic triples, which are popular mainly in question answering tasks. A semantic sentence triple consists of a discourse entity, a semantic relation and a governing word to which the entity relates, e.g. i-want-you, you-think-this. We suspected men to refer more to actions (you-should-X) and women to feelings (i-love-X). However, the rank of these features decreased with the dataset growth, such as word n-grams did. We performed WordNet lookup using Java WordNet Library<ref type="foot" coords="6,282.30,189.37,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_4">5</ref> to extract the number of senses for nouns and verbs in the text. Unfortunately, we had to exclude these semantic features from the final configuration in favour of processing time on the given machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content features, lexical features and stopwords</head><p>We use word unigrams and bigrams and stopword unigrams and bigrams based on the Snowball stopword list <ref type="foot" coords="6,425.42,246.27,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . The Named Entity Features capture the number of named entities in the article, using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer, in particular the 3-class model with distributional similarity features for tagging all entities of the types Person, Organization and Location. We use both the overall named entity counts and the average number of named entities per sentence as features. We also composed 23 word lists inspired by web resources 78 and previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="6,214.95,319.67,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref> -their full overview can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,417.48,319.67,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. As our main goal was to create a robust, dataset independent system, we focused mainly on lists expressing various emotions (anger, fear...) or language styles (teenage neologisms, web slang words, swear words...) rather than discussion topic areas.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>By the time of writing this paper, the challenge results are not yet finalized. We randomly split our selected training sets to 80% training and 20% test data for the evaluation. Performance of our systems was compared to the majority class baseline. Results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,212.29,607.66,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_5">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Gender profiling</head><p>When trained only for gender profiling, our system reaches an accuracy of 0.58 on English and 0.65 on Spanish dataset. As we observed much noise in the English corpus, we tested our system also on the English corpus from Mukherjee et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,436.78,161.71,16.60,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref> (3227 authors), on which we reach an accuracy of 0.65, comparable to previous experiments with similar classification setup <ref type="bibr" coords="7,263.17,185.62,15.27,8.64" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Features that appeared in the 50 best performing ones in at least two datasets are listed in table <ref type="table" coords="7,190.19,209.53,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. Men tend to use more articles, longer words and articles, in accordance with <ref type="bibr" coords="7,156.04,221.49,15.27,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and talk more about computers. Women are likely to use more emotional words, smileys and exclamations. They are also more likely to talk about love. Longer word ngrams have no impact in any of the datasets. In the English dataset we observed also higher usage of hyperlinks by men, as previously noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,387.46,257.36,15.27,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and highly ranked readability measures which are based on word length (ARI, LIX). However it is not the case for readability measures based on number of syllables <ref type="bibr" coords="7,386.74,281.27,88.70,8.64">(Flesch, SMOG, FOG)</ref>. Hence the usage of hyperlinks and long words may only suggest, that long words could be names of specific websites and male blogs in our corpus are simply more likely to contain spam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Age profiling</head><p>Training our system for age profiling only, we reach an accuracy of 0.53 on the English and 0.57 on the Spanish dataset.</p><p>Top ranked features shared by both datasets are listed in table <ref type="table" coords="7,399.63,387.99,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_6">6</ref>. The older authors tend to write longer posts using longer words. They pay more attention to commas, although their sentences are not necessarily longer. Younger authors also use more pronouns and less nouns and articles -similar features distinguish male and female authors, as pointed out also by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,255.72,435.81,10.58,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The highest ranked features in the Spanish dataset were the smileys, commas, and different writing of words using the letter q, instead of which teenagers use k, such as ke, kiero. Adults also talk more about work and god. On the English dataset, we observed a higher usage of hyperlinks by older authors, lower readability and more frequent punctuation. Topic word lists played an important roleyounger people use more emotional words, neologisms and slang, talk more about other people (classmates, parents...) and about computers.</p><p>The English dataset suffered from different errors than the Spanish one. While the major issue in the Spanish dataset was distinguishing teenage authors from 20's , in case of English dataset it was to distinguish teenagers from mature authors (30's). If we assume that all authors reported their correct age, this might be caused by the plagiarism and by the fact that the corpus contained also chat conversations of sexual predators from PAN 2012 <ref type="foot" coords="7,200.54,577.60,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_8">9</ref> , which we did not particularly address.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Final system</head><p>We reach an overall accuracy of 0.29 on the English dataset and 0.38 on the Spanish one, with the majority baseline being 0.17. English and Spanish confusion matrices for the final system are displayed in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,310.60,239.57,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. For the English corpus, we achieve the best recall for 20's men (43%) and the lowest for teenage men (25%), who are often misclassified as 30's women (21%). In Spanish we obtain the best recall for 30's men (46%) and the worst also for teenage men (31%), but these are often misclassified as 20's men(24%). The feature ranking in the final system is listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,424.03,287.39,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. The highest ranked feature is the number of hyperlinks for English and the number of smileys for Spanish, and in both cases the ratio of words longer than 5 letters and the features. Surface features are ranked surprisingly high as well, followed by readability measures. While in English the ratio of individual part-of-speech tags plays an important role, in Spanish POS trigrams and quadrigrams are preferred. From the vocabulary lists, teenage words, emotion words and work words (see Table <ref type="table" coords="9,395.59,359.12,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_3">3</ref> are the most dominant, followed by the expressions of positive feelings and uncertainty. From all the word n-grams, only the unigrams love and ur were selected for the English corpus and the unigrams distinguishing letters, such as k, q, ke, que, for the Spanish corpus. We compare the performance of the classifiers trained on each feature class separately and all of them together. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,381.84,420.93,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. Neither of the datasets is sufficiently separable by surface features alone, reaching the accuracy of 0.20, resp. 0.21 only.</p><p>Syntactic features performed well on the Spanish dataset. Errors occured mainly for teenagers being incorrectly classified as 20's men (18%), some 20's men classified as 30's women (21%), and some 30's women classified as 30's men (25%) and vice versa (20%). On the English dataset syntactic features show lower accuracy. Many women in their 20's were classified as 20's men (22%), some 30's men were misclassified as one decade younger (18%), and both genders of teenagers were in 20% of the cases incorrectly classified as adult women in their 30's, potentially due to plagiarism.</p><p>Content features alone were the best performing of all individual feature classes. They were suitable to distinguish age groups, but had problem with recognizing gender -on Spanish dataset 21% of 20's women classified as 20's men and vice versa, 29% of 30's women as 30's men and 23% of 30's men as 30's women. The English dataset suffered from similar errors as with syntactic features. Teenage slang and emotion words were the most helpful word lists, hence removing the topic bias (work words, family words etc. did not impact the performance.</p><p>To our knowledge, our system was the first to approach the age and gender problem as a single multiclass classification problem, which helped us to observe both tasks in context and confirm, that the age and gender profiling are not independent problems. We have shown that both of them can be determined by the same features (young men are more emotional than older ones, and so are women, which is visible through stylistic features). We were the first to employ readability measures in this task and we show, that these are ranked high in both age and gender classification. This is in accordance with the high ranks of words longer than five letters, which are used more by men and mature authors. While we observe, with regards to syntactic and content features, similar findings to previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="10,255.19,249.21,16.60,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref> [26] <ref type="bibr" coords="10,293.53,249.21,11.62,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref> [1] mainly on the Spanish corpus, syntactic features were not dominant on the English corpus, probably due to strong noise potentially caused by the presence of spammers, plagiators and sexual predators. When we run our system on a cleaner English corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="10,312.20,285.08,15.27,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we drew similar conclusions to state of the art literature. We have demonstrated that humans perform worse than computers in this task (close to random), as they cannot capture patterns in the data well and rely on content stereotypes. While content features perform overall better than syntactic features, the accuracy of the latter is satisfactory and can be easier adapted for a multilingual system, while e.g. translation of teenage slang is challenging without very good knowledge of the target language.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,209.02,378.36,197.32,8.12;4,141.78,242.12,162.53,107.41"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
