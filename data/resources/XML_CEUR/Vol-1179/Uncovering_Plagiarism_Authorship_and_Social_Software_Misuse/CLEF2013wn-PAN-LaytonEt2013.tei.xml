<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our approach to the author identification task uses existing authorship attribution methods using local n-grams (LNG) and performs a weighted ensemble. This approach came in third for this year's competition, using a relatively simple scheme of weights by training set accuracy. LNG models create profiles, consisting of a list of character n-grams that best represent a particular author's writing. The use of a weighted ensemble improved upon the accuracy of the method without reducing the speed of the algorithm; the submitted solution was not only near the top of the leaderboard in terms of accuracy, but it was also one of the faster algorithms submitted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The authorship identification task at PAN 2013 was a variation on a standard authorship analysis task of authorship attribution. In authorship identification, we have a training set of documents from the same author and a test document of unknown authorship. The task is to determine whether the author of the training documents was the one that wrote the test document. This task is different from authorship attribution in a few ways. First, we cannot simply take a 'best guess' whereby we find the best matching author. A decision on match or no match must be made, similar to the open set problem of authorship attribution, whereby the actual author may not be in the candidate set. Second, we have no point of reference to compare the similarity of author to document. In other words, we cannot know relatively if two profiles are similar and must therefore find algorithms that are able to know absolutely if two profiles match. Third, specifically for this task, the number of documents was small. Most problems in this task had just three documents from the same author, reducing the ability to determine variance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Local n-grams</head><p>Local n-gram models were first proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="1,314.81,584.71,11.62,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in 2003, who introduced the Common n-grams algorithm (CNG). CNG was developed for authorship attribution, working by profiling authors and documents based on the list of the top L character n-grams. Character n-grams had been used in authorship studies prior, but previous methods used a 'global' set of n-grams. CNG instead used 'local' profiles, whereby an author's (or document's) profile consists only of the most frequent character n-grams for that author (or document).</p><p>Authorship attribution for a test document is performed by comparing the profile for the document with the profiles of each of the candidate authors using equation 1 ( where P i (x) is the frequency of n-gram x for a given profile). The most similar profile is considered the author of the test document.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,203.07,174.35,277.53,35.10">d K (P 1 , P 2 ) = x∈X P 1 ∪X P 2 2 • (P 1 (x) -P 2 (x)) P 1 (x) + P 2 (x) 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>[5] identified that a much simpler algorithm was capable of comparable results, called Source Code Author Profiling (SCAP). Rather than use the frequency of the most frequent n-grams, two profiles are compared simply by the size of the intersection of the n-grams in the profiles. While this does reduce the accuracy, the net result is often quite small and the algorithm is significantly faster. As an empirical result, our code for CNG performs a profile comparison in about three milliseconds, while for SCAP it is less than one millisecond (our testing framework does not give better precision).</p><p>Further variations were developed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,302.72,297.52,15.27,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, who focused on variations of CNG for unbalanced datasets. The first variation, d1 has a single subtle change, using only the n-grams in the test document for comparison. The second variation, d2 proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,463.99,321.43,16.60,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is to use a training corpus profile, called P C , which is composed of all the documents in the training set. The distance is given as the dot product of the d1 distance from the document to author and the d1 distance of the document to the language profile. These alterations to CNG proved to be more accurate than 'standard' CNG when there was a limited number of documents for an author. However when an adequate number of documents per author is reached, the results reverse and standard CNG, using equation 1, proves to be more accurate.</p><p>Another variation was developed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.97,417.07,16.60,8.64" target="#b12">[13]</ref> named Recentred Local Profiles (RLP). While the distance metric was different from CNG and SCAP, using a variation of the cosine distance metric, the main difference was the use of a language default value, similar to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.88,452.94,15.27,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Rather than profile using the most frequent n-grams for an author or document, the most distinctive n-grams are chosen. An n-gram is more distinctive than another if the absolute distance to the expected value for the language is higher. The expected value for an n-gram can be calculated from a corpus of text in the language, and has the benefit of being able to use unlabelled data. RLP was shown to have a high quality on many datasets, including the AAAC corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.55,512.71,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>LNG methods have been used for a significant number of tasks. Some successful applications include authorship of twitter posts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,313.16,536.62,15.27,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, student coding essays <ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.56,536.62,10.79,8.64" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,433.35,536.62,7.19,8.64" target="#b2">3]</ref>, software forensics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.10,548.58,10.58,8.64" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, internet relay chat logs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.60,548.58,15.27,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, malware profiling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.21,548.58,11.62,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and has been extended into automated unsupervised applications <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.77,560.53,15.27,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. LNG based approaches are highly applicable to any language, as the notion of a character is quite prolific. In cases where a character can be hard to define, often examining the bytes of a representation (such as unicode) can provide an adequate substitution <ref type="bibr" coords="2,320.00,596.40,10.58,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head><p>The LNG methods described in the literature are mostly developed for authorship attribution and not authorship identification. Intuitively, we created an algorithm that iden-tifies if the test document compares to the training set in the same way as documents in the training set compare to each other -i.e. if it looks like a training document, it was probably written by the same person. To convert the methods to an authorship identification task, we applied the following procedure.</p><p>1. Calculate the pairwise distance between all documents in the training set and call this distribution du. 2. Calculate the distance between the test document and each of the training documents, and call this distribution dt. 3. Compute the number of elements in dt that are less than the mean of du and call this p. 4. If p &lt; t for some t (set to 0.5 by default), then the test document is considered a match. Otherwise, it is not a match.</p><p>Formally, a 'problem' is defined as a set of documents from the same author (the training set) and a document of unknown authorship (the test document). The aim is to determine if the author of the training set wrote the test document.</p><p>The ensemble method was inspired by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.46,307.88,10.58,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which used a weighted voting model with local n-grams, including a 'reject' option, indicating if no match was found. In that work, a large number of CNG models were used with different parameters, and the weights were assigned based on the ratio r = 1-a b , where a is the distance between the test profile and the best matching author profile and b is the distance to the second best. Note that this application is valid for authorship attribution tasks, and not for authorship identification, as we only have one candidate author.</p><p>Instead, the method we used was to assign each model a weight according to its accuracy in the training set. Any model with a weight of less than 0.4 is reduced to 0. The reason for this is that in the author identification task, there are only two possible answers -match or no match. This gives a baseline accuracy of 0.5, assuming the test dataset contains equal numbers of problems of each type. We decided that models scoring under 0.4 were a hindrance rather than a help.</p><p>To summarise, out approach was to use a set of LNG models and ask each whether they thought the document was from the same author or not. This used the approach given in section 2. Each model's prediction was weighted according to their accuracy in the training set, with models scoring less than 0.4 given a weight of 0. The weights for both options (match or no match) were summed and the option with the highest weight was chosen as the final answer. The models included in the ensemble were the CNG, SCAP, RLP, d1 and d2 models. The parameters were n ∈ {3, 4, 5} and L = 1000 for each of the five models. We hypothesise that a larger number of models would have improved accuracy, but was not able to test this hypothesis for this competition.</p></div>
