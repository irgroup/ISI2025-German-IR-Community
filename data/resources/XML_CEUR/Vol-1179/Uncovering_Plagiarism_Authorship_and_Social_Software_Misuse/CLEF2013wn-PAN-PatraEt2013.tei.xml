<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In the 21 st century, popularity of the Internet is increasing abundantly. Internet media like emails, blogs/internet forum and websites have been identified as the ideal communication platform for the people. In the recent years, the researchers have been paid increasingly interest to analyze of authorship of emails, electronic messages <ref type="bibr" coords="1,458.82,578.08,11.88,9.05" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and plagiarism detection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,228.37,589.48,11.87,9.05" target="#b6">[7]</ref> etc. Thus, analyzing the web content has become more important to the intelligence and security agencies that monitor the author information as much as possible <ref type="bibr" coords="1,213.53,612.52,10.69,9.05" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The task of automatically predicting the authorship from anonymous text by extracting the linguistic and stylistic features has a number of potential applications <ref type="bibr" coords="1,214.73,635.56,10.69,9.05" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, if you have important textual information of an unknown author and want to know author"s gender, age, demographic and cultural background etc., just by analyzing the text.</p><p>In this paper, we present the task of automatic authorship identification from anonymous data provided by the PAN-2013. PAN-2013 is the 9th evaluation lab on uncovering plagiarism, authorship and social software misuse. Author Profiling task is concerned with predicting an author's demographics from her writing. Besides being personally identifiable, an author's style may also reveal her age and gender. We have used linguistic and stylistic feature for identifying the authors" age and gender. Different word lists have been created for calculating the frequencies of each document. We have also created the stopword list, smiley list, positive and negative word lists etc. for creating the feature vector. A machine learning algorithm has been employed for classifying the authors" profile. The Decision tree of Weka<ref type="foot" coords="2,431.02,229.77,3.00,5.45" target="#foot_0">1</ref> tool has been used for the classification task. The accuracy of the system has been calculated by the PAN organizers and we have achieved 56.83% and 28.95% for gender and age group classification.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 discusses briefly the related work available till date. Section 3 provides an overview of the data used in the experiments. Section 4 describes the feature selection for implementation of Machine learning algorithm and Section 5 gives the details of the system architecture. Section 6 presents the experiments with detail analysis of results. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future directions are presented in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Studies</head><p>Automatic author profiling is the task of predicting author"s traits automatically using any of the machine learning algorithms. It is more important to identify the authors" trait when any of that author"s documents does not belong to the training data. In contrast, we can say that the greater accuracy can be achieved when the author"s documents are present in the training data. Most of the research on author"s profiling focuses on the less number of traits. For example, in addition to gender, age and the native language, level of education and country of residence are also identified in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.96,467.89,10.66,9.05" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. But, in our present work, efforts have been given to identify only the age and gender.</p><p>A considerable amount of research on automatic classification of texts into predefined categories has already been conducted by different research groups using several machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="2,272.69,513.85,15.41,9.05" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

Houvardas and Stamatatos <ref type="bibr" coords="2,296.33,594.40,11.69,9.05" target="#b1">[2]</ref> showed that n-gram is the best feature for authors" profiling classification whereas Schler and his group <ref type="bibr" coords="2,392.59,605.92,11.69,9.05" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have shown the effect of age and gender in Blogging sites. The authors have considered different word classes and shown the relation of each word class with the authors" gender and age. Some works <ref type="bibr" coords="2,197.72,640.36,10.76,9.05" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.21,640.36,11.71,9.05" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have identified that the POS is also an admirable linguistic feature in this type of classification. Calix and his group <ref type="bibr" coords="3,359.10,149.48,16.72,9.05" target="#b9">[10]</ref> have used 55 different features and achieved the highest accuracy of 76.72%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Data</head><p>The data used in our experiments are provided by the PAN-2013. The corpus consists of XML documents containing the conversations in HTML format. Many different topics are grouped by author and labeled with his/her language, gender and age group. The documents are of two languages (English and Spanish), two genders (Male and Female), and three groups of age (10s: 13-17 yrs, 20s: 23-27 yrs and 30s: 33-47yrs). Basically, we have developed the system for English language only. Each of the authors is presented in a separate XML file, the name of which provides information about the language, gender and age group in order to facilitate file tasks, and grouped by language in two separate folders, EN and ES.</p><p>The English corpus incorporates a total of 236,000 authors (files) containing 413,564 conversations and 180,809,187 words. The detailed distribution of data is given in Table . 1. In our present task, a total of 1200 XML files are used for the development purpose and rest of the data is used for training whereas the test data is provided by the PAN organizers.  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,427.90,606.64,10.69,9.05" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. But, it has been observed that the features are proved not effective while trying to find out any similarity for the automatic identification process. Thus, we have incorporated the knowledge of word class frequencies. The features are as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age</head><p>Word class Frequency: The word class frequency feature plays an important role in author profiling as in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,223.19,664.12,10.66,9.05" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Each word class contains a set of stemmed words related to synonyms and hypernyms. We have manually created a small number of seed list for each of the classes.</p><p>Then, we have used the hypernym and synonym relations of RiTaWordNet 2 to increase the seed list. The increased word lists are checked manually. There are 9 classes, namely money, job, sports, television, sleep, eat, sex, family and friend. Each of the lists contains an average of 1400 unique words. The statistics of each class is given in the Table <ref type="table" coords="4,199.75,221.48,3.76,9.05" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Positive and Negative word class: It is found that the positive and negative word classes are also key features for automatic author profiling <ref type="bibr" coords="4,383.15,244.55,10.66,9.05" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Thus, these two classes contain the words which do not appear in our existing 9 word classes. After getting all possible POS from RiTaWordNet, the sentiment scores of the words have been calculated using the SentiWordNet 3:0 3 lexicon. Then, the words having sentiment score greater than 0.1 and less than -0.1 (threshold value: |0.1|) have been considered as the positive and negative sentiment word classes. The Positive and Negative word classes contain a total of 9627 and 10383 words respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Class</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stop words frequency:</head><p>Stop words have been found as one of the important features. We have observed that the age group 20 has used more number of stop words in their text. A total of 329 stop words have been prepared manually.</p><p>Smiley words list: Frequency of Smileys in each file has been calculated using the handcrafted Smiley List. We have listed 55 smileys prepared manually by us. After calculating the frequency of smileys in each of the files, smileys are replaced by full stop words.</p><p>List of Foreign Words (FW): These are the words, which are tagged as FW by the StanfordCoreNLP 4 POS tagger. These are basically meee, yesss, thy, u and urs etc.</p><p>List of Punctuations: 10 types of punctuations are prepared manually.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>List of Pronouns:</head><p>The frequencies of the pronouns are also computed. Pronouns are tagged as PRP by StafordCoreNLP POS tagger.</p><p>Average Length of Sentence: We have considered the average sentence length in documents. The sentence boundary is detected by the StanfordCoreNLP tool.</p><p>It has been found that the size of each document varies, i.e., some documents contain more number of words and some documents contain less words. So, we have normalized each bag of word feature by dividing the total number of words in a document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">System Architecture</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,154.18,295.31,29.98,9.05" target="#fig_0">1shows</ref> different processing modules and step by step flow of processing the documents. Initially, the XML documents have been cleaned. The cleaning process involves the removal of garbage words (e.g. '\ufffd' and "\u007f' etc.) and XML tags. Then, the frequency of smiley or emoticons has been calculated and the smileys have been replaced by full stop because it has been observed from the corpus data that smileys are generally occurred at the end of the sentence and sentence end marker i.e., full stop is not present for those sentences.</p><p>The Stanford CoreNLP package has been used to detect the sentence boundary and then, the average word in a sentence has been calculated from the sentence boundary detected text. Each word of the XML document has also been stemmed by the Stanford CoreNLP package. The punctuation list has been used to calculate frequencies from the text.</p><p>The Stanford CoreNLP POS tagger has been used to tag parts of speech (POS) of each word. Pronouns and Foreign words frequencies have been calculated from the tagged text. Pronouns and Foreign Words are tagged as PRP and FW by the Stanford CoreNLP POS tagger.</p><p>Word class frequencies have also been calculated by using the manually prepared lists. The Positive and Negative word frequencies have also been determined by using the RiTaWordNet. The stop word frequency has been determined by using stop words list. The frequencies of word class, positive word, negative words, pronoun, punctuation and foreign words have been normalized by dividing the total number of words present in the document. The extracted features are also used to prepare our test templates.</p><p>We have used the API of Weka 3.7.7.5 to accomplish our classification experiments. Weka is an open source data mining tool. It presents a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. We employed the Decision tree (J48) for classifying the documents. The decision tree model has been trained by training template and the model has been used to classify the test template. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments and Results</head><p>The detailed results of the PAN author profiling task have been shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,462.78,561.40,3.76,9.05" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The result of our system has been evaluated by the PAN organizers. Though the result shows that the overall performance of our approach (patra13) is below the base line, but if we consider the accuracy of Gender identification, our approach is in the second best position in the results. Our gender identification accuracy achieved 0.5683 compared to the best score of 0.5690. But, our approach does not perform well to classify age and achieved accuracy of 28.95%. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we have presented the task of automatic classifying the author"s gender and age from their writing. This work is of interest for a number of potential applications like forensics, security and marketing etc. We have performed our experiment on the 23600 training data provided by the PAN-2013 organizers. The results provided in this work were calculated by PAN organizers. We have acquired the accuracies of 56.83% and 28.95% in gender and age classifications respectively.</p><p>In our future work, the accuracy of the classification can be improved by finding and incorporating more suitable features like POS, number of Ellipsis, average word length and number of paragraphs etc. It would also be interesting to perform deeper features engineering for finding demographic and psychometric author traits more correctly. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,237.29,484.57,120.64,9.05"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: System architecture</figDesc></figure>
