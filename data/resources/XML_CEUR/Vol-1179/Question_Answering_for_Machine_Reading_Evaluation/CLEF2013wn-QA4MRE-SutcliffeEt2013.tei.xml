<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The QA4MRE Lab focuses on the reading of single documents and the identification of the correct answers to a set of questions. Questions are in the form of multiple choices, each having five options, and only one correct answer. The detection of correct answers might require eventually various kinds of inference and the consideration of previously acquired background knowledge from reference document collections. Although the additional knowledge obtained through the background collection may be used to assist with answering the questions, the principal answer is to be found among the facts contained in the test documents given. Thus, reading comprehension tests do not require only semantic understanding but they assume a cognitive process which involves using implications and presuppositions, retrieving the stored information, performing inferences to make implicit information explicit. Many different forms of knowledge take part in this process: linguistic, procedural, world-and-common-sense knowledge. All these forms coalesce in the memory of the reader and it is sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish and reconstruct them in a system which needs additional knowledge and inference rules in order to understand the text and to give sensitive answers. Reading Comprehension tests are routinely used to assess the degree to which people comprehend what they read, so we work with the hypothesis that it is reasonable to use these tests to assess the degree to which a machine "comprehends" what it is reading.</p><p>To assess the degree and types of understanding, we have the system answer questions about a given text. While the desired answer is usually also present in the test document (albeit perhaps in some non-obvious form), it may not be, or the reader may require additional background information to know what to search for, such as explicit and implicit references to entities, events, dates, places, situations, etc. pertaining to the topic.</p><p>In general, more prior background knowledge makes understanding and question answering easier. Computational resources such as wordnets, framenets, paraphrase lists, knowledge bases, etc., are aimed at making different kinds of prior knowledge available for the machine. In QA4MRE we add to these resources the possibility to acquire background knowledge from a large collection of related documents. The advantage is the opportunity to gather probability distributions linked to knowledge, and to explore distributional approaches to QA. We discuss background knowledge in Section 3.</p><p>The evaluation questions should be answerable by most humans without the need to explore a specific document of the background collection. Examples of inferences we allow are: 3. Inferences considering causal relations or procedural steps in "life scripts" like visiting a restaurant or attending a concert; 4. Inferences that require composing several answers, in particular answering one part of the question using the background collection and then, with its answer, answering the other part of the initial question (e.g., "Who is the wife of the person who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992?").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">TASK DESCRIPTION</head><p>In 2013, we had three exercises.</p><p>1. Main Task. This remained the same for participants. Background collections, test documents and reading tests were available in Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Romanian, and Spanish. There were four topics: AIDS, Alzheimer's Disease, Climate Change and Music and Society. As was the case last year, there is also a pilot task on Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>The difference is that the reference collection for the main task is built from general public sources and for the pilot the source is the PubMed repository. Following the pilot task last year on Processing Modality and Negation, these aspects were incorporated into questions within the main task.</p><p>2. Machine Reading on Biomedical Texts about Alzheimer's disease. This exercise is aimed at setting questions in the Biomedical domain with a special focus on one disease, namely Alzheimer's. This pilot task explored the ability of a system to answer questions using scientific language. Texts were taken from PubMed Central related to Alzheimer's and from 66,222 Medline abstracts. In order to keep the task reasonably simple for systems, participants were given the background collection already processed with Tok, Lem, POS, NER, and dependency parsing.</p><p>3. Entrance Exams. University Entrance Exams include questions formulated at various levels of complexity and test a wide range of capabilities. The challenge of "Entrance Exams" aims at evaluating systems under the same conditions humans are evaluated to enter the University. In this first campaign we will reduce the challenge to Reading Comprehension exercises contained in the English exams. More types of exercises will be included in subsequent campaigns <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.77,388.80,23.50,9.02">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,141.26,388.80,4.70,9.02">(2015)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,145.96,388.80,23.50,9.02">(2016)</ref> in coordination with the "Entrance Exams" task at NTCIR. Exams are created by the Japanese National Center for University Admissions Tests. The "Entrance Exams" corpus is provided by NII's Todai Robot Project and NTCIR.</p><p>In this paper we describe the Main task. The two other tasks are described in detail in dedicated papers in these proceedings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Main Task</head><p>Tests were divided into: -4 topics, namely "Aids", "Alzheimer", "Climate change" and "Music and Society"; -Each topic had four reading tests; -Each reading test consisted of one single document, with 15 Main questions (six having no answer in the text) and a set of five choices per question. The last of the five choices was always "None of the above". In addition, one or more Auxiliary questions could be asked, each of which was a simplification of a Main question (see discussion later).</p><p>Overall, the following evaluation setting was proposed:</p><p>-16 test documents (4 documents for each of the four topics), -240 Main questions (15 questions for each document), -1200 choices/options (5 for each question).</p><p>Test documents and questions were made available in Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Romanian and Spanish. These materials were exactly the same in all languages, created using parallel translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.2</head><p>What's new this year?</p><p>We introduced two novelties this year: (i) auxiliary questions to evaluate systems level of inference, and (ii) a portion of questions where none of the options were correct.</p><p>With respect to auxiliary questions, they correspond to Main questions where a deliberate simplification is done by removing one inference step. The idea was that if a system answered a Main question incorrectly but the corresponding Auxiliary question correctly, it suggests that the system was near to answering the question but could not perform the inference step. In a similar way, if a system answers the main question but not the simplified one, this indicates a lack in the inference process. Hence this approach could be used to pinpoint the exact shortcomings of a system. With respect to questions without correct answers among candidates, the idea is to test the ability to reject candidate answers when they are incorrect. We implemented this change by introducing in our tests a portion of questions where none of the options are correct and including a new last option in all questions: "None of the answers above is correct".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE BACKGROUND COLLECTIONS</head><p>This is a very important element of the evaluation setting. It connects the task also with the research in Information Retrieval. The goal of reference/background collections is to contextualize the reading of a single document related to the topic by collecting and fleshing out additional pertinent information. In the future this step may be done on the fly as a retrieval process once a single test text is provided. However, for now, we provide a carefully constructed background corpus for two main reasons: to allow more comparison among participant systems, and to focus on the Reading Comprehension problem. We believe it is important to develop a good methodology for building background collections for the evaluation task.</p><p>We define background knowledge in terms of the relation between the testing questions and answers, and the background collection. To determine the potential kinds of uses of the prior knowledge, we distinguish at least four main types of background knowledge (although in fact it's a continuum):</p><p>1. Very specific facts related to the document under study. For example, the relevant relation between two concrete people involved in a specific event. 2. General facts not specific to any particular event. For example, geographical knowledge, main players in international affairs, movie stars, world wars, etc. Also acronyms, transformations between quantities and measures, etc. 3. General abstractions that humans use to interpret language, to generate hypotheses or to fill missing or implicit information. For example, abstractions such as the result of observing the same event with different players (e.g. petroleum companies drill wells, quarterbacks throw passes, etc.) 4. Linguistic knowledge. For example, synonyms, hypernyms, transformations such as active/passive or nominalizations. Also transformations from words to numbers, meronymy, and metonymy. Obviously this is not an exhaustive list. For example, we do not include ontological relations that enable temporal and spatial reasoning, or reasoning on quantities, which are also all relevant.</p><p>Ideally, the background collection should cover completely the corresponding topic. This is feasible sometimes and unrealistic at others. For example, in the case of the pilot on Biomedical documents about Alzheimer's disease, a set of experts built a query (a set of conjunctions and disjunctions over 18 terms) that approximates very much the retrieval of all relevant documents (more than 66,000) without introducing much noise. However, this is not so easy in more open domains (e.g., Climate Change) or cases with non-specialized sources of information. In these cases, we crawl the web using, for each language and topic a list of keywords and a list of sources. Keywords are translated into English and then translated into the rest of the languages. Documents may be crawled from a variety of sources: newspapers, blogs, Wikipedia, journals, magazines, etc. The web sources are obviously language dependent, and each language also requires a list of possible web sites with documents related to the topic.</p><p>We realized in 2011, since we organizers knew the test set, we used that information to select the keywords, and ensure the coverage of the questions. The effect is not only that background collections don't cover completely the topic, but also that the collections have some bias with respect to the real distribution of concepts. In this year's campaign, the assumption that the ideal background collection should include all relevant documents for the topic (and only them) is explicit, and we organizers bear it in mind. Thus, we face the same problem as traditional Information Retrieval: we want all relevant documents (and only them), and we use queries (keywords) to retrieve them The first strategy with the aim of ensuring the coverage of the topic as much as possible is to make the topic specific enough (e.g., AIDS medicaments rather than AIDS). The second strategy is to try to cover (at least partially) each of the possible "dimensions/aspects" of that topic. How? First, by detecting a good central overview text, such as a Wikipedia article that "defines" the topic, "suggests" its principal aspects, and provides links to additional good material. Then, organizers enumerate these dimensions and prepare a set of queries for each dimension. They document this process with three benefits: (i) to know what organizers and participants can expect or not from the collection; (ii) to give another dimension of re-usability; and (iii) to explore how Machine Reading will connect to Information Retrieval in the future.   Table <ref type="table" coords="4,91.10,402.30,5.01,9.02" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the keywords used for each topic. They are a sort of more concrete definition of each topic, giving an idea of the subtopics covered by the collection. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TEST SET PREPARATION</head><p>This year the datasets was created for the following five languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Romanian and Spanish. The dataset was created following the methodology developed in previous years and consisting of the following steps:</p><p>1. Four English documents were selected for each of the four topics (Aids, Alzheimer's, Climate Change, Music and Society). These were selected from various sources (see Table <ref type="table" coords="5,362.12,304.02,4.16,9.02" target="#tab_4">4</ref>) and comprised the test documents against which questions were asked. The documents for the first three topics were chosen from copyright-free sources.</p><p>The documents for Music and Society were selected from Grove Music Online (http;//www.oxfordmusiconline.com) by kind permission of the Editor in Chief, Editor and Oxford University Press. This source was chosen because of its exceptional scholarly quality, as well as the very large choice of articles available on music of all kinds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>In order to have a set of identical questions for the five languages above, we needed to have the selected test documents translated. For this purpose, expert translators were recruited form the Translation for Progress<ref type="foot" coords="5,538.08,394.45,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_0">1</ref> platform for all languages.</p><p>3. To ensure that translations were faithful to the original document in both meaning and style and of good quality, all the documents were manually checked and corrected when necessary. We wanted to avoid a situation where portions of the original English text were left out of the translation in a particular target language, or perhaps modified or interpreted in a particular manner which would have made the question impossible to answer in that language.</p><p>4. Fifteen multiple-choice questions were then devised for each test document (the 'Main' questions). A question always had five candidate answers from which to choose, with one clearly correct answer and four clearly incorrect answers. In all cases the fifth candidate answer was "None of the above". Six of the fifteen questions were composed so as to have no answer in the text. The correct response to each of these six questions was thus "None of the above".</p><p>5. In addition to the fifteen Main questions, one or more Auxiliary questions could also be devised. Each Auxiliary question was a simplified version of an existing Main question. The format of these questions was identical to that of Main questions, i.e. a question followed by five multiple-choice answers. In most cases, the Auxiliary question required less inference to answer. The idea was that if a system was able to answer the Auxiliary question but not the corresponding Main question, the problem could be its ability to perform the missing inference. This is discussed more below.</p><p>6. Once the questions had been composed in the language of the original author, each was then translated into English. The English versions of the questions and candidate answers were carefully checked by a referee to verify that they were clear, that the intended answer was clearly correct, that the intended answer was in the test document, and that the other candidate answers were clearly incorrect. Questions were modified accordingly.</p><p>7. The English versions were then used to translate each question into each of the five languages of the task. The same process was used to translate each candidate answer (five per query) into the five languages.</p><p>8. The result of this process was a set of 240 Main questions and 44 Auxiliary questions in five languages, each with five multiple-choice answers, also in those five languages. The final step was to check that the answer to each question was in fact present in the test document for all the languages of the task. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Questions</head><p>For each text in the test set 10 multiple choice questions were created. Each question had five answer options. The fifth option was always 'None of the above'. The questions covered five different question types: purpose, method, causal, factoid, and which-is-true. Factoid questions were divided into the following sub-types: Location, Number, Person, List, Time and Unknown. Examples of the basic question types are given below. We took care to spread the question types evenly for a given test document, aiming for two questions per type. The exact breakdown of the number of questions per type in the test collection is provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,306.22,482.88,5.01,9.02" target="#tab_5">5</ref> below. Example questions: PURPOSE: What is the aim of protecting protein deposits in the brain? METHOD: How can the impact of Arctic drillings be reduced? CAUSAL: Name one reason why electronic dance music owes a debt to Kraftwerk. FACTOID (number): What is the approximate number of TB patients? WHICH-IS-TRUE: Which problem is similar in nature to global warming? For all questions, the direct answer was contained in the test document; however answering the questions typically required some background knowledge and some form of inference. The required knowledge could be linguistic or could involve basic world knowledge. Linguistic knowledge concerns, for example, the ability to perform co-reference resolution or detect paraphrases on the lexical or syntactic level. World knowledge has to be inferred from the background collection. For instance, the text might mention Barack Obama while the question might refer to the first African American President. The fact that Barack Obama is the first African American President needs to be learnt from the background collection in order to be able to answer the question.</p><p>Typical types of world knowledge involve, for instance, knowledge about the basic referents in a text, e.g., being aware that Yucca Mountain is in Nevada. Another type of world knowledge involves knowledge of "life scripts" such as "visiting a restaurant". Finally, the inference required can also be complex, involving several steps. For example, answering a question might require combining knowledge from the background collection with knowledge from the test document itself. For instance, the question "Who is the wife of the person who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992?" contains two facts P and Q, where P="wife of Y=?" and Q="winner of Nobel Peace Prize in 1992=Y". The latter information can be gleaned from the background collection whereas the former is contained within the test document itself.</p><p>For each test document, we aimed for a combination of simple, medium, and difficult questions. At most six questions per document did not require knowledge from the background collection. Two of these were simple questions, i.e., the answer and the fact questioned could be found in the same sentence in the test document. Four questions were of intermediate difficulty in that the answer and the fact questioned were not in the same sentence and could, in fact, be several sentences apart. Finally, the remaining four questions did require utilizing information from the background collection. While not all question types require inference based on the background collection, all of them required some form of textual and linguistic knowledge, such as the ability to detect paraphrases, as we made an effort to re-formulate questions in such a way that the answers could not be found by simple word overlap detection. For each question, we kept track of the inference required to answer it. This made it easier to ensure that that inference could in fact be drawn on the basis of the background collection, i.e., that the background collection did indeed contain the relevant fact. It also makes it possible to carry out further analyses regarding which questions or types of questions were difficult for the systems and why.</p><p>When creating the questions, we took care not to introduce any artificial patterns that would help finding the correct answer. Thus we ensured that all answer choices for a question were approximately the same length and consistent with respect to formulation and content, that all of the wrong answers were plausible, and that the placement of the correct answers was random and balanced.</p><p>Table 6 below shows a classification of the questions according to how much and what type of background knowledge they required. The table also provides the average c@1 obtained for each type of question. It can be seen that, unsurprisingly, the types of questions that require little knowledge and inference are generally answered more successfully. Questions requiring inference are by far the hardest, while it does not seem to make much difference whether the knowledge required is found within the test document or in the background collection. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Auxiliary Questions</head><p>In the first two years of the QA4MRE task, questions required a deep understanding of the text. However, since they were multiple-choice, the answer was simply judged as correct or incorrect. In the case of a correct question, it was impossible to judge whether the answer had been chosen at random or derived from a valid process of deduction. Similarly, if the answer was incorrect, it was impossible to judge why. To address this latter issue, an experiment was conducted this year in which Auxiliary questions were posed in addition to Main questions. Each Auxiliary question corresponded to a Main question and was a deliberate simplification of it which removed one inference step. The idea was that if a system answered a Main question incorrectly but the corresponding Auxiliary question correctly, it suggests that the system was near to answering the question but could not perform the inference step. Hence this approach could be used to pinpoint the exact shortcomings of a system.</p><p>In the main, three forms of simplification were used, hypernym replacement, noun phrase synonymy, and verbal entailment. Moreover, simplification could be made to the question or to the correct answer. Here are some examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypernym Replacement</head><p>In this example, the simplification is made to the question: Q (main Here, the hypernym "President of the United States" has been replaced by its hyponym "Obama" in the Auxiliary question. The supporting text refers to Obama and not President of the United States. Thus in order to answer the Main question, a system must infer that Obama is the President. This inference is not needed for the corresponding Auxiliary question since Obama is actually mentioned in both the question and the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noun Phrase Synonymy</head><p>Q: What sort of music was written for Hollywood films in the Golden Age? Supporting text:</p><p>The conventions of the "classical" Hollywood film score in the Golden Age -essentially a leitmotifbased symphonic romanticism with narrative orientation, the music almost always subordinated to the primacy of the visual image and dialogue -prevailed in scores by other expatriate musicians.</p><p>Here, the simplification is made to the answer, while the wording of the Main question and Auxiliary question remains the same:</p><p>A (main): music for orchestra with strong melodies A (aux): music embodying leitmotif-based symphonic romanticism</p><p>The Main question can only be answered by deducing that "music for orchestra with strong melodies" is largely synonymous with "leitmotif-based symphonic romanticism"; i.e., "symphonic" implies that the music is for full orchestra while "leitmotif-based" implies the use of strong easily-recognised melodies, associated with ideas or characters in the film.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Verbal Entailment</head><p>Q: What was Cramer's attitude towards the music of Bach? Supporting text (with added italics):</p><p>He may have been introduced to Das wohltemperirte Clavier as early as 1787, and he developed a lifelong fascination for Bach.</p><p>Again, the simplification is made to the answer: A (main): he admired Bach all his life A (aux): he developed a lifelong fascination for Bach Here, the Main question can only be answered by deducing that "he admired Bach all his life" is entailed by the supporting text "he developed a lifelong fascination for Bach". In the Auxiliary question, the answer is a substring of the supporting text, so no entailment is needed.</p><p>In all, 44 Auxiliary questions were composed, seventeen containing a simplification of the question and 27 containing a simplification of the correct answer. Analysis of the results concerning these questions can be found in Section 6.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EVALUATION</head><p>This task has the aim of promoting a change in QA architectures giving more importance to the validation step over the IR component in order to improve results. This is why we have been proposing from 2009 to evaluate system confidence by introducing the possibility of leaving questions unanswered <ref type="bibr" coords="10,354.52,275.88,10.64,9.02" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Thus, systems might reduce the amount of incorrect answers while keeping the proportion of correct ones.</p><p>However, the analysis of last editions has shown how systems rely more on ranking than in validation of candidate answers. These systems calculate the similarity of each candidate answer with a combination of the question and certain snippets of the document and return the most similar answer. Hence, systems have not shown nor developed their ability discarding incorrect answers. Besides, it is not clear the behavior in case of not providing the candidate answers. This is why we introduce in this edition an explicit assessment focus on testing the ability to reject candidate answers when they are incorrect. We implemented this change by introducing in our tests a portion of questions where none of the options are correct and including a new last option in all questions: "None of the answers above is correct". This modification does not affect the output of participants since given a question with its corresponding candidate answers, a participant system can return two kinds of responses:  An answer selected from the set of candidate ones for that question, taking into account that one candidate is "None of the answers above is correct"  A NoA answer. This response should be given if the system considers it is not able to find enough evidences about the correctness of candidate answers and it prefers not to answer the question instead of giving an incorrect answer. Moreover, the system can return as a hypothetical answer the candidate one that it would have been selected, which allows to give some feedback about its validation performance.</p><p>The assessments of system's responses are given automatically by comparing them against the gold standard collection. Therefore, no manual assessment was required, which reduces the effort of the evaluation once the collections have been created and makes easier the future development of systems. Each system's response to a question receives one and only one of the following three possible assessments:</p><p> Right if the system has selected the correct answer among the set of candidate ones of the given question;  Wrong if the system has selected one of the wrong answers;  NoA if the system has decided not to answer the question. Where the system returned a hypothetical answer, this answer was assessed as NoA_R in the case of it being correct or NoA_W if it was wrong.</p><p>It is important to remark that a NoA answer is different to a "None of the answers above is correct" answer. The former means that the system does not return any candidate answer because it is not confident about giving the correct answer, while the latter means that the system rejects the other candidate answers but returns a response that will be assessed as Right or Wrong.</p><p>Evaluation of systems given was given from two perspectives following the format of last editions:</p><p>1. A question-answering approach, as in the traditional evaluation performed in past campaigns, where we just evaluate the ability of systems answering a set of questions and rank systems according to the final value given by a measure. 2. A reading-test evaluation, obtaining figures for each particular reading test and topics. This perspective permits us to evaluate whether a system was able to understand a document and to what degree. More in detail, we evaluate if the system is able to pass each test, in a similar way to humans with RC tests. This is a kind of evaluation studied with more detail in the pilot Entrance Exams task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Evaluation Measure</head><p>We keep c@1 as the main evaluation in this edition. c@1 was introduced in ResPubliQA 2009 <ref type="bibr" coords="11,476.54,193.38,11.69,9.02" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and is fully described in <ref type="bibr" coords="11,105.17,205.38,10.56,9.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The formulation of c@1 is given in Formula (1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="11,239.22,228.85,100.79,26.38">c @ 1= 1 n ( n R +n U n R n )</formula><p>(1) where n R : number of questions correctly answered. n U : number of questions unanswered. n: total number of questions</p><p>The main feature of c@1 is its consideration of unanswered questions. c@1 acknowledges unanswered questions in the proportion that a system answers questions correctly, which is measured using the traditional accuracy (the proportion of questions correctly answered). Thus, a higher accuracy over answered questions, which might be associated to a better validation, would give more value to unanswered questions, and therefore, a higher final c@1 value. By selecting this measure we wanted to encourage the development of systems able to check the correctness of their responses because NoA answers add value to the final value, while incorrect answers do not.</p><p>As a secondary measure, we also provided scores according to accuracy (see Formula (2)), the traditional measure applied to past QA evaluations at CLEF. We define accuracy considering both answered and unanswered questions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="11,244.86,442.01,119.91,26.77">accuracy= n R +n UR n (2)</formula><p>where n R : number of questions correctly answered. n UR : number of unanswered questions whose candidate answer was correct. n: total number of questions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Question Answering Perspective Evaluation</head><p>The Question Answering perspective is focused on measuring systems' performance over a set of questions without considering the ability of a system to pass tests associated with documents. This is an approach similar to the one applied in QA@CLEF campaigns before 2010.</p><p>Then, the information considered for each system at this level is:  Total number of questions ANSWERED. This number is divided into: o total number of questions ANSWERED with a RIGHT answer, o total number of questions ANSWERED with a WRONG answer.</p><p> Total number of questions UNANSWERED (a NoA response was given). This number is divided into: o total number of questions UNANSWERED with a RIGHT candidate answer, o total number of questions UNANSWERED with a WRONG candidate answer, o total number of questions UNANSWERED with an EMPTY candidate answer.</p><p>The following scores are calculated from this information:  An overall c@1 score over the whole collection (the set with 160 questions),  A c@1 score for each topic (40 questions for each topic),  An overall accuracy score (over the 160 questions of the test collection, considering also the candidate answers given to unanswered questions as it has been explained above),  The proportion of answers correctly discarded (see Formula (3)) in order to evaluate the validation performance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="12,211.80,148.32,184.74,30.27">UE UW UR UE UW discarded n + n + n n + n = correctly (3)</formula><p>where:</p><p>n UR : number of unanswered questions whose candidate answer was correct n UW : number of unanswered questions whose candidate answer was incorrect n UE : number of unanswered questions whose candidate answer was empty</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Reading Perspective Evaluation</head><p>The objective of the reading perspective evaluation is to offer information about the performance of a system "understanding" the meaning of each single document. This understanding is evaluated by means of multiple-choice tests with ten questions per document. That is, each system has to pass a test about a given document similar to the evaluation of RC of new language learners. As we said above, this kind of evaluation is studied more in detail in a pilot task of this edition.</p><p>This evaluation is performed taking as reference the c@1 scores achieved for each test (one document with its ten questions). Then, these c@1 scores can be aggregated at topic and global levels in order to obtain the following values:  Median, average and standard deviation of c@1 scores at test level, grouped by topic,  Overall median, average and standard deviation of c@1 values at test level.</p><p>The median c@1 is provided under the consideration that it can be sometimes more informative at reading level than average values. This is because median is less affected by outliers than average, and therefore it provides more information about the ability of a system to understand a text.</p><p>We consider that a system passes a test according to this evaluation perspective if it achieves a score equal or higher than 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">NCA Baseline</head><p>After previous years' experience, we realized that advancing the state of the art requires systems ability to decide whether all candidate answers were incorrect or not. In this way, systems able to take this decision should be rewarded over systems that just rank answers. For this reason, we introduced an additional option "none of the above answers are correct" (NCA), that was the correct option in the 39% of questions. Thus, this is the baseline for a dummy system that always return NCA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Random Baseline</head><p>This baseline randomly selects an answer from the set of candidate answers. Since there is one correct option among five, the overall result of this random baseline is 0.2 (both for accuracy and for c@1). Systems applying a reasonable kind of processing and reasoning should be able to outperform this baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">PARTICIPATION</head><p>From an initial amount of 39 groups that registered for the main task and signed the license agreement to download the background collections, 19 of them finally submitted at least one run, resulting in 77 monolingual runs in four languages (Bulgarian, English, Spanish, and Romanian). There were no Arabic runs this year and neither were there any cross-lingual runs. Tables 8-10 show a characterization of runs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Reading Perspective</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="13,91.20,420.54,10.02,9.02" target="#tab_12">11</ref> shows the average results for each one of the 16 reading comprehension tests according to c@1. The Table shows that, except for Test 3, the mean value was higher than the baseline of 0.2, a similar situation to last year. Average 0.38 0.27 0.20 0.26 0.24 0.29 0.32 0.37 0.26 0.24 0.25 0.29 0.24 0.30 0.25 0.24 However, the mean values for all the tests were still under 0.5, which is the score needed to pass the evaluation from the reading perspective. This is the same result as last year and suggests that systems are still far away from obtaining satisfactory results according to this perspective. Table <ref type="table" coords="13,94.12,654.48,9.99,9.02" target="#tab_13">12</ref> shows the mean scores per topic. The scores across topics are within five percentage points which seems very consistent in difficulty, especially as the topics themselves are so diverse. This year the Music questions were slightly easier whereas last year (2012) the AIDS questions were slightly easier than the others.</p><p>Apendix I and II show these results for al submitted runs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Question Answering perspective</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="14,92.01,94.86,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_14">13</ref> shows the results of all submitted runs grouped by language. Most of the systems were able to beat the baseline (only 5 runs performed lower, compared to 8 in 2012), with at least a system per language able to do so. Once again, this amount is higher than in 2011, when only half of the systems outperformed the baseline. So there seems to be a progressive improvement in systems' performance over the years. Considering all languages, 93% of questions received at least one correct answer by at least one system. The best results were obtained in English, where the highest score was obtained by jucs1302enen with 0.59. This value is 24 percentage points higher than the next system (kule1304enen at 0.35). In 2012 the jucs group also submitted the best run, jucs12013enen with a score 0.65. So, for a second year running, jucs was the only system able to pass the evaluation according to the reading perspective. Moreover, their individual scores were well over 0.5 in every topic except Topic 3, Climate Change (where their score was 0.3).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="15,90.56,525.12,10.05,9.02" target="#tab_15">14</ref> shows the distribution of correct and incorrect answers for all runs. Table <ref type="table" coords="17,91.07,133.86,10.03,9.02" target="#tab_16">15</ref> shows the difference in performance for each type of question. Notice that consistently, all systems perform better on the auxiliary questions that require less inference than main questions. Also results over questions with modality and negation are lower for all runs than the score obtain for all questions.</p><p>However, the most important result is that scores show how systems can't decide whether there is a correct answer or not among candidates. This is a very important challenge that we have to continue addressing in future.  <ref type="table" coords="18,129.02,451.86,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_17">16</ref> compares the performance of systems in the three editions of QA4MRE. Results show how introducing NCA questions together with modality and negation made the task more difficult this year. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Unanswered Questions</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="18,90.64,591.36,10.03,9.02" target="#tab_18">17</ref> below shows the percentage of correct and NoA answers for different question types over the last three years. Percentages of correct answers are lowest for Causal questions at 22.56% with Purpose following at 24.19%. Which-istrue and Factoid are similar at 25.44% and 25.92%, while the highest is Method at 30.64%. Similar to last year, the Causal questions are the hardest to answer. This corresponds to the intuition that the need for inference in such questions can cause difficulties for systems. However, while Method questions were the most difficult questions after Causal ones last year, this time around the Method questions seems to be the easiest. It may be that easier Method questions were set this year. NoA scores are similar across question types although, interestingly, the number is lowest at 6.32% for Causal questions even though these were the hardest. It seems therefore that for Causal questions, systems were less inclined to withhold their answers than for other types, but then in answering such questions they were less successful than for other types. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Analysis of Auxiliary Questions</head><p>As stated above, various Auxiliary questions were added to the test set, each such question being a simplification of a particular Main question. Simplifications took three main forms: hypernym replacement, noun phrase synonymy and verbal entailment: 16 were hyponym replacement (HYP), 18 were noun phrase synonymy (NPS), and 10 were verbal entailment (VEN).</p><p>In total there were 44 Auxiliary questions, seventeen being simplifications of Main questions themselves and 27 being simplifications of the correct answers to Main questions. The simplifications were designed to identify the (in)ability of a system to perform specific inferences; essentially, the main question required the inference while the auxiliary one did not. In consequence, we were looking for instances where systems found auxiliary questions easier to answer than their main counterparts. We identified two means of studying the data. First, we looked at how many systems answered main questions correctly as against how many answered the corresponding auxiliary ones correctly (Tables <ref type="table" coords="19,476.45,636.36,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_16">15</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="19,508.07,636.36,7.92,9.02" target="#tab_18">17</ref>). We expected to see more systems answering auxiliary questions correctly, if indeed they were easier to answer. Secondly we looked at how many main-auxiliary question pairs had the property that more systems answered the auxiliary question correctly than answered the main question correctly. These results are shown in Tables <ref type="table" coords="19,415.41,672.36,10.03,9.02" target="#tab_17">16</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="19,446.59,672.36,8.34,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref>. We were expecting most pairs to have this property.</p><p>Overall, our expectations were fulfilled since Auxiliary question simplification led to a score increase in 36 out of 44 cases (81.82%): 13 out of 17 for question simplification (Table <ref type="table" coords="19,309.39,720.35,8.88,9.02" target="#tab_17">16</ref>) and 23 out of 27 for answer simplification (Table <ref type="table" coords="19,525.58,720.35,7.94,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref>). Where scores increased, they did so strongly, by 244.21%: in other words there were about two-and-a-half times as many correct responses on average for Auxiliary questions relative to their corresponding Main questions, in cases where there was any increase. This appears to support our hypothesis that certain key inferences were causing systems to get answers wrong. There was a big score difference between simplifying the Question and simplifying the Answer. Question simplisimplification led to a 58.96% increase, while Answer simplification gave 348.91%. It appears that answer simplification makes a question much easier to answer than question simplification.</p><p>Question Simplification. The breakdown of this by simplification type is shown in Tables <ref type="table" coords="20,443.56,122.88,9.99,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="20,474.81,122.88,8.31,9.02" target="#tab_20">19</ref>. These tables only consider main questions that have an Auxiliary counterpart. Table <ref type="table" coords="20,347.91,134.88,10.05,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref> shows the counts of Main questions correct, the equivalent Auxiliary questions correct and the percentage difference. These figures are then broken down by simplification type (HYP, NPS or VEN) in the last nine columns. Recall that question type and domain are two different ways of breaking down the same set of question pairs. For operational reasons there no auxiliary questions for the Alzheimer's topic. Table <ref type="table" coords="20,432.48,194.88,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref> shows that the overall percentage difference between main and auxiliary in correct answers was 25%. Concerning topic, Climate was the lowest (9%) and Aids the highest (39%). Concerning question type, Cause was the highest at 52% while Purpose, Fact and True fall in the range 20-30%. This suggests that Cause questions require the most complex reasoning. Interestingly, Method questions were worse in the auxiliary case. Problems in formulating the auxiliary questions could be the reason here.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="20,92.53,266.88,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_20">19</ref> shows by question-aux pairs of a particular type, in how many of the group falling into that type the Auxiliary question has more correct answers than the Main question. The figures are counts of question pairs, not counts of correct answers. So, for example, there were six main questions that were of Factoid type (in the Auxiliary question pilot) and for five of these, there were more correct answers for the corresponding Auxiliary questions. Generally this table shows a trend of increase in the number of correct answers to an auxiliary question relative to the main question. The numbers are of course small so it is hard to identify trends within question type or topic.  <ref type="table" coords="21,152.85,86.88,10.05,9.02" target="#tab_19">18</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="21,183.15,86.88,8.35,9.02" target="#tab_20">19</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="21,224.30,86.88,10.00,9.02" target="#tab_21">20</ref> shows that the overall percentage difference between main and auxiliary in correct answers was 122%, considerably more than for question simplification. Concerning topic, Climate was once again the lowest (18%) and Aids the highest (179%), with Music close behind (167%). Concerning question type, Cause was now the lowest at 41% while the highest was True (187%). True (i.e. which-is-true) questions often ask for a difficult choice between statements about the text, statements that can take many different forms. So it is reasonable to expect a big improvement here. Concerning Table <ref type="table" coords="21,258.29,146.88,8.34,9.02" target="#tab_22">21</ref>, this once again shows a trend of increasing scores for the auxiliary questions. To summarize, the aim was to see if simplifications of a question would increase a system's performance. The indications are that this actually occurred. The implication is that the Auxiliary question approach could be used to dig deeper into the exact workings of a system and in particular the performance of individual components within that system, while keeping with the multiple choice answer format which allows complex questions but still permits automatic evaluation. However, this was a pilot study only and reservations should be noted: Firstly, there were only 44 Auxiliary questions out of 240 Main questions which is only 18.33%, and 44 is not a big enough number to comprise a representative sample; Secondly the distribution of simplification types was not controlled; Thirdly, the exact nature of simplifications was not that closely specified or validated, as it is a very complex matter and this was a small part of the project; Finally, in some cases, the simplification substituted a direct substring of the text, which systems could then match using string processing and hence answer correctly. Such a substitution might possibly not be pinning down the lack of an inference at all but simply turning QA into string comparison. Subject to the above remarks, this pilot study did seem to identify strong effects and to set out a framework which could be refined in future evaluation frameworks. This suggests a more systematic study and analysis of Question and Answer simplification in future years, using additional simplification operations, and hence allowing system builders to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of their systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Analysis of the Use of External Knowledge</head><p>This task tries also to promote the use and combination of external sources of knowledge in order to help answering questions as it has been said above. This year participants were allowed to submit a maximum of 10 runs. Run 01 had to be produced using only the Background Collection provided by the organizations-no external resources were allowed. Participants that did not use the Background Collections submitted their runs starting from number 02. Runs 02 to 10 were permitted to make use of any additional resources. Out of 11 groups, 6 submitted also the first run. These runs can be seen below in  On the left pair of columns are the submitted '1' runs that were only permitted to use the Background Collection and no other source of knowledge. On the right pair of columns are the best non-'1' runs submitted by the same groups. It is clear that the average c@1 scores for the '1' runs (0.23) and the non-'1' runs (0.22) are very similar. Viewed individually, nara, vens, btbn and ontol were all better when using just the Background Collection, with the biggest difference being nara which scored 0.24 with non-'1' and 0.4 more (0.28) with '1'. nara was also the best scoring run in this group (but not the best overall as some groups did not submit '1' runs) and did seem to gain some benefit from the Background Collection. On the other hand, buap and evma were worse in '1' than non-'1' though the difference was only 0.1 in each case. The differences, whether increases or decreases, are small except for nara, so it is hard to decide whether the Background Collections are beneficial to systems or not.</p><p>Generally the use of the Background Collections on the one hand, and how to measure such use on the other hand, remain unanswered questions. Systems could be asked to 'prove' that they have used a background document by for example quoting a supporting passage from it, but it is hard to prevent such use from being reverse engineered once the system has first found the required information elsewhere. In addition, the extraction of simple supporting passages is not the only valid use to which a background collection can be put; the use could be more intangible, such as extracting statistical data or causal rules.</p><p>Finally, in considering the '1' runs it is important to remember that the best runs overall by c@1 on main questions were jucs1302enen (0.55) and kule1306enen (0.3), neither of which submitted '1' runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6">Analysis of Systems</head><p>The table in Appendix 3 summarises the set of techniques that participants have reported are being used in their systems. A more detailed explanation of each system is given by participants in the Working Notes.</p><p>Most of systems perform question analysis as it was shown in last editions. However, while in the last edition questions patterns were automatically obtained, this year's participants seem to prefer to create patterns manually.</p><p>The most common techniques applied for processing texts were, as usual, PoS tagging, NER and dependency analysis in a lower proportion. Nevertheless, participants did not report the application of deeper analysis techniques, except the vens system, which uses semantic role labelling for its logic representation. Therefore, it seems systems continue relying on lexical and simple syntactic analysis, which do not allow all the phenomena in language to be captured and limit the final performance of systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The task this year was significantly harder than in previous years, due to the introduction of NCA questions, and questions with modality and negation issues. While this year's results show some improvement compared to first year, especially with respect to the respective baselines, the majority of systems are still far from being able to pass a Reading Comprehension test. Nevertheless, best systems are, in general, very close to achieving this goal.</p><p>The NoA option (i.e., system unable to determine with enough confidence an answer) shows an interesting trend. Comparing the overall NoA performance over the three years of QA4MRE. It is quite striking that the percentage of NoA answers returned by systems seems to halve every successive year: from around 40% in 2011 to under 20% to under 10% this year. This may suggest that systems are becoming more confident in their answering ability and hence more reluctant to use NoA answers unless they are sure these are appropriate. But the fact is that in most cases systems increase the proportion of wrong answer when they decide to give answer.</p><p>When we defined the task we kept in mind three main ideas: that we are developing a validation technology able to determine if a particular answer is correct or not; that knowledge is crucial for understanding; and that a large set of documents related to a topic could be an additional source of background knowledge. We discuss each in turn.</p><p>Regarding the second and third issues, results suggest that the use of external resources helps in general to improve results, although not so clearly in the case of Background Collections. Most participants do not seem to know how to gather usable background knowledge from these collections, while it seems that other external resources provide greater benefit. We need to decide whether to continue collection Background Collections, since the organization is spending a lot of resources doing so every year <ref type="foot" coords="23,201.66,339.79,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Somehow, we expected to gather some attention to Open Information Extraction and similar research fields aimed at acquiring knowledge from textual sources to enable textual inferences.</p><p>The first question is whether the technology developed so far is just ranking the options or is actually validating them. The difference is important: What happens if we don't provide the options? Most systems use a kind of similarity measure or they don't use validation at all. Thus, more than validating the answers, systems are ranking them. This led us to introduce a change this year: an explicit assessment of the ability to reject candidate answers when they are incorrect, using the "None of the answers above are correct" option. Maybe due to the novelty or to a surprise effect, the fact is that systems performed consistently worse over these questions. Given the fact that 39% of questions were of this type, none of the systems except one, was able to achieve this baseline.</p><p>It is important to notice the difference between NCA questions and NoA responses. Systems should use NoA response when the risk of choosing a wrong answer is high. In order to choose NCA option as response, systems must be able to find evidences about the incorrectness of the candidate answer. This must lead research towards the development of the ability to reject answers more than the ability to accept them. This is in accordance to the main QA scenario were we expect some hypothesis over-generation that answer validation modules must manage. For this reason, we'll work in future about how the evaluation methodology can reward systems with this desirable feature.
