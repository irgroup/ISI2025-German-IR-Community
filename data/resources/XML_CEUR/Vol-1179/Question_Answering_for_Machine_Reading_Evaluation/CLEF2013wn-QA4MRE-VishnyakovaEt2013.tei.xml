<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For the machine-reading task of biomedical texts about the Alzheimer disease we have used a Question-Answering approach by adapting functionalities of Question-Answering (Q-A) engine EAGLi. We didn't involve any other Natural Language Processing method. As a knowledge store we used the biggest resource of biomedical literature -MEDLINE. Our final results showed that the best run was without using the filter of "stop words" in queries. Run 1 and Run 2 provided answers to all 40 Question, while Run 3 and 4 provided answers to 5 questions; Run 5 answered to 6 questions. These results can be tentatively explained by the limits of the Boolean search we chose in the Q-A engine.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We report on the original integration of an automatic question-answering pipeline that we have developed to perform machine-reading task of biomedical texts about the Alzheimer disease. This task can be basically described as an «open book test» where questions are designed to teach how to use a provided ability in order to find the required information. Regularly, the questions on an open book test are about explanation, evaluation, or comparison of things from the text. The answer to such questions will not appear in a single paragraph in your text-or even on a single page. The test, when performed by the user or by an automatic reading system can be simplified into the following workflow:</p><p>1. Retrieval of documents given a particular query (a particular question) in a particular document repository; 2. Selection of articles: selection of a subset of articles is based on the title and the abstract; 3. Reading of a particular article (or Passage retrieval for an automat). This step is essential for navigating through the information and for the detection of relevant patterns. 4. Extraction of information: a particular passage is analyzed to obtain a representation of the level of entities such as proteins, diseases, methods used to generate a particular result (e.g. yeast 2-hybrid), evidence codes (e.g. automatic inference, direct interactions…); 5. Feedback: this step is optional; it aims at using the generated annotation to improve or refine the search initiated in step 1.</p><p>The Organizers of the test performed step 1 and Step 2 by providing articles and questions.</p><p>Step 3 and Step 4 form the core of the current test where one should know the basic answer to the question and look for the information from the defined resource that will support the answer.</p><p>Step 5 is often ignored by designers of text mining systems and was not mandatory for the reading test.</p><p>The system we designed tentatively covers all these steps. In order to pass the test we have used a Question-Answering approach. As a search tool we have used a Question-Answering (Q-A) engine called EAGLi <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.99,469.31,10.66,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is a question-answering and search engine with terminology-powered navigation and knowledge extraction skills (Gene Ontology, Swiss-Prot keywords, Protein-protein interactions, Medical Subject Headings...) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,154.94,505.31,11.30,8.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[3] <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.55,505.31,11.30,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,239.64,505.31,3.79,8.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The role of library is played by the biggest resource of biomedical literature -MEDLINE. This resource contains journal citations and abstracts for biomedical literature from around the world. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data and Methods</head><p>A background collection of the Alzheimer's Disease Literature Corpus, and test documents about Alzheimer's disease were provided. The test set included 4 reading tests (four full articles about Alzheimer disease). Each reading test had one single document, with 10 questions and a set of five choices per question. In total there were 40 questions and 200 choices/options. We didn't use directly any method of Natural Language Processing area. We have used Boolean method <ref type="bibr" coords="3,214.25,539.87,11.71,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref> [5] of querying EAGLi <ref type="bibr" coords="3,323.95,539.87,10.66,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Our approach use the possibility of EAGLi engine to retrieve relevant citations in a given collection from the input query. As an input for EAGLi Q-A engine we generated queries constructed by a conjunction of given question and provided possible answers to this question (if a question has 5 answers it means that as input to EAGLi our system will construct 5 queries of "Question+AnswerX" type, where X is an id of a provided answer). The performance optimization of EAGLi supports utilization of "stop words" function <ref type="bibr" coords="3,458.86,611.87,11.69,8.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> in order to refine the list of returned documents. On the output we receive the number of documents returned regarding the provided query. The system votes for the answer, which returns most documents from MEDLINE. The general workflow of the system is shown on the Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="3,205.11,659.90,3.89,8.96" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>We have generated 5 runs in total. Each run represents different combination of the parameters, See Table <ref type="table" coords="4,215.82,162.18,3.71,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and Conclusion</head><p>In total we have submitted 5 runs, see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,318.64,649.67,3.76,8.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Run 1 was using "stop words" filter and answered 4 questions correctly out of 40; Run 2 was without "stop words" filter and answered 5 questions correctly; Run 3 was the same as Run 1, but our sys-tem provided no answers if DIFF was less than 5%. This run provided 0 correct answers. Run 4 is the same, as Run 3, but DIFF was less than 2%. This run returned as well 0 correct answers. Run 5 was without "stop words" and provided no answers if DIFF was less than 5%, but surprisingly it provided 1 correct answer. Our results showed that the way we have designed our system did not support the process of text understanding. The current combination of Q-A functionalities was not able to answer correct to all questions. Although current results seem suggesting that QA can help in machine reading tasks by providing access to relevant contents, it is worth noticing that the effectiveness of our system could be improved by specializing some of the components and most probably by changing Boolean search mode to vectorial search mode. When designing the system, we somehow customize a rather generic text-processing pipeline to answer the specific needs of QA4MRE task.</p><p>Considering that some of questions had no answer it implies that Boolean mode was an impropriate choice. Indeed, the Boolean mode does not process negational information but provides documents with given answers. At the same time, the utilization of the vectorial mode <ref type="bibr" coords="5,245.93,449.49,11.69,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref> could retrieve documents by their similarity to the provided one.</p><p>We still believe that it is possible to achieve good results in the current task of QA4MRE by supporting results with Q-A engine usage. Finally, we plan to further investigate how a question-answering engine can be integrated into a machine reading tasks, in particular to address situations when the provided article has no explicit answers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,129.86,377.66,335.48,8.10;3,130.22,388.58,334.88,8.10;3,285.79,399.62,23.72,8.10;3,124.70,147.35,351.00,221.55"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
