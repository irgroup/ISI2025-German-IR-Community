<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In 2013, the tenth edition of the medical task of the Image-CLEF benchmark was organized. For the first time, the ImageCLEFmed workshop takes place in the United States of America at the annual AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) meeting even though the task was organized as in previous years in connection with the other ImageCLEF tasks. Like 2012, a subset of the open access collection of PubMed Central was distributed. This year, there were four subtasks: modality classification, compound figure separation, image-based and case-based retrieval. The compound figure separation task was included due to the large number of multipanel images available in the literature and the importance to separate them for targeted retrieval. More compound figures were also included in the modality classification task to make it correspond to the distribution in the full database. The retrieval tasks remained in the same format as in previous years but a larger number of tasks were available for image-based and case-based tasks. This paper presents an analysis of the techniques applied by the ten groups participating 2013 in ImageCLEFmed.</p></div>

The same format as in 2012 was followed and a new task was added, the compound figure separation. Characterisation of compound figures is often difficult, as they can contain features of various image types. Focusing search on the sub figures can lead to better results. In 2013, the modality classification task also included a larger amount of compound figures to make the task more realistic and correspond to the distribution in the database. The four tasks of 2013 are:</p><p>modality classification; compound figure separation; image-based retrieval; case-based retrieval.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ImageCLEFmed tasks in more detail as well as the participation in each of the tasks. Section 3 presents the main results of the tasks and compares results within the participating groups and the techniques employed. Section 4 concludes the paper.</p><p>2 Participation, Data Sets, Tasks, Ground Truth This section describes the four tasks organized in ImageCLEFmed 2013. The datasets and the ground truth provided for the evaluation campaign are explained in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participation</head><p>Like 2012, over sixty groups registered for the medical tasks and obtained access to the data sets. Ten of the registered groups submitted results to the medical tasks compared to 17 in 2012 with a total of 166 valid runs submitted, slightly fewer runs than in 2012. The smaller number of participants and submitted runs can be due to a change in the evaluation schedule of CLEF 2013 and may also be due to the fact that the event will be organized outside of Europe.</p><p>51 runs were submitted to the modality classification task, 4 runs to the compound figure separation task, 9 runs to the image retrieval task and 45 runs to the case-based retrieval task. As in previous years, the number of runs per group was limited to ten per subtask. The following groups submitted at least one run:</p><p>-AAUITEC (Institute of Information Participants marked with a star had not participated in the medical task in 2012.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Datasets</head><p>In ImageCLEFmed 2013, the same database as in 2012 was supplied to the participants. The database contains over 300,000 images of 75,000 articles of the biomedical open access literature that allow free redistribution of the data. The ImageCLEFmed database is a subset of PubMed Central<ref type="foot" coords="3,389.73,234.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">3</ref> containing in total over 1.5 million images of over 600,000 articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Modality Classification</head><p>The modality classification task was first introduced in 2010. The goal of this task is to classify the images into medical modalities and other images types, such as Computed Tomography, xray or general graphs. A modality hierarchy of 38 classes of which 31 appear in the data was used <ref type="bibr" coords="3,378.40,332.57,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Using the modality information, the retrieval results could often be improved in the past by filtering our non-relevant image types <ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.77,356.48,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The same hierarchy as in ImageCLEFmed 2012 was used (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,249.33,368.43,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).  • [GT AB] Tables and forms</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,140.99,471.32,223.12,174.65">• [DRU S] Ultrasound • [DRM R] Magnetic Resonance • [DRCT ] Computerized Tomography • [DRXR] X-Ray, 2D Radiography • [DRAN ] Angiography • [DRP E] PET • [DRCO] Combined modalities in one image -[DV xx] Visible light photography (3 categories): • [DV DM ] Dermatology, skin • [DV EN ] Endoscopy • [DV OR] Other organs -[DSxx] Printed signals, waves (3 categories): • [DSEE] Electroencephalography • [DSEC] Electrocardiography • [DSEM ] Electromyography</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,158.68,518.49,190.26,141.28">• [GP LI] Program listing • [GF IG] Statistical figures, graphs, charts • [GSCR] Screenshots • [GF LO] Flowcharts • [GSY S] System overviews • [GGEN ] Gene sequence • [GGEL] Chromatography, Gel • [GCHE] Chemical structure • [GM AT ] Mathematics, formulae • [GN CP ] Non-clinical photos • [GHDR] Hand-drawn sketches 2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Compound Figure Separation</head><p>In the ImageCLEFmed 2012 data set <ref type="bibr" coords="5,296.95,139.31,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> between 40% and 60% of the figures are compound or multipanel figures. Making the content of the compound figures accessible for targeted search can improve retrieval accuracy. For this reason the detection of compound figures and their separation into sub figures is considered an important task. Examples for compound figures can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,456.94,187.13,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.  The ground truth for the dataset was generated in a semi-automatic way, using a two-step approach: first, an automated separation process (using the technique described in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,238.23,483.97,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) was run on both image sets in order to obtain a general overview of the subfigures. The automatic results were then manually corrected. Missing lines were added and incorrect lines removed, whereas often the lines were only slightly changed. Separating lines rather than bounding boxes were used to separate subfigures. The evaluation then required to have a minimum overlap between the ground truth and the data supplied by the groups in their runs.</p><p>The terminology used in the evaluation is:</p><p>- -For each subfigure f i defined in the ground truth the best matching candidate subfigure will be determined. Only one candidate is used in case there are several matches. -The main metric used to compare subfigures is the overlap between a candidate subfigure and the ground truth. To be considered a valid match the overlap between a candidate subfigure and a subfigure from the ground truth must correspond to at least 66% of the candidate's size. If the best candidate is an acceptable match, the number of correctly matched figures C F correct will be incremented. Since only one candidate subfigure can be assigned to each of the subfigures from the ground truth,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,330.14,428.79,70.28,12.48">C F correct ≤ K F GT .</formula><p>-The maximum score for the figure is 1 and the normalisation factor used to compute the score will be the maximum between the number of subfigures in the ground truth K F GT and the number of candidate subfigures K F C .</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="6,266.25,485.08,95.83,26.50">S F = C F correct max(K F GT , K F C )</formula><p>.</p><p>Therefore the maximum score is obtained only when the number of candidates K F C is equal to the number of subfigures in the ground truth K F GT and all of them are correctly matched:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="6,266.47,562.28,99.36,12.69">C F correct = K F C = K F GT .</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,165.83,584.61,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_3">3</ref> contains examples showing different candidates being validated against a reference figure (which contains 3 subfigures), along with their scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Image-Based Retrieval</head><p>The image-based retrieval task is the classical medical retrieval task, similar to those organized each year since 2004 with the target unit being the image. In 2013, 35 queries were given to the participants so more than in previous years. The 22 queries used in 2012 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,267.64,130.95,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> were part of the 35 queries that all contain text (in English, Spanish, French and German) with 1-7 sample images for each query. As in previous years, the queries were classified into textual, mixed and semantic, based on the methods that are expected to yield the best results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Case-Based Retrieval</head><p>The case-based retrieval task has been running since 2009. In this task, a case description, with patient demographics, limited symptoms and test results including imaging studies, is provided (but not the final diagnosis). As in previous years, the goal is to retrieve cases including images that might best suit the provided case description. This year the 26 topics distributed in 2012 were also part of the 35 final topics. Each of the topics was accompanied by one or two images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>This section describes the results of ImageCLEF 2013. Runs are ordered based on the tasks (modality classification, compound figure separation, image-based and case-based retrieval) and the techniques used (visual, textual, mixed). In 2013, several groups used the ImageCLEF 2012 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,353.82,369.28,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> database to optimize the parameters <ref type="bibr" coords="7,186.35,381.23,12.45,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,198.80,381.23,4.15,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,202.95,381.23,12.45,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>

In 2013, the IBM Multimedia Analytics and FCSE <ref type="bibr" coords="7,162.87,449.59,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> obtained the best results in the the three types of runs (visual, textual, mixed).Best results were obtained using multimodal techniques (81.68%) follow by visual techniques (80.79%). The best run using textual methods alone obtained a lower accuracy (64.17%). Only ITI <ref type="bibr" coords="7,322.53,485.45,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> explored hierarchical approaches among the hierarchy distributed and some groups investigated a separation between compound and non-compound images before classifying the remaining categories <ref type="bibr" coords="7,180.78,521.32,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,197.94,521.32,11.62,8.74" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>Techniques Used for Visual Classification The IBM team achived the best results in the visual classification.FCSE <ref type="bibr" coords="7,307.98,560.48,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> was the second best group (77.14%) using a spatial pyramid in combination with dense sampling using an oppo-nentSIFT descriptor for each image patch. Finally, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with χ 2 kernel were used as a classifier.

MedGIFT <ref type="bibr" coords="9,265.01,282.46,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> achieved the best result in one of its runs but it simply serves as a point of reference, since it was also used when the separating lines were drawn <ref type="bibr" coords="9,210.48,306.37,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and thus has an advantage over other techniques. ITI <ref type="bibr" coords="9,465.09,306.37,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> achived 69.27% using a combination of figure caption analysis, panel border detection and panel label recognition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>After one decade of running the ImageCLEF medical task, in 2013 Image-CLEFmed is organized at the annual AMIA meeting in the form of a workshop. The task had 10 groups submitting 166 valid runs to the four subtasks. The main novelty in 2013 was the inclusion of a new task, the compound figure separation task. In its first year three groups joined this complex task. More compound figures were included into the modality classification, so the training and test set are more difficult and correspond to the reality of the database, now. The other two tasks, image and case based retrieval, remained in the same format as in previous years but had a larger number of retrieval topics. As in previous years, visual, textual or multimodal techniques can all perform best depending on the situation. For the modality classification, a mixed run achieved the best accuracy. For the image-based retrieval task, the highest MAP was achieved by a multimodal run. In the case-based retrieval task, textual techniques obtained the best results. Finally, for the compound figure separation task only visual and mixed techniques were explored, with visual techniques leading to best results.</p><p>In 2013, many groups used ImageCLEFmed 2012 database to optimize the parameters. Many of the techniques used had already been employed in previous years. This shows the utility of past campaigns, which provide databases as well as information regarding tools used by other participants. ImageCLEF conducts participative research and experimentation among free and reusable collections and has shown an important impact in visual medical information retrieval.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,134.77,357.38,345.83,7.89;4,134.77,368.36,159.64,7.86;4,156.64,116.21,301.76,226.32"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
