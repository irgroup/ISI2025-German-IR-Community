<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Social networks have become a large repository of comments which can extract multiple information. Twitter is one of the most widespread social networks and larger and is therefore an important source for detecting states of opinion, events and happenings before even the mainstream media. Topic detection is important to discover areas of interest that arise in the tweets. We have used classical systems for a similarity matrix and we have used community detection techniques. The results have been good and allows us to study new possibilities.</p></div>

Its importance is shown where it is present in virtually all areas of life (social, economic, education ...) and covers any topic (sports, culture, entertainment, industry, science).</p><p>If we value the importance of this network in quantitative terms, it is necessary to refer to the volume of tweets generated every day, in June 2011, about 200 million, a number that is increasing- <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.97,174.18,10.69,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. If assessment in qualitative terms we do need to consider how their influence is reflected in the many social events that retrasmiten real time in order to gain visibility as well as the large number of original messages that become spread (retweets), so you can consider even that Twitter does become niche opinion, since a message created by a person (either original or a fragment of another work as a newspaper headline or an extract of news) can be retweeted by another or others who in turn relay it again causing a diffusion effect in clusters.</p><p>It is true that much of the information provided is completely irrelevant tweets, it is also necessary to consider that in many cases the messages isolated from their context lose value, but also a very rich source of information because it compiles the relevant information condensed for users, whether individuals, institutions or companies that are the highlights news, opinions or feelings, information would be very difficult to collect by other channels and is therefore by analyzing twitter messages is being used as feedstock for multiple investigations ranging from the role played by different types of users in the dissemination of information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,289.85,354.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref> a sociological analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,395.71,354.21,10.69,8.96" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, applications to classification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.90,366.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,296.57,366.21,11.72,8.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> [9], semantic analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.15,366.21,15.43,8.96" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, etc.</p><p>In this sense, the monitoring of comments, messages and opinions that are poured into Twitter is useful from the point of view of digital reputation people and institutions.</p><p>Early detection of issues and ratings on a particular subject can allow it to react appropriately and maintain a positive public image <ref type="bibr" coords="2,330.43,426.21,15.43,8.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Topic detection</head><p>Our group has focused on the topic detection, starting some exploratory work in this field. Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is an area that began as track in the Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.97,507.23,16.64,8.96" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and this year is celebrated in RepLab2013 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,451.54,507.23,15.34,8.96" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, the application of these techniques is relatively new to Twitter. Some notable works are those of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.37,531.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, who applied clustering techniques, or Petrovic <ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.75,531.23,15.34,8.96" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which also was an experimental collection of tweets that has been used in other studies, the Edinburgh Twitter Corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.37,555.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Mathioudakis and Koudas <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.67,555.23,16.76,8.96" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposed a system for detecting trending topics from a stream of tweets. Also on the detection of trending topics have worked Shariffi, Hotton and Kalita <ref type="bibr" coords="2,310.37,579.23,15.45,8.96" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, like Cheong and Lee <ref type="bibr" coords="2,414.55,579.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, although they work focuses on the temporal evolution of the trending topics.</p><p>The question is therefore how to determine the similarity between all pairs of tweets relating to a given entity. The similarity between two documents is one of the central problems in information retrieval and can be approached in various ways. One of the best known is to consider each document (tweet) as a bag of words and apply a classical scheme tf x idf.</p><p>The tweets, however, are documents with a number of special features that should be taken into account. Anta and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="3,285.05,162.18,16.76,8.96" target="#b19">[20]</ref> mention several of them. A issues 'classic' of using unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc. or stemming, in the case of tweets must add the emoticons, abbreviations, including a slang that medium itself, and as numerous abnormalities ortho-typographic. The brevity of the tweets is another important issue to consider <ref type="bibr" coords="3,173.54,210.18,15.36,8.96" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In our specific case, we find texts at least two possible languages: English and Spanish.</p><p>Finally we will make the graph representation of the tweets of the entities and we apply Social Network Analysis to our information <ref type="bibr" coords="3,319.27,258.18,15.43,8.96" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Social Network Analysis is a measurement tool allowing knowledge and structural analysis of the interactions between the actors of the analyzed network <ref type="bibr" coords="3,300.41,282.21,15.45,8.96" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>There is a wide range of indicators such as density, centrality, centralization, betweenness, closeness, etc.. that allow analysis of both network nodes as complete, although the detection of communities, groups. cliques, etc.., is a subject of great interest.</p><p>The strategy adopted in this work has been the application of techniques of Social Network Analysis, in particular communities detection techniques. In a social network G = (V,E) a community is a subgraph of entities 𝑉𝑐 ⊆ 𝑉 that are associated with common elements of interest. The elements that are part of the community can be topics, real-life people, places, events, etc. These techniques are based on detecting, in a network node groups with strong bonded between them. In our case the tweets would be the nodes of the network; a semantic similarity between two tweets mean a link between network nodes.</p><p>There are many techniques for detecting communities <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.51,474.23,16.76,8.96" target="#b23">[24]</ref> [ <ref type="bibr" coords="3,380.91,474.23,8.56,8.96" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.47,474.23,4.28,8.96" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,393.75,474.23,12.84,8.96" target="#b26">[27]</ref> as hierarchical clustering algorithms, methods based on cliques, grouping cuts, Girvan-Newman algorithm, etc. One widely used method is the analysis of modularity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.27,510.23,16.76,8.96" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (the number of links between groups is small, within groups is high), highlighting the Louvain algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,426.55,522.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>One method that is effective is showing the VOS clustering algorithm (visualization of similarities) and some jobs are proving more effective compared to other systems, especially for better performance than systems based on modularity in detecting small clusters <ref type="bibr" coords="3,159.50,582.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. It is a modification of the algorithm based on modularity where the weights are maximized differently <ref type="bibr" coords="3,264.53,594.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding VOS clustering technique, we can use the mapping to visualization VOS is very effective compared to other methods, adding a plus detection systems communities <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.70,642.23,15.43,8.96" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In this map, the colors indicate the density within each community, ranging from blue (low density) to red (high density). We can see the most important communities and placed in relation to each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our approach</head><p>Since this is the first time we participate in this work, our focus has been simple and without too many refinements. We have considered each tweet (within each entity) as a document whose basic features are the words it contains, and we have applied after heavy classic scheme tf x idf and cosine to construct a similarity matrix <ref type="bibr" coords="4,425.23,213.18,15.43,8.96" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Some specific issues applied in our work have been:</p><p>─ we have not made any distinction between languages of the tweets, possibly there are notable differences in the treatment applicable according to the language it is one or other one <ref type="bibr" coords="4,186.98,269.22,15.96,8.96" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,205.37,269.22,13.40,8.96" target="#b33">34]</ref> but in our case we have performed uniform lexical analysis all tweets ─ we applied a simple s-stemmer ─ we removed the words with less than 4 characters Additionally, we have considered discarded emoticons. We have considered hashtags and entities terms particularly interesting.</p><p>On the other hand, in numerous tweets appear weblinks, we have considered especially interesting, if two tweets have links to the same website we think that dealing with very similar issues. Thus, the URL of these links are considered equally as important characteristics of terms or the tweets.</p><p>Given the small number of terms present in a tweet, the co-occurrence of URLs, hashtags and entities are especially significant. Some studies apply techniques designed to increase the number of terms per tweet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,297.65,445.29,15.43,8.96" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, following the links and adding to the features of that tweet the words of the website referenced. Anta and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="4,451.42,457.29,15.43,8.96" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, however, report the amount of noise that this technique produces.</p><p>Other refinements possible, as the use of Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" coords="4,331.75,493.31,16.76,8.96" target="#b35">[36]</ref> for additional information and produce more accurate results have not been applied by us on this occasion.</p><p>Once the network weighted with the weights of the similarity, we proceeded to generate individualized networks for each of the entities under study. We obtained the number of communities (by VOS Clustering algorithm) of each of the entities, we have individualized the communities and thereafter we performed calculation on the density of each of the communities.</p><p>When we boarded the density term relationships and social networks we refer to a widespread concept. This can be defined as the proportion of links in a network relative to the total possible links (sparse versus dense networks). Other authors density defined as the interface between network members. The density is an indicator of social network analysis allows us to measure the extent to which a network is connected. We can say further that a dense network nodes have a very close relationship between them, confirming the theory that "the performance of a network has a positive association with the high density of the network" With these data we created two tasks:</p><p>1. reina_1: Topics were assigned to all tweets, depending on the community to which they belonged. Topic was assigned to all tweets, even if the community consisted of few documents. 2. reina_2: Filter was performed according to the density of each of the entities. We considered only communities with a density greater than 0.5. Topic was assigned only tweets belonging to these communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The results of our two task (reina_1 and reina_2) were as follows: The result of the measure F <ref type="bibr" coords="6,232.17,150.18,17.91,8.96" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (table <ref type="table" coords="6,277.47,150.18,3.64,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), as we can see has given better results the task reina_2 and furthermore their behavior with respect to the rest of the task has been very good. Note that the ratio obtained for this task is the lowest of all the set, (density filter). This filtering requires a revision in the threshold used to improve the ratio of tweets. In the comparison of the system pairs and UIR <ref type="bibr" coords="7,327.67,593.03,16.76,8.96" target="#b37">[38]</ref> (table <ref type="table" coords="7,375.29,593.03,4.17,8.96" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) reina_2 improves to reina_1 and continues to maintain good results with respect to total tasks of track.</p><p>With the working method we can visualize detected communities for a given entity. Show two different views (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="7,250.68,641.03,4.98,8.96">1</ref> and Fig 2 )of the entity RL2013D01E002, allowing us to obtain a representation of these communities, which eventually become the detection of specific topics in the entity.</p><p>This working method allows us to simultaneously perform a complete entity reduction in their various communities and establish the relationships between these communities, which offers a mechanism for relations between communities, and therefore the relationship among topics (Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="8,305.40,186.18,3.65,8.96">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We have raised a system of detection of topics differently but that has given a few good enough results.</p><p>Mixing basic scheme for generating the similarity matrix, and detection of communities promising results.</p><p>The use of a filtering network density has better result than without filtering.</p><p>The threshold used in filtering lowered the ratio of processed tweets.</p><p>In the future we need to try different schemes when generating the similarity matrix, try different community detection algorithms and use other filtering techniques.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,158.30,399.14,278.56,8.10;8,124.68,207.36,355.08,183.12"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .Fig. 3 .</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
