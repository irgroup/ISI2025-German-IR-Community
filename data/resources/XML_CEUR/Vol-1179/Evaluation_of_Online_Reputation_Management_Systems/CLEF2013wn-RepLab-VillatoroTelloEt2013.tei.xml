<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the participation of the Language and Reasoning Group of UAM at RepLab 2013 Profiling evaluation lab. We adopted Distributional Term Representations (DTR) for facing the following problems: i) filtering tweets that are related to an entity, and ii) identifying positive or negative implications for the entity's reputation, i.e., polarity for reputation. Distributional Term Representations help to overcome, to some extent, the small-length/high-sparsity issues. DTRs are a way to represent terms by means of contextual information, given by term co-occurrence statistics. In order to evaluate our approach, we compared the proposed approach against the traditional Bag-of-Words representation. Obtained results indicate that by means of DTRs it is possible to increase the reliability score of a profiling system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>From its inception in 2006, Twitter has become in one of the most important platform for microblog posts. Recent statistics reveal that there are more that 200 million users that write more than 400 million posts every day 3 , talking about a great diversity of topics. As a consequence, several entities such as companies, celebrities, politicians, etc., are very interested in using this type of platform for increasing or even improving their presence among Twitter users, aiming at obtaining good reputation values. As an important effort for providing effective solutions to the above problem, RepLab 4 proposes a competitive evaluation exercise for Online Reputation Management (ORM) systems. As one of the main tasks evaluated in RepLab is the Profiling task. This particular task consists of mining the reputation of a company from online media. Adequate profiling systems must be able to retrieve several posts from several online sources, and annotating them according to their relevancy, i.e., to preserve online documents related to the company and to identify all positive or negative implications for the company contained in such documents <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.44,167.80,10.60,8.97" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>As mention in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,210.00,180.40,10.60,8.97" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, systems that face the profiling task must annotate two different types of information: i) Filtering: This means that an automatic system must be able to decide whether a given tweet is related to a particular company or not. Basically it represents a two class problem since systems must tag a tweet as "related" or "not related"; and, ii) Polarity for Reputation: The idea of this particular subtask is to identify if a given tweet contains positive or negative implications for the company's reputation. This problem represent a three class problem since an automatic system have to assigns a "positive", "negative" or "neutral" tag for each tweet related to a particular company.</p><p>Our proposed approach for facing both filtering and polarity problems is based on distributional term representations (DTRs) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,308.76,300.52,10.60,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which are a way to represent terms by means of contextual information, given by term-co-occurrence statistics. Accordingly, this paper presents the details of the participation of the Language and Reasoning group from UAM-C to the CLEF 2013 RepLab profiling task (i.e., filtering and polarity for reputation). The main objectives of our experiments were: 1. To test if a richer document representation based on term co-occurrences can be successfully applied to filtering and polarity subtasks. 2. To estimate how useful our previously developed methods for sentiment analysis on Twitter can be adopted for detecting positive and negative implications of tweets in the context of the RepLab exercise. 3. To evaluate to what extent supervised techniques are able to solve both filtering and polarity problems.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes all the steps considered in the pre-processing stage. Section 3 describe the proposed representation strategy. Section 4 describes the experimental setup we followed, as well as our results obtained for both filtering and polarity subtasks. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions derived from this work and outlines future work directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Tweets pre-processing</head><p>It is worth mentioning that for performing all our experiments we collected two different versions of the collection of tweets which are described below: Main: For this configuration we crawled only the main tweet from each given tweet id. In other words, all other tweets contained in the original tweet id (e.g., answers or comments generated by the original tweet) are ignored. All: For this configuration, we crawled both the main tweet and all answers or comments generated by the original tweet from each given tweet id.</p><p>When retrieving the All version of the tweets collection, our intuitive idea was to evaluate the impact of all conversational elements of a tweet when deciding its polarity as well as its relevancy. Notice that this crawling procedure was replicated when retrieving test tweets.</p><p>As pre-processing steps we applied the following procedures to each tweet in the two versions of the tweets collection (i.e., Main and All):</p><p>1. All tweets are transform to lowercase. 2. All users mentions (i.e., @user) are replaced by the tag: AT-USER. 3. Every outgoing link is replaced by the tag: OUTGOING-LINK, hence, for performed experiments we did not use the information contained in these links, however we believe they can be useful when trying to detect if a tweet is related or not to a company. 4. All hashtags (i.e., #hashtagX) are replaced by the tag: HASHTAG. 5. All punctuation mark as well as emoticons are deleted. 6. We apply the Porter stemming <ref type="bibr" coords="3,275.16,292.48,10.60,8.97" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. 7. All stopwords are deleted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tweets representation</head><p>Distributional term representations (DTRs) are tools for term representation that rely on term occurrence and co-occurrence statistics <ref type="bibr" coords="3,328.92,369.63,10.60,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Intuitively, the meaning of a term is determined by the context in which it occurs. Where the context is given in terms of other terms in the vocabulary. In this paper we consider one popular DTR, namely termco-occurrence representation. This DTR has been mainly used in term classification and term clustering tasks, and very recently for short-text categorization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,416.76,417.52,10.60,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, where their potential benefits for term expansion are shown.</p><p>The term co-occurrence representation (TCOR) is based on co-occurrence statistics. The underlying idea is that the semantics of a term t j can be revealed by other terms it co-occur with across the document collection. Here, each term t j ∈ T is represented by a vector of weights w j = w 1, j , . . . , w |T |, j , where 0 ≤ w k, j ≤ 1 represents the contribution of term t k to semantic description of t j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,258.00,508.53,222.68,24.31">w k,t = t f f (t k ,t j ) • log |T | T k (1)</formula><p>where T k is the number of different terms in the dictionary T that co-occur with t j in at least one document and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,208.32,572.37,272.36,24.03">t f f (t k ,t j ) = 1 + log(#(t k ,t j )) i f (#(t k ,t j ) &gt; 0) 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>where #(t k ,t j ) denotes the number of documents in which term t j co-occurs with the term t k . The intuition behind this weighting scheme is that the more t k and t j co-occur the more important t k is for describing term t j ; the more terms co-occur with t k the less important is to define the semantics of t j . At the end, the vector of weights is normalized to have unit 2-norm:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,218.52,656.49,45.45,10.63">||w j || 2 = 1.</formula><p>Finally, let w t j denote the DTR of term t j in the vocabulary, where w t j is the TCOR representation. The representation of a document d i based on this DTR is obtained as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,271.44,151.95,209.24,25.39">d dtr i = ∑ t j ∈d i α t j • w t j (3)</formula><p>where α j is a scalar that weights the contribution of term t j ∈ d i into the document representation. Thus, the representation of a document is given by the (weighted) aggregation of the contextual representations of terms appearing in the document. That is, the document representation is a summary of the contextual information present in the terms that appear in the document.</p><p>Under TCOR, a document d i is represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,345.72,244.79,44.04,13.61">d dtr i ∈ R |T |</formula><p>, a vector of the same dimensionality as the vocabulary. The values of d dtr i indicate the association between terms in the vocabulary and those terms that occur in d i . Notice that scalar α t j aims to weight the importance that term t j has for describing document d i . Many options are available for defining α t j , in this work we considered the following weights: Boolean (BOOL), Term-Frequency (TF), and Relative Frequency (TF-IDF).</p><p>Notice that using this type of representations can lead to problems of high dimensionality, since the number of terms (features) usually accomplish that T → ∞. This fact may lead to problems of over-fitting when training a classifier. A technique that has been used as a feature selection strategy is by means of preserving terms near to the transition point pt T <ref type="bibr" coords="4,214.20,367.24,10.79,8.97" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,224.98,367.24,7.19,8.97" target="#b5">6]</ref>. The pt T represents a frequency value that divides vocabulary terms T in two sets, those of low frequency and those of high frequency.</p><p>In a previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="4,227.04,391.72,10.60,8.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, we have shown that by means of preserving high frequency terms in conjunction with a subset of low frequency terms, it is possible to solve (to some extent) the problem of assigning polarity values to twitter posts, especially for a three class problem (i.e., positive, negative and neutral). Accordingly, we defined a subset of experiments for the polarity subtask employing this strategy as features selection technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Results</head><p>For the RepLab 2013 edition participant teams were given a large dataset (61 entities) from four domains: automotive, banking, universities and music/artists. For trial dataset, approximately 700 tweets were provided for each entity. Contrary to the Re-pLab 2012 edition, RepLab 2013 organizers provided as test dataset tweets from the same 61 entities that where used as trial dataset. For these, approximately 1700 tweets were crawled.</p><p>Given this situation, i.e., same entities for training and for testing, we decided to adopt a supervised strategy for solving the problem of filtering and polarity. We report our results for the test dataset in terms of Reliability, Sensibility and their harmonic mean <ref type="bibr" coords="4,152.63,620.68,13.40,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>As we mentioned in Section 1, our goals were to test if by means of employing a richer documents representation (see Section 3) it would be possible to solve both sub tasks involved in the profiling problem. Consequently, we defined as our baseline method the traditional Bag-of-Words (BOW) representation. Finally, it is worth mentioning that we used, for all our experiments; as our main classifier the Weka's<ref type="foot" coords="5,442.68,130.08,3.69,6.64" target="#foot_0">5</ref> Support Vector Machine implementation considering a linear kernel configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Filtering results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,159.72,191.44,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref> describe the configuration assigned to each experiment for performed experiments in terms of type of representation (BOW or TCOR), weighting scheme (BOOL, TF or TF-IDF) and type of tweets collection used (Main or All). Notice that each column, from 2nd to 7th, represent one experiment definition, i.e., one run (6 runs were submitted in total). Table <ref type="table" coords="5,174.96,369.40,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_2">2</ref> show obtained results for filtering subtask. Last two rows indicate: i) the baseline performance as defined in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,271.79,381.40,10.97,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and ii) the average performance of all participant teams in the RepLab 2013 edition. Notice that by means of using a BOW representation with a boolean weighting scheme (run 01, and run 04) allows to obtain the higher accuracy values. This might be an indicator that only by the presence of some words it is possible to decide whether a tweet is related to a company or not.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that our DTR representation (run 03 and run 06) were able to achieve a better performance than the traditional BOW in terms of reliability measure without considerably decreasing the accuracy. Somehow, this results are an indicator of a better precision, which under a real scenario, it might be more important than the sensibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Polarity for reputation results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,159.72,201.52,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_3">3</ref> describe the configuration assigned to each performed experiment for the polarity subtasks, and Table <ref type="table" coords="6,238.32,213.40,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_5">4</ref> show obtained results for our performed experiments in the polarity subtask. Notice that our bets results in terms of reliability and accuracy were obtained by means of using a TCOR representation with a TF-IDF weighting scheme using only the Main version of tweets (i.e., run 02). This represent an interesting result, since indicates that the polarity of a tweet can be determined by considering the context in which the tweet's terms occurs. In general, DTR experiments (run 02, 04 and 06) obtain better reliability performance. It is also important to remark that performed experiments applying a feature selection strategy by means of the t p T (run 05 an 06) are able to obtain acceptable results in terms of sensitivity and F(R,S). We think that performing additional experiments under similar circumstances but using the "Main" version of the tweets collection will allow to obtain better results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future work</head><p>In this paper, we have described the experiments performed by the Language and Reasoning group from UAM-C in the context of the RepLab 2013 evaluation exercise. Our proposed system was designed for addressing the problem of filtering tweets (i.e., determining whether a tweet is related or not to a given entity name) as well as for classifying polarity for reputation, i.e., identifying positive or negative implications contained in the tweet.</p><p>Our proposed system is based on the use of DTRs as form of representation for tweets texts. This type of representations assume that the meaning of a term is determined by the context in which it occurs. Where the context is given in terms of other terms in the vocabulary. Obtained results showed that DTR representation allows to obtain a better performance in terms of the reliability measure, indicating to some extent that this type of representations allow better precision values both in filtering and polarity subtasks.</p><p>Additionally, we also observed that applying the transition point (t p T ) as feature selection strategy allowed our system to obtain good results in terms of the sensibility measure. We believe that this strategy might be useful when employing the "Main" version of the tweets collection.</p><p>As future work we plan to develop a system that considers information contained on the entity's web page, as well as considering all the emoticons and hashtags contained in tweets texts. Additionally, we plan to evaluate some other DTR representations, since obtained results motivate us to keep working on this direction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,175.92,270.00,254.36,28.95"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Configuration for submitted experiments: Filtering subtask.</figDesc><table coords="5,175.92,290.88,78.71,8.07"><row><cell>Configuration/Run ID</cell></row></table></figure>
