<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="1,299.08,501.12,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> aims to develop methods and resources that make electronic medical records (EMRs) more understandable by both patients and health professionals. The challenge spans three tasks. The second task focuses on the resolution of abbreviations into UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs). We present here our participation in the second task and develop a system that can determine the CUI of an abbreviation. We propose a solution that combines a simple feature set with external knowledge gathered from the UMLS Metathesaurus.</p><p>Clinical notes often use abbreviations and acronyms (henceforth collectively named 'abbreviations' in this paper). While the number and variety of abbreviations is unlimited thanks to the plasticity of language and the inventiveness of the human mind, the distribution of abbreviations can be expected to follow a Zipfian law, with a small number of distinct abbreviations accounting for a large part of the total number of occurrences of abbreviations. We therefore hypothesize that the sample of abbreviations present in the training corpus provided by CLEF-eHEALTH for the task should contain most frequently occurring abbreviations and should hence account for a large part of the occurrences of abbreviations in the test corpus.</p><p>We present a supervised abbreviation resolution system specifically adapted to the abbreviations of the CLEF eHealth corpus. Our system learns a MaxEnt model from the training data, based on a simple feature set that combines UMLS knowledge with information gathered from the EMR text. We present the system design, its results on the 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.91,215.63,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> test data, and discuss its merits and limitations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Abbreviations and acronyms are pervasive in technical and scientific text, including in health and life sciences. They create obstacles to various information extraction tasks, for instance for coreference resolution in electronic medical records <ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.29,317.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This has motivated work on abbreviation detection and expansion on various types of texts, the most prevalent of which for health are the scientific literature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.83,341.16,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,212.00,341.16,7.75,8.74" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.41,341.16,7.75,8.74" target="#b0">1]</ref> and patient records <ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.03,341.16,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,340.19,341.16,7.01,8.74" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Initial work aimed to collect acronyms and their expansions from large corpora <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.59,353.11,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.77,353.11,7.01,8.74" target="#b7">8]</ref>, in expressions such as the numbers of underrepresented minorities (URMs) 1 where the expansion of an abbreviation is directly provided in the input text. This is however not always the case, and is even fairly rare in patient records.</p><p>When abbreviation expansions are not explicit in source texts, abbreviation processing can be divided into two steps. The first is the detection of abbreviations, which determines which expressions in a text are abbreviations (or acronyms) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,183.40,436.80,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This can be compared to an entity detection task. The second step is the resolution of abbreviations: given an expression, which may map to multiple expansions, select the appropriate expansion in context. If all possible expansions are available, this is similar to a disambiguation task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.10,472.66,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Kim et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.08,484.62,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> disambiguate abbreviations with a multi-class SVM classifier trained on feature vectors including the five preceding and following words (occurring at least five times in the corpus). They train on a corpus of 9,963 clinical notes in which full forms have automatically been replaced with abbreviations, following Pakhomov <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.50,532.44,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, using the inventory of abbreviations in the UMLS Specialist Lexicon file LRABR. They test their method on a corpus of 37 hand-annotated clinical notes and achieve an F-measure of 0.660 (Precision = 0.683, Recall = 0.637) in exact match and 0.754 in partial match.</p><p>Task 2 of the ShARe CLEF eHealth 2013 Challenge addresses the abbreviation disambiguation step. Gold standard annotations of abbreviation boundaries are given for the abbreviations present in clinical notes, which removes the need to address the abbreviation detection step: the task consists of disambiguating and normalizing each abbreviation into a UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI), or the CUI-less label if no UMLS CUI is available. It is close to the task defined in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,181.53,131.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but it is to our knowledge the first time a dataset of this size is provided to address abbreviation disambiguation in clinical notes into a reference terminology. Besides, a rapid examination of the abbreviations found in the training dataset shows that a number of them are not present in the Specialist Lexicon LRABR file: for instance, oxygen saturation abbreviated as O2 sat or 02 sat (this latter example uses a zero instead of the letter 'O') is not listed among the 4 abbreviations of oxygen saturation in LRABR (O2 saturation, O2sat, SO2, SpO2 ), so the semi-supervised method of <ref type="bibr" coords="3,318.09,215.63,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,330.26,215.63,7.75,8.74" target="#b2">3]</ref> might not apply here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data</head><p>The corpus used for the 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH challenge consists of de-identified plain text EMRs from the MIMIC II database, version 2.5 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,392.81,292.81,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The EMR documents were extracted from the intensive-care unit setting and included discharge summaries, electrocardiography reports, echography reports, and radiology reports. The training set contained 200 documents and a total of 94,243 words, while the test set contained 100 documents and a total of 87,799 words (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,162.16,352.58,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Abbreviations and acronyms are annotated in terms of span and UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) when available. If no CUI is available for the abbreviation the CUI-less code is used. The training set contained 3, 805 annotations, while the test set contained 3, 774 annotations (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,389.48,400.40,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). CUI-less abbreviations accounted for about 5% in the training set and 6% in the test set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">System design</head><p>Document headers (see details below) contain pre-formatted fields, some of which contain abbreviations. Since these are very regular fields, their CUIs are not ambiguous, and simple rules can handle them. We therefore divided the problem into two parts:</p><p>-Rule-based resolution of abbreviations in document headers (Section 3.4); -Supervised resolution of abbreviations in document body (Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Supervised resolution of abbreviations in document body</head><p>We used a supervised linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF) system which we restricted to Maximum Entropy mode (see below). We trained a model using 10-fold cross validation on the training set data, keeping 1/11th of the data for final tuning of the model. We first present how we formulate the problem.</p><p>We then describe the pre-processing steps we performed on the datasets and the model feature set together with the CRF feature patterns. When all candidate CUIs for an abbreviation are known, abbreviation expansion can be addressed as a supervised classification task-this is what we do here. We label each abbreviation of the training set with its gold standard CUI, using a B-I-O scheme where each CUI introduces a B-and possibly some I-labels. For instance, the two tokens of abbreviation "O2 sat" are labelled as B-C0523807 and I-C0523807. This results in 738 distinct labels. An obvious limitation of this design is that only those CUIs seen in the training set can be assigned in the test set, but we found it worth trying. We used the Wapiti <ref type="bibr" coords="4,237.49,418.45,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> <ref type="foot" coords="4,248.00,416.87,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">2</ref> implementation of CRFs because it is fast and offers convenient patterns (e.g., patterns using regular expressions on field values).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problem formulation</head><p>Data pre-processing Our data pre-processing and feature production architecture is schematized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,272.74,476.22,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Before using the challenge corpora for training and testing, we performed the following pre-processing steps:</p><p>the training and test corpora provided by the challenge organizers were deidentified and thus contained special de-identification marks; to turn deidentification code into more normal phrases, we performed re-identification with pseudonyms on the input text. -EMR documents present in general a well-structured form, with a header, document body, and a footer. The header and footer contain information relevant to clinical administration, but the disorder NPs are only encountered inside the document body. We thus removed the header and footer from the EMR documents and performed analysis on the document body only. Since headers may contain abbreviations, we handled them specifically (see below). System features Given a sentence s = . . . w -2 w -1 w 0 w 1 w 2 . . . and a token of interest w k , we define features over w k and n-grams centered at w k .</p><p>1. Lexical and morphological features: we include information on the token in the form of unigrams over w k-1 , w k , w k+1 and bigrams over w k-1 w k .</p><p>Additionally we include as unigram features over w k token prefixes ranging from 1 to 4 characters. We also add a 5-gram feature which detects patterns containing two slashes, such as "m/r/g", which may help disambiguate between disorders and abbreviations, and apply it over w k-4 , w k-2 , w k (the non-slash positions of the pattern). 2. Document structure features: the feature set contains as features the document type (e.g., radiology report, discharge summary) and the section type (e.g., Findings, Laboratory data, Social History). We extract the section type using a rule-based section extraction tool that identifies the occurrence of section names within the EMR. The section extraction tool uses a list of 58 manually defined section names. Both document type and section type are unigram features over w k . 3. UMLS features: we include UMLS information from two sources. We first run cTAKES over the texts and keep concept unique identifiers (CUIs, defined over unigrams w k ). We use an additional UMLS mapping where we directly search for UMLS strings within the EMR text through exact match and include the concept unique identifier (CUI) of the identified phrase. The direct UMLS mapping features are unigram features over w k . 4. Abbreviation feature: gold standard boundaries for abbreviations are provided. These are used as unigram features over w k .</p><p>All features pertaining to multi-token expressions instead of only single tokens (for instance, being a UMLS term with a given CUI, or being an abbreviation) are encoded with the Begin Inside Outside (B-I-O) scheme: given a label L, the first token is labeled B-L, the next tokens are labeled I-L, and tokens not having this feature are labeled O. An advantage of linear-chain CRFs is that they can include label bigrams in the model they learn. However, in our experiments on the training set, we were not able to use label bigrams because of the large number of labels (738 in the model we finally used): with label bigrams, the number of generated features for a CRF pattern which involves x observed values and y labels is x × y 2 , and it seems that the feature space generated when we tested with these label bigrams was to vast for the CRF to find a solution when training. Having no label bigrams means that our CRF is used basically as a Maximum Entropy classifier, with no dependency on the previous label. The total number of features generated for evaluation by the CRF for this model is about 50 million, among which it selects about 400,000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Rule-based resolution of abbreviations in document headers</head><p>We examined abbreviations in the training set headers and wrote rules to label them. These rules are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,294.88,272.90,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. They handle the 6 abbreviations found in the document headers of the training set. The resulting annotations are merged with those obtained by the CRF. 4 Results and discussion</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation metrics</head><p>We evaluate the system's ability to correctly generate the codes (CUIs or CUIless) of abbreviations. The evaluation measure is the accuracy of codes, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,264.25,535.69,216.34,22.31">Accuracy = Correct Total<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Correct= Number of pre-annotated acronyms/abbreviations with correctly generated code; Total = Number of pre-annotated acronyms/abbreviations. In some cases the human annotators generated a ranked list of codes for a given abbreviation. This makes it possible to define two variants of the accuracy score. In the strict variant, only the top code selected by the annotators (one best) is considered. In the relaxed variant, a code is considered correct if it is contained in the full list generated by the annotators (n-best).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Rule-based resolution of abbreviations in headers</head><p>Rule-based resolution of abbreviations in headers obtained the results displayed on Table <ref type="table" coords="7,177.18,151.76,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. 109 abbreviations were located in the headers; the rules identified 100, out of which 97 matched the gold standard. The two substitutions (the gold standard CUI was different from that proposed by the system) are both cases where human annotators marked as CUI-less an M (Male) or F (Female) abbreviation in the header, which seems to be an error in the gold standard. <ref type="foot" coords="7,436.61,398.14,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">3</ref> Since we did not constrain rules to apply to gold standard abbreviation boundaries, the system also identified an M abbreviation which the human annotators forgot to mark in a document header (insertion). <ref type="foot" coords="7,307.74,434.01,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">4</ref> If this is correct, rule-based resolution of abbreviations had perfect accuracy. However, the headers were processed only through these rules, and other abbreviations in the headers were thus not examined. 10 such abbreviations were missed (deletions), so that overall, our resolution of abbreviations in headers achieved an accuracy of 0.89 against the gold standard. All in all, the hundred of abbreviations present in headers are only a small part of the 3,774 abbreviations of the test corpus (about 3%), so this part of the method only contributed a small fraction of the performance of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Resolution of abbreviations in full documents</head><p>This section presents the global results that we obtained on the full documents, merging codes obtained through rule-based and supervised methods. We submitted one run which achieved an accuracy of 0.664 under the strict evaluation and 0.672 under the relaxed setting.</p><p>The training set contained 696 distinct CUIs (plus the CUI-less label), whereas the test set contained 706 distinct CUIs (plus CUI-less) (see Table <ref type="table" coords="8,439.04,131.95,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). When training our final CRF model we kept 1/11th of the corpus for development, resulting in a model which has knowledge for 654 CUIs (plus CUI-less). Only 346 of these were present in the test set, which means that our system could only identify about one half of the 706 distinct CUIs of the test set.</p><p>However, considering the number of occurrences of these CUIs draws a quite different picture. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,234.83,203.68,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows that among the 3774 occurrences of abbreviations contained in the test set, 2906 had CUIs seen in the training corpus (including 221 occurrences of CUI-less, see Table <ref type="table" coords="8,298.21,227.59,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). Correctly identifying these known CUIs would have led to an accuracy of 2906/3774 = 0.770, which would outperform the best system of the challenge (0.719). Our hypothesis according to which considering only the abbreviations of the training corpus could be sufficient to provide a strong baseline is therefore confirmed. Besides, our system correctly identified the CUIs of 2354 occurrences of abbreviations, i.e., 81% of the best it could have done given its inherent limitations. In the case of unseen abbreviations, our system can only be right if the abbreviation is CUI-less and the system does assign this code to it; this occurred for 151 occurrences. Whether or not an abbreviation had a CUI did not affect much the performance of the system, as can be seen on Table <ref type="table" coords="8,380.23,490.54,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. We conclude this discussion with a word on insertions and deletions. These were not expected given the task definition: given gold standard abbreviation boundaries, determine the CUI of the abbreviation. Using a CRF with a B-I-O scheme allowed us to keep the very same framework as we prepared for Task 1 of the challenge, Entity Recognition <ref type="bibr" coords="9,293.60,131.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Its drawback is that without additional constraints, it decides where to set the boundaries of the CUI or CUI-less codes that it assigns to its input tokens. When this created boundary changes, they caused a mismatch between the gold standard and system abbreviations, which can be counted as a deletion (missing gold standard abbreviation) combined to an insertion (spurious system abbreviation).</p><p>For instance, the gold standard considered the string NCAT as two tokens NC A split into multiple tokens occurred more frequently than the reverse situation, which explains why insertions (285) are more numerous than deletions (163). Since the gold standard boundaries are given, a post-processing step could be added in the future to predict a code for the actual abbreviation span based on the CRF output. The cleanest way to cope with this issue though will be to rewrite the system to quit the linear-chain framework of our Task 1 system and switch to a standard Maximum Entropy (or other) classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>We present an abbreviation resolution system prepared for participation in Task 2 of the 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH challenge. We design our system as a derivation of our Task 1 framework into a supervised Maximum Entropy classifier with lexical, document structure, and UMLS features, complemented by rule-based processing of abbreviations in document headers. Our system obtains an accuracy of 0.664 (strict) and 0.672 (relaxed), which gives it a second position among five systems. We have tested the bold hypothesis that relying only on the CUIs seen in the training set is enough to provide a strong baseline. The data in the test set and the obtained results show that this hypothesis holds. We have seen that in principle this framework might even fare better than the current best challenge participant. Further work can go into two directions. One is to keep the current framework and strengthen it, for instance by removing deletions and insertions, and by studying the current causes of substitutions. The other is to move to dynamic generation of candidate expansions. This may require to abandon the neat supervised classification framework which was possible here, but is needed to extend processing to abbreviations unseen in the training set or in existing databases such as the UMLS Specialist Lexicon LRABR.</p></div>

Its drawback is that without additional constraints, it decides where to set the boundaries of the CUI or CUI-less codes that it assigns to its input tokens. When this created boundary changes, they caused a mismatch between the gold standard and system abbreviations, which can be counted as a deletion (missing gold standard abbreviation) combined to an insertion (spurious system abbreviation).For instance, the gold standard considered the string NCAT as two tokens NC [CUI-less] AT [CUI-less] while the system tagged it as one token: NCAT [CUI-less]. Conversely, the system tagged 02 sat [C0523807] as two tokens 02 [C0030054] sat [C0523807], and tagged LE's [C0023216] as three tokens LE [C0023216] ' [C1444662] s [C0023901].A split into multiple tokens occurred more frequently than the reverse situation, which explains why insertions (285) are more numerous than deletions (163). Since the gold standard boundaries are given, a post-processing step could be added in the future to predict a code for the actual abbreviation span based on the CRF output. The cleanest way to cope with this issue though will be to rewrite the system to quit the linear-chain framework of our Task 1 system and switch to a standard Maximum Entropy (or other) classifier.</figDesc></figure>
