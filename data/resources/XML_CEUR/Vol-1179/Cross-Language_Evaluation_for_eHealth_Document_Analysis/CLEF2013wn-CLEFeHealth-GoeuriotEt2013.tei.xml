<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The goal of the ShARe/CLEF (Cross-Language Evaluation Forum) eHealth Evaluation Lab is to evaluate systems that support laypeople in searching for and understanding their health information <ref type="bibr" coords="1,332.37,566.93,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It comprises three tasks. The specific use case considered is as follows: before leaving the hospital, a patient receives a discharge summary. This describes the diagnosis and the treatment that they received in the hospital. The first task considered in CLEF eHealth aims at extracting names of disorders from the discharge summaries, while the second task requires normalisation and expansion of abbreviations and acronyms</p><p>In alphabetical order, LG, GJFJ, LK &amp; JL led Task 3; AH, HM, SS, HS &amp; GZ were on the Task 3 organising committee.</p><p>present in the discharge summaries. The use case then postulates that, given the discharge summaries and the diagnosed disorders, patients often have questions regarding their health condition. The goal of the third task is to provide valuable and relevant documents to patients, so as to satisfy their health-related information needs. To evaluate systems that tackle this third task, we provide potential patient queries and a document collection containing various health and biomedical documents for task participants to create their search system. As is common in evaluation of information retrieval (IR), the test collection consists of documents, queries, and corresponding relevance judgements.</p><p>Searching for health advice is a common and important task performed by individuals on the web. Nearly 70% of search engine users in the US have conducted a web search for information about a specific disease or health problem <ref type="bibr" coords="2,467.31,271.14,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. While health IR is often considered as a domain-specific task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.78,283.09,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it is performed by a large variety of users, including various healthcare workers, but also, and increasingly commonly, by laypeople (e.g., patients and their relatives). This variety of potential information seekers, each characterised by different health knowledge, implies a broad range of information needs, and consequently a requirement for retrieval systems able to satisfy the health information needs of different categories of users.</p><p>The growing importance of health IR has provided the motivation for a number of evaluation campaigns focusing on health information. For example, the TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) Medical Records Tracks aim at identifying patient cohorts from medical reports to recruit for user studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,411.46,422.28,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this task, topics include a particular disease/condition set and a particular treatment/intervention set; demographics or other characteristics may also be part of the topics (e.g., age group and hospitalisation status). Moreover, the ImageCLEFmed tracks of the CLEF Initiative (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, formerly known as Cross-Language Evaluation Forum) have created resources for the evaluation of image search in online resources or biomedical journal articles <ref type="bibr" coords="2,160.42,505.97,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.60,505.97,7.01,8.74" target="#b5">6]</ref>. However, while addressing different information needs (e.g., finding similar clinical cases vs. journal papers), these previous campaigns have targeted specific groups of users with expert health knowledge (e.g., clinicians and health researchers). The ShARe/CLEF eHealth Task 3 resembles other ad-hoc information retrieval tasks but with a focus on the information needs of laypeople and the types of queries they pose to express these needs.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the main evaluation campaigns on health IR. Section 3 describes the creation of the CLEF eHealth dataset, that is, the document collection, query generation, and relevance assessment. Section 4 presents the result sets and their evaluation and Section 5 the approaches used by task participants. Finally Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Previous research has considered the information needs of individuals seeking health advice on the web, but these studies mainly analysed query logs from large commercial search engines <ref type="bibr" coords="3,275.41,174.85,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, no evaluation campaign has considered the information needs that patients may have regarding their health conditions and provided resources for evaluating IR systems for this task. Such lack of attention to this task arises, at least partially, due to the complexity of assessing the information needs: laypeople that search for health information on the web have very varied profiles, and their queries and searching time tend to be much shorter than those considered in past health IR benchmarks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,189.92,258.53,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,202.10,258.53,7.01,8.74" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>OHSUMED, published in 1994, was the first collection containing medical data used for IR evaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,261.20,283.85,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The collection contained around 350,000 abstracts from medical journals on the MEDLINE database over a period of five years <ref type="bibr" coords="3,161.86,307.76,23.90,8.74">(1987)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.76,307.76,4.78,8.74">(1988)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.76,307.76,4.78,8.74">(1989)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.76,307.76,4.78,8.74">(1990)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.54,307.76,23.90,8.74">(1991)</ref> and two sets of topics: 63 topics manually generated and around 5,000 topics based on the controlled vocabulary thesaurus of the Medical Subject Headings<ref type="foot" coords="3,224.93,330.10,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">7</ref> (concept name and definition). The collection was created for the TREC 2000 Filtering Track but also used for other research on health IR <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.01,355.58,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.18,355.58,11.62,8.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>The TREC Medical Records Track ran in 2011 and 2012 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,397.13,368.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. It was based on a collection of de-identified medical records (93,551 medical reports mapped into 17,264 visits) and queries (35 queries in 2011 and 50 in 2012) that resembled eligibility criteria of clinical studies. Records were grouped into visits, corresponding to a patient admission in the hospital; visits ranged in length from a few hours to in excess of a year. The goal of the track was to find patient cohorts that are relevant to the criteria for recruitment as populations in comparative effectiveness studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task Description</head><p>The data set provided to participants comprises a document collection of around one million documents (web pages from medical web sites), 50 topics, which were developed by medical experts, and the corresponding relevance information <ref type="bibr" coords="3,462.33,546.41,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In addition to TREC-style title and description fields, the topics contain an additional field discharge-summary, which contains the discharge report which the patient's query stemmed from.</p><p>The data was provided to participants after signing an agreement, through the PhysioNet website. As test data, five training topics together with corresponding relevance assessment were released.</p><p>We describe in this section each part of the task dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Document Collection</head><p>A large web crawl of health resources is used as the corpus for this task. The crawl contains about one million documents, which have been made available to CLEF eHealth through the Khresmoi project <ref type="bibr" coords="4,347.37,164.41,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This collection consists of web pages covering a broad range of health topics, targeted at both the general public and healthcare professionals. These domains consist predominantly of health and medicine websites that have been certified by the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation<ref type="foot" coords="4,219.31,210.66,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">8</ref> as adhering to the HONcode principles <ref type="foot" coords="4,405.24,210.66,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">9</ref> (approximately 60-70% of the collection), as well as other commonly used health and medicine websites such as Drugbank<ref type="foot" coords="4,256.77,234.57,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_3">10</ref> , Diagnosia <ref type="foot" coords="4,315.44,234.57,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_4">11</ref> and Trip Answers <ref type="foot" coords="4,409.41,234.57,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_5">12</ref> . The crawled documents are provided in the dataset in their raw HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) format along with their uniform resource locators (URL). The dataset is made available for download on the web to registered participants on a secure password-protected server.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Discharge Summaries</head><p>Novel methods to generate contextualised statements of patient information needs were used. These are based on realistic short query statements created in the context of patient discharge summaries. The discharge summaries can be considered as a description of the context in which the patient has been diagnosed with a given disorder and has written a query. The discharge summaries originate from the de-identified MIMIC-II database <ref type="foot" coords="4,362.82,393.15,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_6">13</ref> (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care, Version 2.5). Discharge summaries are semi-structured reports with the following appearance: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Topics</head><p>The queries used in the task aim to model those used by laypeople (i.e., patients, their relatives or other representatives) to find out more about their disorders, once they have examined a discharge summary. Disorders have been identified within discharge summaries and linked to the matching UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) concept in the CLEF eHealth Task 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,382.56,314.98,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Previous evaluation tasks in health IR have used MeSH entries (the MeSH ontology is contained in the UMLS meta-ontology) as queries (see Section 2). However, the queries considered by the task presented here are intended to be representative of real patients' information needs and statements. Thus the possibility of issuing concept-queries is discarded. Layperson queries tend to be short, with an average length less than two words. However, different patients can have different information needs associated with the same query statement. For example, a patient that receives a cancer diagnosis for the first time would have a different information need than a patient at a terminal cancer stage. This type of contextual information related to the patient history is contained in the discharge summary. Thus, the discharge summaries can be used for contextually focused generation of queries. The information in a discharge summary can then be used to determine the relevance of retrieved information to the specific user.</p><p>A query is generated for a given disorder and a discharge summary. To better structure the query generation process, patients' information needs have been grouped into three main scenarios:</p><p>1. the patient has a short-term disease, or has been hospitalised after an accident (little to no knowledge of the disorder, short-term treatment), 2. the patient has a chronic disease or a long-term disease that has just been diagnosed (little to no knowledge of the disorder, long-term treatment), and 3. the patient has a chronic or long-term disease, and this is the n-th diagnosis (potentially good knowledge of the disorder, long-term treatment).</p><p>Queries to be used in this task have been created by experts (each expert was a registered nurse and clinical documentation researcher) involved in the CLEF eHealth consortium. This solution has been chosen in place of recruiting patients because of the issues involved with recruitment and privacy. We believe that, being on a daily basis in contact with patients receiving treatments and discharge summaries, nurses are familiar with patients' information needs and patient profiles.</p><p>65 disorders have been randomly selected from the set of 1,006 disorders identified in the CLEF eHealth Task 1. For each disorder, a discharge summary containing the disorder itself has been randomly selected. Using the pairs of disorder and associated discharge summary, the experts have developed a set of patient queries (and criteria for judging the relevance of documents to the queries, for use in the relevance assessment task described in the next section). Queries are provided in a standard TREC format, consisting of a topic title (text of the query), description (longer description of what the query means), and a narrative (expected content of the relevant documents).</p><p>The following example outlines a query: With this approach, five training and fifty test queries have been generated for use in the task. 65 disorders have been selected (i.e. more than the targeted number of queries) because some disorders/queries may not be answerable using web pages from the document collection. During the query generation process, the experts manually removed disorders from the list of 65 that do not allow for realistic query generation. A real log containing queries issued by the general public on the HON website has also been used to exclude candidate queries which are unrealistic of the type of query that a patient would typically enter. For each query, an IR system that implements a standard BM25 weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="6,465.09,499.51,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has been used to retrieve a shallow pool of documents. This has been used to assess whether a standard retrieval system could match at least one relevant document to a candidate query. Queries with no relevant documents retrieved in the shallow pool have been removed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,133.79,267.36,57.72,14.09">&lt;query&gt; &lt; t i t l e &gt; t h</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Relevance Assessment</head><p>Relevance assessment has been performed by domain experts and IR experts. We used the Relevation system <ref type="foot" coords="6,253.76,611.08,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_7">14</ref> for collecting relevance assessments of documents contained in the assessment pools. Relevation is a system for performing relevance judgements for Information Retrieval system evaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="6,410.12,636.56,14.61,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Documents and queries can be uploaded to the system via the web interface; relevance judges can browse the uploaded documents and queries and provide their relevance assessments. The system is open source and based on Python's Django web framework. Relevation used a simple Model-View-Controller model that is designed for easy customisation and extension.</p><p>As we received many run submissions, we had to limit the pool depth and distributed the relevance assessment workload between medical experts and IR experts. The relevance assessment for these test queries has been conducted by six Finnish nursing professionals and five Australian nursing professionals or students in health sciences (domain experts), and three Irish, one Australian, and one Swedish senior researcher in clinical NLP (Natural Language Processing) and ML (Machine Learning), all technological experts. Each document was assessed by one person.</p><p>We pooled the top ten documents obtained from the participants' baseline runs, and both their top-priority run using discharge summaries and their toppriority run not using discharge summaries. This resulted in a pool of 6,391 documents. The relevance assessment was based on a four point scale, which is mapped to a binary scale. The graded relevance assessment yielded 0: 4,316, 1: 197, 2: 1,439, 3: 439 documents. The binary relevance assessments yielded 0: 4,513 non-relevant and 1: 1,878 relevant documents.</p><p>Thus, there have been 37.56 relevant documents per topic on average and 127.82 documents assessed per topic. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,332.59,374.57,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the relevance assessment coverage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Metrics</head><p>We examined all documents in runs 1, 2 and 5 up to rank 10 for relevance. The two major evaluation metrics are therefore metrics at a cut-off of up to 10 documents, i.e. P@5, P@10, NDCG@5, and NDCG@10. In addition, we considered MAP as an evaluation metric, but we are aware that MAP is unreliable because only the top ten documents have been assessed. Nevertheless, we wanted to report a measure covering the full set of up to 1000 retrieved documents. We also report the number of relevant and retrieved documents in the top 1000 results as a more recall-oriented measure. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,318.22,645.16,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">1</ref> provides details on the coverage of assessments for each run up to rank 10.</p><p>Performance metrics are computed with the standard trec eval tool 15 using the following options:</p><p>-trec eval -c -M1000 -trec eval -c -M1000 -m ndcg cut We are aware that the performance metrics for other runs might be unreliable compared to that of runs 1, 2, and 5. However, this situation is common for IR lab evaluations, where additional experiments on an existing data set typically do not include re-assessment of documents previously not retrieved or relevance assessment of additional documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Baseline System</head><p>For comparison, we created our own baseline experiment, which is based on the BM25 retrieval model. This experiment does not incorporate any domain-specific adaptations. We used the JSoup library 16 to extract the textual content from the web pages and applied standard normalization (e.g. replacing named HTML characters) and spelling correction based on a fixed list of frequent spelling errors. This approach has been employed before for experiments on medical records retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="9,173.84,343.47,15.50,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and was shown to represent a very strong baseline.</p><p>This baseline system uses the BM25 retrieval model and standard blind relevance feedback for BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="9,252.40,367.38,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The system uses a standard stop-word list containing the Okapi stop-words (222 stop-words) for stop-word removal.</p><p>The baseline system performs only two types of document preprocessing: character normalization (i.e. mapping characters with diacritical marks to the equivalent characters without) and word normalization (e.g. correcting frequent spelling errors). Spelling correction is based on a list of 9533 spelling errors from medical documents <ref type="bibr" coords="9,219.43,439.11,14.61,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which was added to a list of 4192 frequent spelling errors compiled from Wikipedia. During indexing, misspelled words are replaced with their corrections from this list.</p><p>We generated two baseline experiments: one with standard retrieval using the BM25 model (BM25 baseline) and a second experiment using blind relevance feedback (BM25 FB baseline). For blind relevance feedback, the top T terms from the top ranked D documents are added to the query to retrieve the final result set of documents. For our baseline experiments, we used T = 10 and D = 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Evaluation Results</head><p>The official results for all submitted runs and for our baseline experiments are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,204.01,592.23,3.87,8.74">3</ref>.</p><p>Comparing the participants' results wrt. P@10 and NDCG@10, we found that for 4 teams (ohsu, THCIB, teamAEHRC, uog) run 5 (using discharge summaries) achieves the best P@10, while for 2 teams (QUT-TOPSIG, TeamMayo), 15 http://trec.nist.gov/trec eval/ 16 http://jsoup.org/ Table <ref type="table" coords="10,164.23,117.41,4.13,7.89">3</ref>.

For 3 teams (TeamKC, MEDINFO, UTHealth), the baseline runs (run 1) performs best. Only 4 runs (from the same group) outperform our baseline experiment using standard blind relevance feedback wrt. P@10. Runs from two groups outperform the baseline experiment wrt. NDCG@10. This illustrates that our baseline system based on BM25 is a very strong baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Approaches Used</head><p>We describe in this section the approaches used by each team, and summarize findings from their analysis.</p><p>Team THCIB <ref type="bibr" coords="11,202.35,279.21,15.50,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> implemented ad hoc retrieval using Lucene for indexing and retrieval and HITS for ranking. They submitted 7 runs. They investigated query annotations with UMLS, and the use of various fields of the queries. They also used query expansion based on the concepts and/or the discharge summaries, as well as concept-based re-ranking. Their best run scores 0.42 P@10 (run 5), and uses their baseline with query expansion without the discharge summaries on the title and desc topic fields.</p><p>Team TOPSIG <ref type="bibr" coords="11,206.19,377.28,15.50,8.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> used the TopSig open source tool, which implements signaturebased approaches for information retrieval. Six runs were submitted, using various parts of the topic files as queries, and using the text of the discharge reports for query refinement. Submissions used TopSig normally for query-only runs and with a new 'refine' mode for discharge summary runs. This means the query is used for searching the collection and the results are then re-ranked using the discharge summaries, similarly to how blind feedback works. This produced much better results than simply using the discharge summaries in the original query (P@10 of 0.36), which tend to be too noisy to produce effective results.</p><p>Team AEHRC <ref type="bibr" coords="11,206.61,499.26,15.50,8.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref> used a Dirichlet-smoothed language modelling as provided by the Terrier system for retrieval. They experimented with setting prior probabilities depending on document readability and authorativeness information derived from a static list of web sites. They also explored spelling correction (using Google) and acronym expansion. They submitted 4 runs, and did not use the discharge summaries. Their best result (P@10 of 0.48) is obtained with the baseline and the acronym expansion and spelling correction in the query.</p><p>Team KC <ref type="bibr" coords="11,183.19,597.34,15.50,8.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref> approach is based on statistical topic models. Their baseline used Language models for retrieval, with Indri index engine. They submitted 6 runs, exploring query expansion through the extraction and selection of noun phrases from documents and discharge summaries, using probabilistic topic modelling and language models. They scored their best result (P@10 of 0.40) with the baseline.</p><p>Team Mayo <ref type="bibr" coords="12,194.67,119.99,15.50,8.74" target="#b23">[24]</ref> used a Query-Likelihood Model as their baseline, and further runs using a Markov Random Field Model. Query expansion was carried out using a Mixture of Relevance Models and using the MeSH ontology. They also investigated concept-based re-ranking using medical concepts identified in the discharge summaries, and weighting concepts using attributes such as negation or semantic groups. Their run # 2 got the best results (P@10 of 0.52), using a Markov random field to model the dependency between query terms, expansion of query terms through 4 medical/genomics collections and a concept-space search ranking (based on query and discharge summary).</p><p>Team SNUMEDINFO <ref type="bibr" coords="12,240.67,242.18,15.50,8.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref> used unigram language model with Dirichlet prior smoothing on indri search engine as a baseline. Their runs without discharge summaries are using passage based language model, combining max-scoring passage-based relevance score with unigram language model score, with different weighting parameters. The following runs used lexical query expansion with UMLS concepts and preferred terms. They also explored the use of different fields of the query. Their best results are obtained with the baseline (P@10 of 0.48).</p><p>Team OHSU <ref type="bibr" coords="12,196.91,352.42,15.50,8.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref> submission included runs from two different retrieval systems. One set used the Lucene Vector Space Retrieval model and extensions which made use of MetaMap for query expansion. The second used novel statistical language modelling techniques. Valuable insights for future system improvement were gained, such as insights into selective indexing due to the large amount of noise in web page content, and the need for sophisticated query parsing and expansion techniques. They obtained best results with run #5, using a language model to attempt to find the documents whose word distributions would have been most likely to generate the query, together with an adaptive perplexity threshold.</p><p>Team UThealth <ref type="bibr" coords="12,212.43,486.57,15.50,8.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref> submission contained runs using the vector space model and the semantic vector space model. Best performance was obtained using the vector space model. They also explored the use of different fields of the topics as queries. Their best result was obtained with the baseline (P@10 of 0.37).</p><p>Team UOG <ref type="bibr" coords="12,194.29,548.99,15.50,8.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref> used the Terrier information retrieval framework. Divergence from Randomness and pseudo relevance feedback were employed on the retrieval of medical web pages. They also investigated query expansion using corpus of MEDLINE abstracts or Wikipedia collection. Their best run (P@10 of 0.44) used the baseline system and pseudo relevance feedback.</p><p>The best result overall was obtained by team Mayo, using a retrieval model and external resources for query expansion, as well as re-ranking based on concepts from the query and the discharge summary. However, this team, together with Topsig, are the only teams having improved their baseline with the use of the discharge summaries, and in both cases for re-ranking purposes.</p><p>Concept re-ranking has also been used by team THCIB and given their best results. For five teams, the best scores are obtained with their baseline (coupled with pre-processing such as acronym expansion and spelling correction for team AEHRC). Combination of methods and external resources such as those employed by team Mayo seem to be efficient, but the overall results here show that research still needs to be conducted to make the best out of the external resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this first year of the ShARe/CLEF eHealth2013 evaluation lab Task 3, there was strong take-up in the community with 9 groups submitting runs to the task. The challenge of developing retrieval techniques for layperson medical queries proved difficult. Overall, BM25 is a very strong baseline, which proved hard for teams to beat. BM25 with relevance feedback, as opposed to standard BM25, proved to be the strongest baseline. Here P@10 of 0.4860 was obtained, and NDCG@10 of 0.4328. One team, Mayo, had four runs which performed better than BM25 for P@10. P@10 achieved for these runs ranged from 0.5180 -0.4880. Of these runs, the best performing used information in the discharge summaries. The only other team that improved over the BM25 baseline was SNUBME for their baseline run, where NDCG@10 of 0.4377 was achieved.</p><p>Despite the results obtained being mostly lower than the baseline in this first year of the task, many valuable insights into retrieval technique development for the domain were gained. This forms a good basis for future exploration in the domain in general, and specifically for further technique development for the 2014 CLEF eHealth Task 3 lab.</p><p>Given the success of this year 1 of the task, we anticipate even more interest in next year's campaign. In the second year of the task, we will seek to remove noise from the document collection. This year, as task participants were informed, there were some non-English web pages in the collection and duplicate web pages. That is there were occurrences in the document collection of the same web page, with the same URL but different unique identifier. On top of this, we also identified several occurrences of the same web pages with different URL prefixes. This occurs for example, when a dropdown menu is expanded. We will also explore the possibility of removing or highlighting such duplication in the collection. In next year's campaign we also intend exploring new query generation techniques and means to improve the relevance assessment workflow. In query generation for example, we will look at using the main disease in the discharge summary the query (information need) stems from instead of using a randomly selected disease from within the discharge summary. The goal here being to increase the relevance of using discharge summaries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,135.45,441.40,155.99,6.12;4,135.66,449.37,69.33,6.12;4,221.13,449.37,75.07,6.12;4,135.25,457.34,151.42,6.12;4,135.31,465.31,17.26,6.12;4,167.93,465.31,5.14,6.12;4,135.86,473.28,109.13,6.12;4,136.06,481.25,45.11,6.12;4,140.48,489.22,255.86,6.12;4,135.55,505.16,160.35,6.12;4,135.68,513.13,126.95,6.12;4,135.29,521.10,174.55,6.12;4,140.17,529.07,145.99,6.12;4,135.73,537.04,126.45,6.12;4,140.06,545.01,228.23,6.12;4,140.36,552.98,260.32,6.12;4,139.67,560.95,242.08,6.12;4,140.49,568.92,264.92,6.12;4,140.41,576.89,250.63,6.12;4,140.34,584.86,255.92,6.12;5,139.08,122.03,247.41,6.12;5,140.13,130.00,261.45,6.12;5,139.08,137.97,261.16,6.12;5,136.86,145.94,19.64,6.12;5,135.46,161.88,98.12,6.12;5,140.97,169.85,235.89,6.12;5,140.33,177.82,241.37,6.12;5,140.49,185.79,236.39,6.12;5,140.65,193.76,231.94,6.12;5,140.80,201.73,137.91,6.12;5,136.86,209.70,19.64,6.12"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>2014 -03 -28 * * ] D i s c h a r g e Date : [ * * 2014 -04 -08 * * ] Date o f B i r t h : [ * * 1930 -09 -21 * * ] Sex : F S e r v i c e : CARDIOTHORACIC A l l e r g i e s : P a t i e n t r e c o r d e d a s h a v i n g No Known A l l e r g i e s t o Drugs A t t e n d i n g : [ * * A t t e n d i n g I n f o 5 6 5 * * ] C h i e f Complaint : Chest p a i n Major S u r g i c a l o r I n v a s i v e P r o c e d u r e : Coronary a r t e r y b y p a s s g r a f t 4 .
