<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nowadays, consumers often search online to seek medical and health care information that they need.

The best performance was achieved by VSM, with MAP of 0.1480, P@10 of 0.3700 and nDCG@10 of 0.3363. Experimental results indicate that VSM and semantic vector model are complementary, and suggest combining these methods may further improve performance.</p></div>

This paper describes our participation in this task. In order to detect latent semantic relations between queries about disorders and webpages (i.e. relations between queries and webpages that are relevant but do not contain the terms in the query), a semantic vector model based on distributional semantics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,334.33,603.61,16.61,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is used as the information retrieval model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Overview</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,154.34,292.09,4.92,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the process of our proposed method for medical disorders information retrieval. The raw webpages are preprocessed to extract main content by the Html parser Tika 1 . Tokenization and stop words removal are then conducted, based on which indexes used for query retrieval are built. Each query in the training and test sets contains three parts, namely the title, description and narrative. We extract content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives) from these three parts as the final query for information retrieval. Query expansion is also conducted using the UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="3,125.56,376.09,15.30,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Results are retrieved by two different information retrieval models, namely, the vector space model and the semantic vector model. Details of the two models are described as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Information Retrieval Model</head><p>This paper employs two different information retrieval models: one is the vector space model, as one of the state-of-the-art benchmarks in information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="3,452.30,451.69,15.30,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Another is the semantic vector model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,296.48,463.93,15.30,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which has been attracting research attention for effectively revealing latent semantic relations between terms and documents (unlike the VSM, which will only retrieve documents containing at least one of the query terms).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Vector Space Model</head><p>Represent the document 𝒅 𝒋 and the query 𝒒 as vectors, 𝒅 ! = 𝒘 𝟏,𝐣 , … , 𝒘 𝒏,𝒋 and 𝒒= 𝒘 𝟏,𝐪 , … , 𝒘 𝒏,𝒒 in an n-dimensional vector space <ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.90,554.51,15.30,9.11" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Each dimension corresponds to a unigram, with tf.idf as the value. The cosine similarity between 𝒅 𝒋 and 𝒒 is used for relevance ranking of documents. It is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,247.58,611.72,101.80,18.93">𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝒅 ! , 𝒒 = 𝒅 ! • 𝒒 𝒅 𝒋 • 𝒒<label>(1)</label></formula><p>1 http://tika.apache.org/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Semantic Vector Model</head><p>Methods of distributional semantics <ref type="bibr" coords="4,281.20,171.37,7.97,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,293.16,171.37,7.97,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref> assume that words and concepts with similar contextual distributions have similar or related meanings. In the semantic vector model we employ, words and concepts are represented by high-dimensional vectors in a mathematical space. Two vectors with a close distance in that space are considered to have high semantic similarity or relevance <ref type="bibr" coords="4,353.81,219.37,15.30,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>One key issue of semantic vector model is to reduce dimensions to improve processing performance, and in some cases measures of semantic relatedness. Random Indexing <ref type="bibr" coords="4,202.65,255.37,12.83,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,219.75,255.37,12.83,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> offers an efficient and effective method for reducing the dimensionality of the semantic space. The process of random indexing is as follows: 1) Generate an m-dimensional index vector for each term. The term index vectors are generated using random projection <ref type="bibr" coords="4,301.81,291.37,15.30,8.64" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which projects the n-dimensional (m &lt;&lt; n) term vector in to a lower dimensional subspace. Each index vector is a sparse vector with a small number of +1 and -1 values like 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 … -1, 0, -1, 0, 0 . Two arbitrary vectors are nearly orthogonal to each other, so that the distance between original vectors can be preserved <ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.85,339.37,15.30,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Terms that co-occur directly will have similar vector representations 2) Sum index vectors of terms contained in a document to generate the document index vector. Reflection: 3) Sum index vectors of documents containing a term to re-generate the term index vector. 4) Iterate between 2) and 3) to reflectively generate index vectors, so that to reveal higher-order relations between terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Query Expansion Using the UMLS</head><p>Previous work of query expansion <ref type="bibr" coords="4,269.11,479.53,16.61,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref> using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,163.79,491.53,16.61,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref> has achieved performance enhancement for information retrieval. We used content words extracted from queries as input and use UMLS API <ref type="bibr" coords="4,416.49,503.53,16.61,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref> to obtain possible Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI). Terms belonging to the top ranked CUI of the content word were used as expanded queries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>The open source toolkit Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="4,255.40,602.23,3.24,5.69" target="#foot_0">2</ref> is used for index building and information retrieval by VSM. Another open source toolkit, Semantic Vectors<ref type="foot" coords="4,354.52,614.23,3.24,5.69" target="#foot_1">3</ref> , is used for semantic vector index building and information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="4,296.43,628.57,12.17,8.64" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,312.65,628.57,12.17,8.64" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Based on the manual annotations provided by the task organizer, performance on the training set is evaluated by MAP and P@10. Performance on the test set is evaluated by MAP, P@10 and nDCG@10.</p><p>MAP, as in equation 2, is abbreviated for mean average precision, which is the mean of the average precision scores for each query q in a query set Q. P@10 is the number of relevant results on the top ten search results. DCG, as in equation 3, uses a graded relevance scale rel i to evaluate the usefulness of a document based on its position in the result list. DCG assumes highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized. (Normalized Cumulative Gain) is the normalization of DCG value of the ideal ranking at rank n.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,242.96,245.64,118.54,21.63">MAP = !"#$%#&amp;'(')*(!) ! !!! !

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,151.59,488.65,4.92,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the performance of the employed methods on the training queries for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 shared task 3. VSM and SemVec obtained comparable results. Query expansion using UMLS achieved enhancements both for VSM and SemVec, especially in P@10, with an improvement of 100% for VSM, and an improvement of 75% for SemVec. The MAP also increased about 50% for VSM. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,153.53,548.65,4.92,8.64" target="#tab_2">2</ref> displays the performance of our methods on the test queries. The best performance was achieved by the baseline method, i.e., VSM, with MAP of 0.1480, P@10 of 0.3700 and nDCG@10 of 0.3363. Nevertheless, performance of the other three methods dropped severely on all the three evaluation criteria compared with VSM. Furthermore, in contrast to a performance increase using query expansion on the training set, the test set illustrated a performance decrease. One possible reason of these differences could be the different pooling sets used for evaluation between the two sets. The pooling set for training was built from results from two information retrieval models, VSM and Okapi BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,292.85,385.45,15.30,8.64" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In contrast, the pooling set for test was built from the results submitted from all participants. Another reason could be the different information needs contained in the two sets. In addition to questions asking for disorder definition and treatment in the training set, relational questions asking for connections between other entities and disorders account for a large proportion in the test set, such as "&lt;desc&gt; can chest pain hinder the transplantation of liver? &lt;/desc&gt;" and ""&lt;desc&gt; what is the connection between acidosis and metastasic adeno carcinoma&lt;/desc&gt;". The employed methods in our experiment may not be suitable for retrieving relevant information for such kind of information needs. As illustrated by the P@10 plots provided by the task organizer, both VSM and SemVec contributed best P@10 for several different queries. Looking into the results of VSM and SemVec, it was found that they retrieved different relevant webpages from the index. Take test query 12 "&lt;desc&gt;is clots in jugular in connection with HIV&lt;/desc&gt;" as an example, VSM mainly retrieved webpages informative of HIV. Nevertheless, SemVec obtained more navigational webpages containing links to diverse aspects of HIV, with each link leading to an informative webpage focusing a specific aspect of HIV. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,253.36,489.37,4.92,8.64" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a navigational webpage of HIV retrieved by SemVec.</p><p>Furthermore, relevant webpages with different topics of the query were retrieved. As an example, for test query 10 "&lt;desc&gt;is there a connection between multiple sclerosis and dysplasia in oesophagus&lt;/desc&gt;", VSM obtained three relevant webpages about "dysplasia in oesophagus" and one about "multiple sclerosis", while SemVec found eight relevant webpages about "multiple sclerosis". Those observations demonstrate that these two methods are complementary to each other and may be combined to produce more diverse and relevant results.</p></div>
