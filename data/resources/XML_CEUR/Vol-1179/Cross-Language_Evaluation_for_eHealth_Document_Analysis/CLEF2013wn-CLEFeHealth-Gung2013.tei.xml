<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes a system for span detection and normalization of disorder mentions in clinical notes as defined in Tasks 1a and 1b of the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,403.58,289.64,9.22,7.86" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We take a supervised learning, chunking-based approach to identifying disorder spans. In particular, our system introduces a method for identifying the spans of disjoint and overlapping disorder mentions using relation extraction and semantic role labeling (SRL). Our primary objective was to demonstrate the utility of relations for resolving the spans of disjoint disorder mentions. We used a CRF-based sequence labeler to extract initial disorder spans. Using these spans, we applied a locational relation extractor and SRL system to locate pairs of spans belonging to the same disorder mention. We used a dictionary-based approach to disorder normalization. Under strict evaluation for Task 1a, our system performed 3rd out of the 15 best performing systems for each team, achieving an F-measure of 0.687. For Task 1b, our system achieved a strict F-measure of 0.441. Our disjoint span resolution system significantly improved the performance of our system in both tasks, achieving a 5.5% increase over our baseline system in Task 1a and a 7.8% increase in Task 1b.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Task Description</head><p>Task 1 of the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,395.33,537.56,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> had two components: span detection and normalization of disorders. The 2013 dataset consists of 300 discharge summaries, echo reports, ECG reports, and radiology reports taken from the MIMIC II database <ref type="bibr" coords="1,297.89,573.43,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. 100 of these were reserved for evaluation. Each document was annotated with disorders and corresponding CUIs (concept unique identifiers). Disorders were defined to be any span of text that could be mapped to a concept in SNOMED-CT terminology belonging to the Disorder semantic group <ref type="bibr" coords="1,243.35,621.25,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Annotated disorder mentions often covered disjoint (non-contiguous) spans of text and in some cases overlapped. These characteristics pose many problems to traditional chunking-based approaches to NER and motivated much of the work in our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>We approach the task of identifying disorder spans as a supervised sequence labeling problem. Our system uses relation extraction and semantic role labeling to identify the spans of disjoint and overlapping disorder mentions. Our baseline system for the disorder span identification task uses a CRF (conditional random field) sequence labeler. The clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) is used to preprocess the data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.87,204.39,9.96,8.74">[4]</ref>. cTAKES is an open-source NLP system for information extraction from medical records built upon the UIMA framework. When extracting features, training and applying our sequence labeler, our system uses several components from ClearTK's machine learning module <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.00,252.21,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. ClearTK is a framework for developing NLP applications also built upon Apache UIMA. CUI normalization is accomplished using a combination of rules and the cTAKES dictionary lookup algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Training Data</head><p>Before training the sequence labeler, we split up multi-span annotations into individual disorder annotations. For example, right atrium and dilated are annotated as disjoint spans within the disorder annotation right atrium dilated in the sentence "The right atrium is moderately dilated." These disjoint spans are automatically annotated as independent disorder spans, while the original annotation is removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Processing Pipeline</head><p>The majority of preprocessing is accomplished using cTAKES components. Our baseline system's preprocessing pipeline consists of tokenization, sentence segmentation, part of speech tagging and NP-chunking. Finally, the cTAKES dictionary lookup module is applied over NPs found during chunking, providing entity mention annotations (drugs, diseases/disorders, signs/symptoms, anatomical sites, labs, procedures, and their associated CUIs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sequence Labeling</head><p>Our system uses the CRFsuite linear-chain CRF implementation for sequence labeling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.79,561.33,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, wrapped into UIMA using ClearTK's machine learning module. After finding no significant improvements from the use of more advanced chunking schemes, we chose to apply the IOB (inside-outside-begin) chunking formalism.</p><p>Our system uses a combination of orthographic/lexical, syntactic and semantic features commonly used in named entity recognition. All orthographic/lexical and syntactic features are repeated in a window around the current token. A window of +/-2 tokens was found to provide the best performance on the training data. The normalized form of each token is extracted using a hand-crafted dictionary and is then used as a feature. We also incorporate two domain-dependent features. Discourse section refers to the heading preceding the current section of text. With the observation that sections were generally colon-delimited in the task data, we naively identify the current discourse section as the text immediately preceding the previous colon. Document type is extracted from the filename of the document currently being processed. In the task data, the document type (ECHO REPORT, ECG REPORT, DISCHARGE SUMMARY, or RADIOLOGY REPORT) could be found in the filename directly before the file extension (.txt).</p><p>Entity mentions extracted using the cTAKES the dictionary lookup module are used in the system as semantic features. Each entity type overlapping the span of the current token is included as a feature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Disjoint Span Resolution</head><p>After identifying an initial set of disorder spans during sequence labeling, we apply our disjoint span resolution system to connect pairs of disjoint spans belonging to the same entities. This is accomplished using relations extracted with the  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,282.10,355.32,78.81,8.74">[tumor, abdomen]</ref>) between pairs of entities identified with the cTAKES dictionary lookup algorithm. To identify semantic role relations, we use the ClearNLP semantic role labeler <ref type="bibr" coords="4,385.96,379.23,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, a transition-based SRL system, also trained on medical data. The SRL model we applied does not explicitly identify adjectival predicates such as dilated in the aortic root is moderately dilated. Therefore, in order to capture disjoint spans with adjectival predicates, we looked for be-predicates that belonged in multiple SRL relations (such as [aortic root, is] and [dilated, is]) and treated the identified spans corresponding to their arguments as potential relations.</p><p>Finally, if a relation's constituent elements are contained within disorder spans from the initial set found during sequence labeling, we create a new, multispan disorder mention from the corresponding spans. The old disorder spans are discarded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">CUI Normalization</head><p>To assign CUIs to the identified disorder spans, we apply a simple rule-based system in conjunction with the cTAKES dictionary lookup algorithm. We query cTAKES using the contents of each disorder mention as a lookup window. Because queries typically generate multiple results, we take several steps to filter candidate CUIs. First, we only consider identified annotations that cover the entire span. For example, effusion and pericardial in pericardial effusion are removed from consideration. Secondly, we only consider candidates that have TUIs (semantic type unique identifiers) belonging in the Disorder/Finding semantic groups. Finally, if no candidates are found, we mark the disorder span as CUI-less.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>Two runs were submitted for each task. In both tasks, CLEAR NoRel corresponds to our baseline system without any disjoint span resolution while CLEAR Rel incorporates our disjoint span resolution system. The tables below summarize the results for Task 1a and 1b using the SNOMED-CT 2011 gold standard. Also included in the tables are the results for the three best-performing systems out of all the teams excluding our system.</p><p>In Task 1a with strictly matching spans, CLEAR Rel performed 3rd out of the 15 best performing systems for each team. Adding the disjoint span resolution system increased our baseline system's F-score by 0.036, a 5.5% improvement. For CUI normalization with strict evaluation, our system observed a 0.032 increase in after adding disjoint span resolution, a 7.8% improvement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>We've introduced a system for disorder span detection and CUI normalization. An initial set of disorder spans are identified using a CRF-based IOB sequence labeler. CUI normalization is accomplished using the cTAKES dictionary lookup module and several simple rules. Using relations to resolve disjoint and overlapping spans significantly improves system performance in both disorder span detection and CUI normalization. A more sophisticated system for normalizing abbreviations and acronyms would likely improve performance and make the system extensible to domains beyond ECGs, echo reports, radiographs and discharge summaries. Furthermore, CRFs have no built in capacity for capturing long distance dependencies <ref type="bibr" coords="6,467.31,358.28,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. This was visible in our error analysis where we found inconsistent treatment of identical spans of text in varying contexts. Intuitively, identical spans of text in the same domain should be consistently annotated the same way.</p><p>Although the cTAKES relation extractor and ClearNLP SRL system correctly identified many relations corresponding to entities with disjoint spans, many were also missed. For example, neither locational relations nor predicateargument relations capture disjoint spans in coordination structures such as "right and left ventricles enlarged" in which right ventricles enlarged and left ventricles enlarged are both disjoint entities. Better results might be achieved by training a model to identify the relations that correspond to disjoint spans using the output from a simple dependency parse.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,134.77,414.77,345.82,7.89;3,134.77,425.75,27.14,7.86"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
