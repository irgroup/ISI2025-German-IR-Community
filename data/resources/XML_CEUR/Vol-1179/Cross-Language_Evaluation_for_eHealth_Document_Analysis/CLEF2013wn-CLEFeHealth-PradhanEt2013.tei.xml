This task focused on identification (1a) and normalization (1b) of diseases and disorders in clinical reports. It used annotations from the ShARe corpus. A total of 22 teams competed in Task 1a and 17 of them also participated Task 1b. The best systems had an F1 score of 0.75 (0.80 Precision, 0.71 Recall) in Task 1a and an accuracy of 0.59 in Task 1b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A large amount of very useful information -both for the medical researchers and the patients -is present in the form of unstructured text within the clinical notes and discharge summaries that form a patient's medical history. Adapting and extending NLP techniques to mine this information can open doors to better, novel, clinical studies on one hand, and help patients understand the contents of their clinical records on the other. Organization of this shared task helps establish state-of-the-art baselines and paves way to further explorations. The shared task was one of three shared tasks organized at the CLEF eHealth Evaluation Labs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,470.07,593.19,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,134.77,605.15,7.75,8.74" target="#b1">2]</ref> WWC, BRS, and DLM led the task; WWC, BRS, DLM, NE, SP, and GS defined the task; GS and NE led the annotation effort; AV provided coordination and management of the annotations; HS co-chaired the lab; DLM, BRS and LC processed and distributed the dataset; and DM and WWC led result evaluations</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data</head><p>The ShARe corpus<ref type="foot" coords="2,217.58,138.88,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">7</ref> comprises of annotations over de-identified clinical reports from from US intensive care (version 2.5 of the MIMIC II database<ref type="foot" coords="2,428.86,150.84,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">8</ref> .) The corpus consisted of discharge summaries and electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and radiology reports. Although the clinical reports were de-identified, they still needed to be treated with appropriate care and respect. Hence, all participants were required to register to the lab, obtain a US human subjects training certificate<ref type="foot" coords="2,164.65,210.61,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">9</ref> , create an account to a password-protected site on the Internet, specify the purpose of data usage, accept the data use agreement, and get their account approved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task Description</head><p>The annotation of disorder mentions in clinical reports was carried out as part of the ongoing ShARe project<ref type="foot" coords="2,253.26,297.38,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_3">10</ref> . For this task in the evaluation lab, the focus was on the annotation of disorder mentions only. As such, there were two parts to the annotation: identifying a span of text as a disorder mention and mapping the span to a UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="2,211.71,334.82,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> CUI. Each note was annotated by two professional coders trained for this task, followed by an open adjudication step. UMLS<ref type="foot" coords="2,419.95,345.20,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_4">11</ref> represented over 130 lexicons/thesauri with terms from a variety of languages. It integrated resources used world-wide in clinical care, public health, and epidemiology. It also provided a semantic network in which every concept is represented by its CUI and is semantically typed <ref type="bibr" coords="2,267.12,394.59,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A disorder mention was defined as any span of text which can be mapped to a concept in SNOMED-CT and which belongs to the Disorder semantic group <ref type="foot" coords="2,257.66,416.93,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_5">12</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation Methods</head><p>The following evaluation criteria were used: 1a. correctness in identification of the character spans of disorders, 1b. correctness in mapping disorders to SNOMED-CT codes, In Tasks 1a and 1b each participating team was permitted to upload the outputs of up to two systems. Task 1b was optional for Task 1 participants. Teams were allowed to use additional annotations in their systems, but this counted towards the permitted systems; systems that used annotations outside of those provided were evaluated separately. The evaluation for all tasks was conducted using the blind, withheld test data. The participants were provided a training set containing clinical text as well as pre-annotated spans and named entities for disorders (Tasks 1a and 1b). For Task 1a, participants were instructed to develop a system that predicts the spans for disorder named entities. For Tasks 1b, participants were instructed to develop a system that predicts the SNOMED-CT code. The outputs needed to follow the annotation format. The corpus of reports was split into 200 training and 100 testing. The system performance was evaluated agaist the criteria by using the F1 score in Task 1a and Accuracy in Tasks 1b. We relied on non-parametric statistical significance tests called random shuffling <ref type="bibr" coords="3,211.45,315.20,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> to better compare the measure values for the systems and benchmarks. In Task 1a, the F1 score was defined as the harmonic mean of Precision (P) and Recall (R); P as n T P /(n T P + n F P ); R as n T P /(n T P + n F N ); n T P as the number of instances, where the spans identified by the system and gold standard were the same; n F P as the number of spurious spans by the system; and n F N as the number of missing spans by the system. We referred to the Exact (Relaxed) F1-score if the system span is identical to (overlaps) the gold standard span. In Tasks 1b the Accuracy was defined as the number of preannotated spans with correctly generated code divided by the total number of pre-annotated spans. In both tasks, the Exact Accuracy and Relaxed Accuracy were measured. In the Exact Accuracy for Task 1b, total was defined as the total number of gold standard named entities. In this case, the system was penalised for incorrect code assignment for annotations that were not detected by the system. In the Relaxed Accuracy for Task 1b, total was defined as the total number of named entities with strictly correct span generated by the system. In this case, the system was only evaluated on annotations that were detected by the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">System Results</head><p>A total of 22 teams competed in Task 1a and 16 of them also participated Task 1b. The performance of these systems is detailed in Tables <ref type="table" coords="3,400.47,569.34,4.98,8.74">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="3,429.58,569.34,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>We have created a reference standard with high inter-annotator agreement and evaluated systems on the task of identification and normalization of diseases and disorders apprearing in clinical reports.
