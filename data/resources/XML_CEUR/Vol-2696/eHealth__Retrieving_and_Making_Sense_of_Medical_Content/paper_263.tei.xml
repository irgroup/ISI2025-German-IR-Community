<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Clinical coding requires the analysis and transformation of medical narratives into a structured or coded format using internationally recognized classification systems like ICD-10. These codes represent medical diagnoses and procedures. Clinical coding is critical for standardizing medical records, particularly for health information management systems used to carry out biomedical/ epidemiological research studies, monitor health trends or facilitate medical billing and reimbursement. The growing amount of clinical records has prompted the search for tools that assist manual coding. Inspired by the CCMC challenge and various eHealth CLEF shared tasks, we organized the CodiEsp track. Codiesp (eHealth CLEF 2020-Multilingual Information Extraction Shared Task) represents the first effort to promote the development and evaluation of automatic clinical coding systems for medical documents in Spanish. In this context, we have published a set of resources including (i) a manually coded Gold Standard corpus with inter-coder agreement and supporting textual evidence statements, (ii) an additional large collection of medical literature indexed with ICD-10 clinical codes and (iii) a machine translated corpus to enable multilingual approaches and testing of previous strategies developed for data in English. We have received a total of 168 runs submitted by 22 teams from 11 countries for at least one of our three sub-tracks: CodiEsp-D (Diagnosis Coding), CodiEsp-P (Procedure Coding) and CodiEsp-X (Explainable AI). Despite the considerable complexity of this task, which can be viewed as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem using ICD-10 codes as labels and documents as input, participants obtained very promising results, specially for codes that were well covered by the training data. Participants examined a variety of strategies, specifically deep learning approaches, pre-trained language models and word embeddings (BERT, BETO, FastText, etc.), as well as NER, string lookup and knowledge graph approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Public health emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 global health crisis, further highlight the need of efficient search, retrieval, analysis, integration as well as exploitation strategies for a diversity of medical content types. This is particularly true for the medical literature, where clinical case reports characterizing in detail the symptoms and signs experienced by individual patients, together with the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up information, constitute a valuable evidence source for the possible pathogenesis of a disease and suitable therapeutic approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,239.25,228.46,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Direct extraction of relevant information from electronic health records (EHRs) written by healthcare professionals represents a highly challenging problem due to (a) the rapid data accumulation and large data volumes (size, growth, performance, scalability problem), (b) the diversity of types, structures, formats and even character encodings in which clinical records are being produced (document standardization/harmonization problem), (c) the complex and rich medical domain specific vocabulary/terminologies and language characteristics being used (specialized domain problem) and (d) the diversity of languages and language variants in which clinical records are being written worldwide (multilingual content challenge).</p><p>Structured clinical information, in the form of coded clinical data relying on controlled indexing vocabularies such as ICD-10<ref type="foot" coords="2,345.41,358.76,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is a key resource for statistical analysis techniques applied to patient data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,320.98,372.29,14.61,8.74" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. The results of clinical coding activities are being used, for instance, as aggregated data to analyze retrospective and prospective aspects of information contained in electronic health records (EHRs). Clinical coding is a complex and time-consuming process, carried out by trained experts. This task requires the assignment of codes from a clinical classification (typically the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems or ICD-10) that essentially represents diagnoses and procedures associated to electronic health records.</p><p>The use of automatic systems to assist coding experts is becoming increasingly relevant to keep up with the pace of newly generated clinical texts. Automated clinical coding systems represent also a mechanism to improve coverage and consistency during the transformation process of EHRs into their corresponding structured representations.</p><p>Clinical natural language processing and AI-based document indexing strategies can result in resources useful for automatic clinical coding, directly exploiting the unstructured content of EHRs. Such tools play an increasing role to generate results that complement health informatics approaches focusing on translational medicine challenges, by providing relevant diagnostic information extracted from clinical narratives. This implies that text mining generated clinical coding results can provide a rich clinical context for patient health information necessary for other downstream data analysis processes like bioinformatics and OMICS data exploration. Figure ?? shows a general view of a canonical text mining flowchart and underlying tasks. Currently, most research on clinical NLP applies to English texts; however, there is a considerable amount of biomedical documents generated in non-English languages. The importance of clinical coding in languages other than English has driven challenges to promote automatic clinical coding systems. There have been community efforts to develop such clinical coding systems in English. In addition, in recent years, shared tasks for clinical coding have been proposed for English <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,465.56,15.50,8.74" target="#b35">[37]</ref> as well as content in non-English languages such as French <ref type="bibr" coords="3,423.11,465.56,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, German <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,477.52,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or Japanese <ref type="bibr" coords="3,208.65,477.52,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, more limited research has been done in Spanish, despite the large volume of clinical content generated in this language, not only in Europe but worldwide. The success of these to competitions precedes CodiEsp, the first shared task on clinical case report coding in Spanish. The volume and growth rate of clinical texts written in Spanish worldwide justifies the need to promote not only the development of new text mining resources for clinical and medical narratives in Spanish, but also to carry out shared tasks and evaluation efforts to assure that the quality and used methods are competitive enough to be of practical value <ref type="bibr" coords="3,224.59,573.16,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,237.97,573.16,12.73,8.74" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,253.57,573.16,12.73,8.74" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,269.17,573.16,11.62,8.74" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Therefore, and also due to the interest in the health sector by the language technology industry, one of the flagship projects of the Spanish National Plan for the Advancement of Language Technology (Plan TL) is related to the clinical and biomedical field <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.51,609.02,14.61,8.74" target="#b46">[48]</ref>.</p><p>In the following sections, we will summarize the CodiEsp shared task setting, evaluation metrics, corpus preparation/annotation process, as well as the results produced by participating teams and a short summary of the used methodologies.</p><p>The CodiEsp<ref type="foot" coords="4,197.22,142.00,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> track proposes participants the challenge of building an automatic clinical coding system for Spanish documents. Participant systems have to automatically assign ICD-10 codes (CIE-10 in Spanish) to clinical case documents. Evaluation is done by comparing automatically generated results against manually manually generated ICD-10 codifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Subtasks</head><p>CodiEsp is structured into three different subtasks, two of them directly related to the two main branches of ICD-10 terminology. Moreover, to improve systems' acceptance, usefulness and practical integration into clinical coding support applications, results must be understandable, traceable to human-interpretable evidence sources and transparent. To that extent, in addition to two traditional coding subtasks, the CodiEsp shared task proposes a novel subtask on Explainable/Interpretable AI. Systems that participated in this subtask had to recognize the correct clinical codes and return the corresponding evidence text supporting the code assignment. The CodiEsp track comprised the following three subtracks:</p><p>-CodiEsp Diagnosis Coding sub-task (CodiEsp-D): required automatic ICD-10-CM [CIE10 Diagn√≥stico] code assignment. This sub-track evaluated systems that predict ICD-10-CM codes (in the Spanish translation, CIE10-Diagn√≥stico codes). A list of valid codes for this sub-task with their English and Spanish description was provided by the task organizers<ref type="foot" coords="4,418.87,418.97,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . -CodiEsp Procedure Coding main sub-task (CodiEsp-P): required automatic ICD-10-PCS [CIE10 Procedimiento] code assignment. This sub-track evaluated systems that predict ICD-10-PCS codes (in the Spanish translation, CIE10-Procedimiento codes). A list of valid codes for this sub-task with their English and Spanish description was provided by the task organizers. -CodiEsp Explainable AI exploratory sub-task (CodiEsp-X). Participating systems were asked to return in addition to clinical code assignments supporting evidence texts extracted from documents. Both ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes were used for this subtask. Evaluation was done against a collection of manually labeled evidence texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Shared task setting and schedule</head><p>The CodiEsp track was organized in the form of three basic participation periods:</p><p>1. Training phase. During the initial participation period, a random subset of the entire corpus was published corresponding to the training data collection. x It consisted of plain text documents and their corresponding annotations, i.e. ICD-10 code assignments and manually labeled evidence texts. During this period, teams started implementing their automatic clinical coding strategies by exploiting this dataset. 2. Development phase. Next, a second subset of the corpus was released (development data). This dataset served to fine tune and improve the initial predictive coding systems. 3. Test phase. Finally, the test set was released. This third subset of the corpus was distributed without providing manual annotations/code assignments. Participants had to return for all test set documents their corresponding ICD-10 codes. After the submission deadline, the shared task organizers evaluated team predictions against manual code assignments/annotations. A total of 5 runs were allowed for each subtrack per team, so that participants could explore different strategies and methodological approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evaluation metrics used for CodiEsp</head><p>In case of the CodiEsp-Diagnostic and CodiEsp-Procedure subtasks, automatic predictions returned by teams had to consist in ranked codes. The primary evaluation metric for these two subtasks was Mean Average Precision (MAP). Mean Average Precision (MAP) is a widely used evaluation score for ranking problems: AveP = (P (k) * rel(k)) number of relevant documents where, P(k) is the precision at the position k, and rel(k) is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank k is a relevant document, zero otherwise.</p><p>MAP has shown good discrimination and stability <ref type="bibr" coords="5,379.68,620.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b27">[29]</ref>. For completeness, error analysis, and comparison to previous efforts, other metrics were also computed: MAP@k (MAP taking into account just the first k results), f1-score, precision, and recall. Participants of the CodiEsp-Explainability subtask were evaluated with micro balanced f1-score, precision, and recall since its scope is different and more complicated. A complete overview of all used evaluation metrics for the CodiEsp track is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,204.01,539.51,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In addition, Table <ref type="table" coords="6,296.99,539.51,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows an evaluation example.</p><p>CodiEsp baseline system. To provide context to the obtained task results, we implemented a baseline system using dictionary lookup and vocabulary transfer. This baseline system selects manually labeled text spans from the training and development collections, using these mentions afterwards as a gazetteer for lexical looking up in the test set documents. The lookup was strict. However, texts had been previously tokenized and normalized (transformed to lowercase, accents were removed, extra blank spaces or punctuation signs were ignored). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Corpora and Resources</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">CodiEsp corpus</head><p>The CodiEsp corpus<ref type="foot" coords="7,222.11,406.09,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> is a collection of 1,000 clinical case reports written in Spanish that cover a diversity of medical specialities. The training subset consisted in 500 documents, while the development and test set consisted in 250 documents each. All documents were exhaustively, manually annotated by professional clinical coders with codes from the Spanish version of ICD-10 (procedure and diagnostic). Additionally, human annotators had to label or mark up clinical-coding evidence text fragments. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,278.46,479.39,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows an example document with manually annotated codes, and Table <ref type="table" coords="7,262.38,491.35,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows an example of an annotated sentence in Spanish and in English.</p><p>The manual annotation process followed official clinical coding guidelines published for Spain. CodiEsp documents were coded with the 2018 version of CIE-10 (the official Spanish version of ICD-10-Clinical Modification and ICD-10-Procedures) and inspired by the "Manual de Codificaci√≥n CIE-10-ES Diagn√≥sticos 2018" and the "Manual de Codificaci√≥n CIE-10-ES Procedimientos 2018" provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. To cover aspects and particularities relevant to the sub-tasks and documents used for CodiEsp, together with the corpus itself, a document describing the annotation guidelines was published <ref type="foot" coords="7,134.77,609.96,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . Clinical codes (diagnostic and procedure) were linked to textual evidence fragments that support their assignment (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,348.91,623.49,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Code</head><p>Textual evidence Spanish: El paciente present√≥ un cuadro brusco de disnea, v√≥mitos y p√©rdida de conocimiento. English automatic translation: The patient developed sudden dyspnea, vomiting, loss of consciousness r55 r06.00 r11.10 disnea v√≥mitos p√©rdida de conocimiento To guarantee annotation quality, we performed an iterative process of guideline refinement and consistency analysis through comparison between independent annotations provided by multiple clinical coders. Several initial annotation rounds were necessary until an acceptable level of manual annotation quality was obtained. For the annotation of diagnostic codes, the final pairwise percentage agreement obtained was 88.6%, 88.9% for procedure codes and 80.5% for the annotation of textual evidence.</p><p>Corpus format. Gold Standard CodiEsp corpus is distributed in the CodiEsp format: documents are provided in plain text format, and annotations are released in a tab-separated file. Each line of the file corresponds to a code assignment. This format is coherent with the data format used in the 2019 CLEF clinical coding shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="8,250.98,562.94,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,319.93,562.94,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_3">3</ref> for an example of the tab-separated file with annotation information. In it, there are examples of discontinuous textual evidence and codes with more than one textual evidence.</p><p>Corpus statistics. In total, the entire CodiEsp corpus contains 18435 annotations, with the DIAGNOSTIC class more common than the PROCEDURE class: 77.8% of the annotations correspond to diagnostics. The 18435 annotations contain 3427 unique ICD-10 codes. Again, there are more diagnostic than procedure codes: 2557 and 870, respectively. We hypothesise that it is more complicated for an automatic system to predict procedures, since the corpus contains fewer examples. However, since there are also less unique procedure codes, this difficulty may be partially addressed. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,325.91,267.36,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> contains a summary of the corpus statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Additional resources</head><p>We have generated a collection of additional resources to overcome the size limitation of our Gold Standard CodiEsp corpus. These resources included:</p><p>CodiEsp MT corpus <ref type="foot" coords="9,240.16,368.08,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . The CodiEsp shared task attracted participants from many non-Spanish speaking countries. In addition, there are already many clinical coding systems for data in English. To ease the comparison with such systems, provide support to participants working previously in English and to explore the use of machine-translated corpora, we generated a machine translated version of the CodiEsp corpus (CodiEsp MT corpus). The used machine translation system was adapted to the language characteristics of the medical domain <ref type="bibr" coords="9,428.61,441.38,14.61,8.74" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>CodiEsp-abstracts<ref type="foot" coords="9,232.60,469.26,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_6">7</ref> . To increase the size and number of possible training instances, we prepared a dump of medical literature abstracts from the Lilacs [26] and IBECS <ref type="bibr" coords="9,205.91,494.74,15.50,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> bibliographic resources. Those were indexed manually with either DeCS or MeSH terms. Using a mapping chain [DeCS -‚Üí MeSH -‚Üí UMLS -‚Üí ICD-10], we generated a collection of medical literature abstracts with associated ICD-10 codes. The resulting collection contains 176,294 Spanish medical abstracts indexed with ICD-10 codes.</p><p>A mapping chain was generated. DeCs is a terminological resource created to index journal articles, technical reports, and other health-related documents. It is based on MeSH (Medical Subject Heading), developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine <ref type="bibr" coords="9,225.73,590.38,14.61,8.74" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. Additionally, we used the UMLS Metathesaurus tool <ref type="bibr" coords="9,134.77,602.34,15.50,8.74" target="#b45">[47]</ref> to map MeSH terms to ICD-10 codes (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,380.82,602.34,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). This enabled us to build a mapping from DeCS terms to ICD-10 codes with this mapping chain PubMed machine-translation <ref type="foot" coords="10,289.67,251.60,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_7">8</ref> . A large collection of PubMed abstracts was automatically translated into Spanish using the same translation engine employed to translate the CodiEsp corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="10,320.36,277.08,14.61,8.74" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.

In the CodiEsp-Diagnostic subtask, there were 22 participants (78 runs). For the CodiEsp-Procedure track, we received 64 runs from 17 teams. The exploratory CodiEsp-Explainability subtask had 8 participants, which returned a total of 25 runs. In total, 167 novel clinical coding systems were generated in the context of CodiEsp. These numbers are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,220.64,552.77,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">6</ref> A detailed description of the participant teams is included in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,446.59,564.86,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p></div>

The top scoring results for each subtask were: -CodiEsp-Diagnostic. IXA-AAA, reached a MAP of 0.593. They obtained a high recall and a moderate precision. The highest f1-score was achieved by the IAM team, with 0.817 precision and 0.592 recall.  in training and development sets. Three teams in CodiEsp-Diagnostic subtask developed systems with an f1-score above 0.7.

Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,258.42,334.06,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_5">5</ref> also includes a third f1-score value in black. It corresponds to the same metric computed on the categories. ICD-10 terminology is tree-shaped (for Diagnostics) and axial (for Procedures). This characteristic means that the first digits of the code give different information than the last digits. As digits are located more to the right of the code, their information is more granular. Therefore, f1-score, precision, and recall were computed taking into account only the first three digits for CodiEsp-Diagnostic and the first four digits for CodiEsp-Procedure. Systems that correctly tag the category but fail on the more granular information could be a starting point that requires fine-tuning. And this is the case of most participant systems of CodiEsp (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,346.36,453.81,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="13,385.01,453.81,3.87,8.74">9</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="13,423.67,453.81,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_8">10</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="13,134.77,465.76,8.30,8.74" target="#tab_9">11</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Error analysis</head><p>In this error analysis, the focus was placed on codes that, despite being present more than four times in the training or development sets, were predicted correctly by less than 20% of the runs. Such codes could be considered as "difficult".</p><p>Difficult codes have discontinuous textual evidences. Codes with discontinuous text evidence were, in general, more difficult to detect correctly. As seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,201.06,632.21,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, in the training, development, and test sets the percentage of codes with discontinuous textual evidence is below 15%. However, in the subset of difficult codes, it approaches 30%. Besides, it is clear from Table <ref type="table" coords="14,278.88,292.40,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_6">7</ref> that results for CodiEsp-Procedure are worse than those for CodiEsp-Diagnostic. In the former, 38.7% of the textual evidence of the test sets are discontinuous. In the latter, 14.3%.</p><p>Additionally, codes that are well predicted by most teams include continuous pieces of evidence. In fact, among the codes successfully predicted in more than half of the runs, the proportion of discontinuous texts of evidence is 4.3%, while this proportion increases to 14.3% in the whole test set.</p><p>Difficult codes have longer textual evidences. Not only codes with discontinuous references are difficult to detect. Also, codes whose textual reference is longer are more challenging. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,317.05,422.07,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_6">6</ref>, we observe how the distribution of textual reference lengths is almost identical for the codes in the training, development, and test sets (blue and green). However, for our subset of codes of interest, the average length increases.</p><p>Less specific codes are predicted with higher accuracy. In diagnostics, codes ending with a 9 tend to be less specific than the others. For example, code M25.561 represents "pain in the right knee", while M25.569 is used for "pain in an unspecified knee". The same happens with procedure codes ending with Z. We have evaluated the codes predicted by more than 50% of participant runs. Those codes could be seen as "easier" codes since most systems assign them. And there are 34.2% of 9-ending codes in the training and development sets, 36.8% of such codes in the test set, while there are 52.5% of such codes in the "easy" subset of codes.</p><p>There are more abbreviations in procedures than in diagnostics. Abbreviations are a common problem when processing medical narratives. Their presence is ubiquitous in this type of texts, and their meaning varies from one medical specialty to another. We have looked for Spanish medical abbreviations, collected in the Spanish Medical Abbreviation DataBase <ref type="bibr" coords="15,395.01,118.99,14.61,8.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, in the textual pieces of evidence that justify the code assignment.</p><p>Abbreviations appear in the difficult subset of codes in a similar percentage as in the rest of the corpus. For instance, 18.9% of diagnostic code evidence have abbreviations, and that percentage in the difficult codes is 19.1%. However, abbreviations appear much less in a subset of "easy" codes (codes predicted by more than 50% of the runs), 13%. For procedures, the phenomenon is the same. Indeed, there are more abbreviations in the procedure than in the diagnostic textual evidences: 40% of procedure textual evidences contain abbreviations from the Spanish Medical Abbreviation DataBase, against 19.1% for diagnostic textual evidences. This might contribute to the difficulty of assigning procedure codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Participant Methodologies</head><p>Methodology distribution. With participants from diverse backgrounds, the range of methodologies employed is broad. For specific details of the participants' systems, we refer you to the particular articles. However, a simplified classification is presented in this paper. Participant systems were divided into those that employ language models (such as the popular BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="15,411.54,359.20,14.75,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), those that integrate other Machine Learning algorithms, and those that do not use Machine Learning. MAP and f1-score (taking into account codes present in training and development test) results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="15,337.50,395.06,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_7">7</ref> colored by methodology.</p><p>In the three subtasks, there are successful and unsuccessful teams in the three methodological groups. For example, the highest MAP in CodiEsp-Diagnostic is obtained by a team employing machine learning. In contrast, the top MAP scores for CodiEsp-Procedure was obtained by non-machine learning systems. The second-best f1-score in both subtasks was obtained by a fine-tuning Multilingual BERT (a language model) approach. Finally, it is noteworthy that in case of the CodiEsp-Explainability track, more teams were using non-machine learning strategies.</p><p>Participants descriptions. There have been three main approaches to automatic clinical coding:</p><p>-Classification. This approach considers that there are a set of documents that must be categorized. Every ICD-10 has its own category. For example, team ICB-UMA <ref type="bibr" coords="15,225.18,583.46,15.50,8.74" target="#b26">[28]</ref> followed this classification schema. -Named Entity Recognition. In this case, automatic systems must detect whether each clinical case word (or set of words) is a diagnostic, a procedure, or none of them. Examples of NER systems are FLE <ref type="bibr" coords="15,427.87,619.79,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or IAM <ref type="bibr" coords="15,151.70,631.75,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. -Combination. For example, IXA-AAA <ref type="bibr" coords="15,322.52,644.16,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> team combined a classifier and a NER system. Additionally, each of the two schemas (classification vs. NER) may be tackled using different technologies. In this overview, we have clustered the technologies in 3 classes:</p><p>-Non-machine learning approaches. For instance, IAM <ref type="bibr" coords="16,390.90,374.59,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> employs a dictionary lookup to perform NER. -Machine learning approaches. In this group, we find IXA-AAA <ref type="bibr" coords="16,428.60,398.39,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, that use XGBoost to perform document classification. -Language models. Within the teams using machine learning, a significant number of them employ language models. For example, the FLE team <ref type="bibr" coords="16,465.10,434.15,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> fine-tuned BERT Multilingual and The Mental Strokers <ref type="bibr" coords="16,396.98,446.10,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> BETO language model.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, the approaches followed by some of the teams are briefly described to illustrate the different methodologies. Descriptions of other participant teams are found in their system description papers.</p><p>-IXA-AAA. They combined a Machine Learning engine with a string similarity system. First, a binary XGBoost classifier was trained for each label. Since the XGBoost outputs a probability for each prediction, its output could be used directly in subtasks CodiEsp-Diagnostic and CodiEsp-Procedure. Texts were expanded to improve the XGBoost models, concatenating the medical entities extracted from the documents itself. Second, the string similarity system compares text fragments and ICD-10 code definitions using Levenshtein distance, Jaro Winkler algorithm, and Cosine Similarity on Multilingual BERT representations. ICD-10 standard definitions were expanded with non-standard terms, single-word descriptions, and even phrases frequently associated with the codes. The best system for CodiEsp-Diagnostic and CodiEsp-Procedure subtasks is a combination of XGBoost and Jaro</p><p>Winkler string similarity outputs. This combination obtained the highest MAP for the CodiEsp-Diagnostic subtask, 0.593 <ref type="bibr" coords="17,365.46,130.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. -IAM. IAM team has employed the same clinical coding system in past clinical coding shared tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="17,253.95,155.50,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Their system is based on a dictionary with a tree data structure built from CodiEsp annotations and ICD-10 terminology. Entities are detected in new documents if they match any of the stored entries of the dictionary. The match is performed by exact matching, Levenshtein matching, and abbreviation matching. This last matching modality uses a dictionary of abbreviations. To further improve the precision of the system, they removed terms that lead to many false positives. Their system obtained the highest f1-score in CodiEsp-Diagnostic and in CodiEsp-Procedure, 0.687 and 0.522, and the largest MAP in CodiEsp-Procedure, 0.493. Finally, it also achieved the highest f1-score in CodiEsp-Explainability (in an unofficial run), 0.611 <ref type="bibr" coords="17,202.65,275.05,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. -The Mental Strokers. They re-trained the BETO language model <ref type="bibr" coords="17,439.12,287.65,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> on the training set of CodiEsp until the perplexity stabilized. Next, they added a linear classification layer and fine-tuned the model to perform NER on the CodiEsp corpus. That had to be recognized corresponded to the codes present in the training and development sets. A model for diagnostics and a different one for procedures were created. Also, they tested and submitted a system based on a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to perform the same NER task but concluded that it was too conservative in entity detection.</p><p>With the fine-tuned language model, they obtained 0.445 MAP in CodiEsp-Procedures (the second position) <ref type="bibr" coords="17,298.18,395.24,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. -FLE. The FLE team used a two-step approach to detect ICD-10 codes in documents. First, diagnostic and procedure entities were identified using a NER system based on a pre-trained multilingual BERT. Second, the recognized entities were matched to ICD-10 code definitions or examples using Levenshtein distance. Also, they used an in-house text augmentation algorithm to increase the size of the training dataset artificially. The text augmentation algorithm was trained with the CodiEsp corpus, and examples from PubMed and MIMIC database translated to Spanish. Additionally, they tested different post-processing methods to detect and remove negated and overlapping entities. Finally, to rank the codes according to confidence, they used entity frequency and position: they considered that more frequent entities and entities mentioned closer to the end of the document were more likely to be correct. Their system obtained the highest f1-score in CodiEsp-Explainability, 0.611. Remarkably, FLE is one of the three participant teams from a commercial organization (Fujitsu, Spain) <ref type="bibr" coords="17,365.06,575.21,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Combined methodologies. Since teams had approached the challenge from different perspectives, we analyzed what would happen if we combined predictions from different approaches. This rationale was already followed by the IXA-AAA team when they combined an XGBoost classifier with a string matching system. For instance, we may combine predictions of the FLE (that fine-tuned mBERT for NER and Levenshtein distance to find ICD-10 code) and the IAM (that employed a tuned dictionary lookup) teams. The combination is an uncomplicated union. Any code predicted by any of the two systems is considered.</p><p>Compared with the manual gold standard, we observe in Table <ref type="table" coords="18,424.19,254.62,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_7">8</ref> how the f1score increases, and the resulting prediction is more balanced than the previous two. Both systems lacked a high recall, and combining them makes recall to increase. Precision decreases, but not as much. Then, the result is a prediction higher than any of the individual participant predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>The CodiEsp task (eHealthCLEF 2020 Task 1 on Multilingual Information Extraction), has attracted a considerable number of participants. There were only 3 CLEF subtasks with more registrations (ImageCLEF Task 3, medical; Check-That Task 1, Check-Worthiness on tweets; and LifeCLEF Task 2, BirdCLEF). Indeed, participant teams came from very diverse countries, despite the highly specialized and complex application domain (medical/clinical data) and the use of non-English textual data. In this sense, CodiEsp could be perceived as a more challenging task setting when compared to other CLEF competitions, such as ImageCLEF or LifeCLEF.</p><p>Novelty and Impact. To the best of our knowledge, the CodiEsp corpus is the first publicly available, manually annotated, clinical coding gold standard text corpus in Spanish. Despite the use of commercial tools for automatic clinical coding in hospitals and private companies, a setting for direct comparison and benchmarking using a common evaluation set, format and metrics was missing. CodiEsp has partially solved this problem. However, there is still a need for large data collections, including high quality manually coded anonymized EHRs from multiple hospitals.</p><p>Access to patient reports is a recurrent problem in clinical NLP due to privacy issues. Creative solutions, such as using clinical cases that have been carefully selected as a surrogate data of real clinical reports, might contribute to the development of clinical NLP infrastructures. In this sense, we have also employed document and individual sentence similarity (lexical/surface as well as semantic similarity) strategies comparing real EHRs (mainly discharge summaries and radiology reports) with clinical case reports to retrieve sentences that are basically equivalent for corpus construction and public release purposes. We call this kind of creative corpus construction, circumventing data privacy issues as the wandering corpus strategy, where data with legal redistribution issues can at least be emulated by publicly available data resources that are highly similar.</p><p>CodiEsp is a clinical coding shared task in Spanish. Despite this apparent language constraint, there have been participants from 9 non-Spanish speaking countries. One of the reasons may be that 57.9% of participants reported that their system is multilingual and not Spanish-specific. CodiEsp not only attracted participants from different countries, but also different backgrounds (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="19,468.97,365.97,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Even though Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning were the most numerous background, there were also participants coming from fields such as bioinformatics, linguistics, and medicine or biomedicine. Finally, 57.9% of the participants reported experience in clinical coding systems (or similar tasks) before CodiEsp, and most of them said that their motivation was "to be able to compare their results with other strategies/methods/teams."</p><p>The participation of such diverse profiles has allowed the creation of heterogeneous resources, available to the community. Such resources are centralized in the CodiEsp webpage <ref type="foot" coords="19,228.88,472.23,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_9">11</ref> . In this sense, 68.4% of the participant teams indicated that they would provide software or web service based on their system if there is specific technical or financial support, whereas 31.6% were not interested in assistance to advance their clinical coding system into a software product or startup.</p><p>CodiEsp has been a challenging shared task according to the participants. Most of them rated it as difficult or very difficult. However, 78.9% would be interested in participating in a second CodiEsp track. When asked about the time invested, the most common answer has been 1 to 4 weeks, followed by 4 to 10 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="19,211.64,581.63,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</p><p>Possible improvements. One of the CodiEsp limitations has been the Gold Standard size. CodiEsp corpus contains 1,000 annotated clinical case reports, with 16,504 sentences and 396,988 tokens. In the shared task setting, 750 docu-ments were used for learning, and 250 were employed for results evaluation. As previously discussed, some codes present in the test set had not been employed in the training and development sets. Indeed, 1856 codes appear just once in the entire gold standard. Even though several systems achieved high metrics, a more significant Gold Standard would allow more examples for systems to learn from, and a more representative set of documents to evaluate them. An extension of the CodiEsp corpus would now require fewer resources, since the guidelines employed are already publicly available <ref type="bibr" coords="20,309.45,202.68,14.60,8.74" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, as some participants have pointed out, the gold standard of the exploratory subtask CodiEsp-Explainability had a limited inter-annotator agreement. CodiEsp corpus was annotated independently by two clinical experts. On the subset of documents annotated by both experts, they achieved an IAA of 80.5% for annotating the textual references that justify the code assignment. Arguably, a higher IAA would have resulted in more top metrics in the CodiEsp-Explainability subtask.</p><p>These two limitations, gold standard size and consistency in the text evidence annotation, should act to spur future research groups to extend the CodiEsp corpus. Most participants(78.9%) reported interest in a second CodiEsp edition. Additionally, annotation guidelines are already publicly available, together with the entire CodiEsp corpus, CodiEsp abstracts corpus, and many other resources employed by participants to tune their systems. A second CodiEsp edition could make use of these materials to further promote clinical coding in Spanish.</p><p>Closing remarks. The task has been relevant not only in terms of determining the most competitive approaches for this particular data and track, but it also explains how to generate new clinical coding tools for other languages and data collections. The former includes participant systems that are open source and the baseline, all compiled in the CodiEsp webpage 12 .

The division of the CodiEsp corpus into training, development, and test set was performed using randomly generated non-overlapping samples. Since the ICD-10 terminology has more than 170.000 distinct codes, some codes present in test documents were not covered previously by training or development set annotations. When evaluating systems using only the subset of codes present in training and development sets, all evaluation scores increase considerably. In the Figure5, this effect is clearly observed.
