<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In clinical practice, considerable amounts of text data (e.g., discharge summaries, radiology reports, and other narrative components of electronic health records) are created every day. Such data are managed using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for reporting diagnosis and statistical comparisons of morbidity and mortality. ICD is a medical classification provided by the World Health Organization, and it assigns a unique alphanumeric code to diseases, injuries, signs, procedures, and symptoms.</p><p>Although ICD codes are widely used for statistical analysis, decision-making, and even for reimbursement, manual ICD coding is time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, automatic ICD coding is in high demand.</p><p>Automatic ICD coding <ref type="bibr" coords="1,252.33,590.97,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,269.49,590.97,12.73,8.74" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,283.88,590.97,12.73,8.74" target="#b18">19]</ref> is the prediction of suitable ICD codes on the basis of an input document. As a type of multilingual information extraction, the CLEF eHealth community has been organizing shared tasks on ICD coding since 2016. Furthermore, several methods have been proposed using topic modeling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.72,130.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, pattern matching <ref type="bibr" coords="2,273.43,130.95,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,290.58,130.95,11.62,8.74" target="#b10">11]</ref>, information retrieval-style ranking <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.32,130.95,14.61,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,274.66,142.90,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,286.84,142.90,7.75,8.74" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,296.25,142.90,11.62,8.74" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT)-based models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.70,154.86,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.87,154.86,11.62,8.74" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the approach of TeamX for the ICD10-CM<ref type="foot" coords="2,456.66,165.74,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and ICD10-PCS<ref type="foot" coords="2,189.18,177.69,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> coding to Spanish clinical cases at CLEF eHealth 2020 Task 1 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,470.07,179.27,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,191.22,11.62,8.74" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The organizers prepared a CodiEsp corpus of 1,000 clinical cases in Spanish. This corpus was manually assigned ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS codes by clinical coding professionals meeting strict quality criteria.</p><p>We found the following difficulties in the CLEF eHealth 2020 ICD coding task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The CodiEsp corpus has a large number of words per document: In the</head><p>CodiEsp corpus, the average number of words per document is approximately 396.2. In contrast, those in the CépiDc, KSH-HU, and ISTST-IT datasets <ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.23,297.32,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are 10.0, 7.9, and 46.0, respectively <ref type="foot" coords="2,360.56,295.75,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Compared with the other corpora in CLEF eHealth, the CodiEsp corpus has the largest number of words per document. In 2018, the seq2seq model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.50,321.23,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> achieved the best performance. This model learns the document embedding by encoding sequences with a recurrent neural network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,324.83,345.14,15.50,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and predicts the code sequences from this embedding. However, when processing long documents such as the CodiEsp Corpus, it is difficult to encode the documents into a single, fixed-size representation using an RNN or BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,368.36,381.01,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. 2. There is a large number of codes: In general ICD coding, suitable codes must be predicted from a large number of codes (ICD10-CM and ICD10-PCS have approximately 87,000 and 98,000 types of codes for this task, respectively).</p><p>In previous methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.95,429.33,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.13,429.33,11.62,8.74" target="#b17">18]</ref>, ICD coding was considered as a multi-label classification (MLC); however, it is usually difficult to learn a classification model with a large label space because the labels are highly imbalanced.</p><p>Considering the features mentioned above, we propose a model based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.74,486.61,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.90,486.61,11.62,8.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Our method has three main aspects:</p><p>1. N-gram encoder : In the CodiEsp corpus, the number of words per document is large, and the ICD code is annotated into token N-grams. Therefore, we introduce an N-gram encoder to learn an N-gram representation rather than encoding the entire document into a single, fixed-size representation. 2. Code-filtering strategy: It is difficult to learn an ICD coding model as an MLC with a large label space. Therefore, we introduce a strategy to reduce the label space by limiting the number of target codes. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,134.77,302.51,27.89,7.89">Fig. 1.</formula><p>Example of annotated data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">N-gram encoder</head><p>In the annotated texts, the ICD codes correspond to words or phrases that denote diseases, injuries, signs, symptoms, or procedures. We assume that N-gram representations in an input document are effective features for code prediction. An N-gram encoder learns N-gram embeddings from an input document using a convolutional neural network <ref type="bibr" coords="4,272.64,411.63,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (CNN):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,272.42,434.78,208.17,9.68">D 1 = CNN(X),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where X ∈ R n×d is a trainable document feature matrix initialized with pretrained word embeddings, n is the number of words in the input document, and d is the embedding size of the words. Moreover, CNN returns an N-gram feature matrix D 1 ∈ R (n-s+1)×u , where s is the window size of the convolution filters (the size of the word-level N-gram), and u is the number of convolution filters. Each column of D 1 represents an N-gram features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Code encoder</head><p>We utilize the code descriptions to learn the code embeddings. The code embedding matrix, L 2 ∈ R C×d , is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,232.95,609.00,243.39,9.68">L 2 = tanh(dropout(L 1 )W 1 + b 1 ).

Here, W 1 ∈ R d×d and b 1 ∈ R d are trainable parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Code-wise attention</head><p>We introduce a code-wise attention mechanism that learns the relevance between N-grams and ICD codes. First, we pass the N-gram features, D 1 , to a feedforward network as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,252.32,183.88,228.27,9.68">D 2 = tanh(D 1 W 2 + b 2 ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where W 2 ∈ R u×d and b 2 ∈ R d are trainable parameters. Next, we calculate the code-wise attention matrix:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,260.23,236.70,220.37,12.69">A = softmax(D 2 L T 1 ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where A ∈ R (n-s+1)×C represents the relevance between each N-gram and each ICD code. Finally, we calculate a weighted document feature matrix, D 3 ∈ R C×d , and a score vector, Y ∈ R C , for each ICD code:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="5,270.03,303.52,206.32,11.72">D 3 = relu(A T D 2 ), (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="5,254.09,305.59,226.50,25.56">) Y = sigmoid(D 3 • L T 2 ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where • denotes the inner product.</p><p>In the testing phase, our model ranks the ICD codes using the predicted scores and removes the codes with a score below pre-defined threshold t from the ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Weighted BCE</head><p>We consider the ICD coding as an MLC and therefore naturally use the BCE as a loss function. However, we should be careful when the numbers of positive and negative samples in the ground truth Ŷ are significantly imbalanced because there are many types of ICD codes. If the MLC model is trained using the standard BCE, the trained model predicts a low score for all the codes because the elements of Ŷ are almost zero (negative). To alleviate this problem, we introduce a weight variable, w p , for a positive sample into the BCE. We train our model using weighted BCE as a loss function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="5,202.03,530.85,274.32,30.32">Loss = - 1 C C ∑ i=1 w p y i log( ŷi ) + (1 -y i )log(1 -ŷi ), (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="5,476.35,541.26,4.24,8.74">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="5,243.29,564.80,233.05,22.31">w p = NEGATIVE COUNTS POSITIVE COUNTS , (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11" coords="5,476.35,571.54,4.24,8.74">)</formula><p>where ŷi ∈ {0, 1} and y i ∈ [0, 1] are the ground truth and predicted score for the i-th code, respectively. POSITIVE COUNTS represents the number of elements with a value of 1 in Ŷ , and NEGATIVE COUNTS is the number of elements with a value of 0 in Ŷ . The weighted BCE returns a higher loss value than the standard BCE if the model predicts a low score for the appropriate ICD code during training. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Code-filtering strategy</head><p>In this task, the model must predict suitable codes from the input document. It is usually difficult to learn a classification task with a large label space. Therefore, we apply two code-filtering strategies, AND and OR, to reduce this space.</p><p>Here, AND is a strategy using which our model predicts only the ICD codes included in both the training and development sets, and OR is a strategy with which our model predicts only the ICD codes included in either the training or development set. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,254.70,406.01,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the number of ICD codes applied to each code-filtering strategy. The code size C depends on the strategy applied.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" coords="6,260.22,529.10,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> lists the hyperparameters of our model. As a baseline, we built a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF)based method. First, as the baseline, the word-level TFIDF scores from the CodiEsp corpus and the code descriptions are calculated, and L2 normalization is then applied to each TFIDF vector. Second, the cosine similarity between the TFIDF vector of the input document and that of each code description is calculated. Finally, the codes with a similarity are ranked, and the codes with </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results and discussion</head><p>We trained the model for 100 epochs and selected the best model of the development data for the testing. We used MAP to evaluate the model. Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,180.74,601.14,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="7,207.82,601.14,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref> show the experimental results of the ICD10-PCS and ICD10-CM codes, respectively. Our method outperforms the TFIDF-based method as a baseline. The MAP of the AND strategy is higher than that of the OR strategy in both the ICD10-PCS and ICD10-CM codes. It can be seen that the strategy of limiting the target code is effective for this task. As a future study, we are also interested in a frequency-based or MAP-maximizing strategy.</p><p>Comparing the weighted BCE and the standard BCE setting, the weighted BCE is more effective. In particular, we observed a large elongation in the ICD10-CM dataset (Table <ref type="table" coords="8,225.03,178.85,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Because the ICD10-CM dataset has a larger number of codes even with the AND strategy (Table <ref type="table" coords="8,345.20,190.80,4.43,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and exhibits a higher data imbalance, as described in Section 3.4, the weighted BCE proved to be effective.</p></div>
