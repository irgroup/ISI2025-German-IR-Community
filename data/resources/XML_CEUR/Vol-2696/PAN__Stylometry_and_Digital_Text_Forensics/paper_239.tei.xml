<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stylistic features</head><p>In determining the age or gender of a writer, it is important to consider functional words, such as prepositions, pronouns and determiners. These attributes have been shown to be effective in detecting an author's profile. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.22,303.83,71.78,9.05" target="#b5">[Cruz et al., 2013]</ref>. In other work, the authors use the frequency of punctuation marks, the frequency of capital letters and citations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,120.50,326.97,84.19,8.96">[Aleman et al., 2013]</ref>. Similarly, HTML attributes, such as image URLs or a web page link, have been used by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.17,338.49,86.49,8.96" target="#b6">[Sapkota et al., 2013]</ref>. In the work of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,378.31,338.49,76.85,8.96">[Patra et al., 2013]</ref> the authors are based on specific terms (foreign words) for the distinction between the authors. Similarly, other authors use a calculation of the frequency of emoticons as a discriminating attribute for the prediction of the authors <ref type="bibr" coords="2,345.99,372.93,72.43,8.96" target="#b7">[Irazu et al., 2013]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Content features</head><p>In addition to the style used, the occurrence of the themes used can differentiate several age categories. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.17,423.47,89.58,8.96" target="#b4">[Argamon et al., 2009]</ref>.</p><p>The age of groups generally represents adolescents, young people and adults. Adolescents were grouped in the '10s' category presenting individuals between 13 and 17 years of age, young people in the '20s' category representing those between 23 and 27 years of age and finally adults in the '30s' category representing those aged between 33 and 47 years <ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.92,486.95,77.26,8.96" target="#b8">[Schler et al., 2006]</ref>.</p><p>The work carried out by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.25,504.47,50.70,8.96">Koppel et al.</ref> have shown that at the gender level. Men prefer to categorize things using more determinants (le / la, ce / ce, un / une, etc.) and quantifiers (two, more, few, etc.). On the other hand, women frequently use personal pronouns in their writings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.48,538.91,66.21,8.96">(I, you, me, etc.)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="2,245.35,538.91,81.22,8.96" target="#b3">[Koppel et al., 2003]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,131.90,556.43,92.39,8.96" target="#b4">Argamon et al.

For their part, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,325.62,579.50,88.63,8.96">[Nguyen et al., 2013]</ref> have tried to predict age in the conversations of Dutch Twitter users. They used traits from the language model combined with parts of speech. 74% of the discussions were well classified. They obtained an average margin of error between 4.1 and 6.8 years for age prediction. Similarly, in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.24,625.46,99.63,8.96">[Zhang and Zhang, 2010]</ref>, the authors worked on blog segments using word-type features, punctuations, average words per sentence, length of sentences, part of speech and the rate of prediction of the gender which amounts to 72%. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,431.69,648.50,38.68,8.96;2,120.50,660.02,52.47,8.96" target="#b9">Peersman et al.

The average obtained for the prediction of age and gender is 88% <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.18,671.42,42.00,8.96;2,120.50,682.94,45.98,8.96" target="#b9">[Peersman et al., 2011]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,147.24,149.58,85.40,8.96">[Gaustad et al., 2007]</ref>, the authors are interested in the automatic classification of mails. They obtained an accuracy rate of 81% for gender and 72% for age. We cite among others, the work of <ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.69,172.62,71.75,8.96">[Kose et al., 2007]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,308.97,172.62,89.89,8.96" target="#b11">[Hariharan et al, 2011]</ref> which have shown promising results in detecting the author's gender in instant discussions. For their part, Maharjan et al. have developed a system based entirely on the Map Reduce technique for predicting age and gender. This technique is a parallel programming model allowing the processing of a very large mass of data (Big data). These real-time programs are executed on partitions (clusters) and are automatically parallelized <ref type="bibr" coords="3,405.57,230.10,69.14,8.96;3,124.82,241.65,21.54,8.96" target="#b2">[Maharjan et al., 2014]</ref>. This system which employs a large number of functionalities is capable of performing the prediction task in a fraction of time with good details. This approach demonstrates that the use of these systems can be a perfect solution for data quantity problems and / or a large number of attributes.</p><p>The objective of the study by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.31,293.61,78.34,8.96">Rangel et al. (2016)</ref> was to show how people use language to express their emotions and how it can help them identifying their age and gender. They used a graphical approach called "EmoGraph" which allows the text to be represented by a graph of parts of speech labeled by emotions and themes. The authors showed results comparable to those of the best systems presented at the PAN @ CLEF 2013 evaluation conference <ref type="bibr" coords="3,237.63,351.09,80.24,8.96">[Rangel et al., 2016]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Preprocessing</head><p>Plain text should be filtered to remove noisy data, such as HTML tags and urls. This is because the presence of this noisy data could affect and reduce the accuracy of the entire analysis. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.86,456.95,101.95,8.96" target="#b10">[Derczynski et al., 2013]</ref> pointed out that ''twitter text is difficult to part-ofspeech tag: it is noisy, with linguistic errors and idiosyncratic style''. Thus, preprocessing stage is important step. After that the cleaned data is then stored in a database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">text analysis</head><p>In this step, it is a matter of carrying out linguistic and statistical processing to find the useful information allowing to subsequently achieve the best classification of documents. To achieve our objective, we calculated the number of occurrences of all the words that occurred in the corpus and thus obtained a list of words sorted by frequency. Note that the text analysis step is repeated for each age group and for each gender. Then we tried to gather these terms into thematic classes by adopting a semi-automatic annotation which follows the following two steps: -Automatic procedure: During this annotation, we based ourselves on the automatic search of thematic classes for the attributes based on the content and of syntactic classes for the attributes based on the style. Furthermore, the definition of thematic classes is based on the notion of a universe of discourse. Indeed, all the terms presenting a semantic relation are gathered around a centroid which bears the name of this class. In this annotation, we use the Wordnet-Similarity tool to extract the semantic distances between terms. We use synonymy, hypernymy and hypomimy relationships to detect generalization and specification. At the end of this step all the terms having a semantic distance with the "synset" belong to the same class. It should be noted that the stylistic classes are obtained using the morpho-syntactic analyzer in order to be able to differentiate prepositions, verbs, pronouns, etc.</p><p>-Manual procedure: Since the automatic annotation does not allow assigning all the terms found in a class, we have had recourse to the manual annotation which is inspired by the thematic classification proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="4,305.04,230.10,96.38,8.96" target="#b4">[Argamon et al., 2009]</ref>. It consists of manually grouping the most frequent terms in the same class. This operation is performed by three different linguists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Features extraction</head><p>Recent methods differentiate two main categories of features that can be used to predict the profile of the author: Stylistic features and those based on content <ref type="bibr" coords="4,127.58,328.89,76.07,8.96">[Wiegmann, 2019]</ref> .In order to measure the relevance of a term in a given document in the corpus, we used the TF * IDF measure which is calculated as follows: <ref type="bibr" coords="4,127.58,351.93,86.84,8.96">[Buckley et al., 1996]</ref>  After forming the classes, the trait selection is used to elucidate which ones allow better discrimination. This step is essential since the initial calculation of the frequency of terms in the corpus does not provide information on the ability of the classes found to discriminate between the different age / gender categories. In addition, the selection of attributes is a very important factor which eliminates redundant attributes and which results in improved classification performance.</p><p>It should be noted that the selection of attributes can be done in two ways. The first is an "a priori" selection which allows you to filter the attributes before starting the classification step. In this case, it is a question of employing filtering algorithms making it possible to find, for example, the best K most discriminating attributes. As for the second, it is an "a posteriori" selection which exploits the classification process: each time it is a question of using a set of attributes for learning and of refining the results as and when. This iterative process stops when the classification result is optimal. Therefore, the attributes allowing to obtain the best results are retained as the most discriminating attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Classification</head><p>Once the attributes have been defined, the classification of the texts is proceed. It is started with the construction of the two learning matrices relating to the gender and age dimension. However, we have opted to enrich our base of thematic classes. The idea is that each test corpus can contain terms semantically linked to existing terms in the learning corpus. Therefore, expanding these terms is a step towards improving relevance.</p><p>It should be noted that the enrichment of the base of thematic terms is defined as being the process of completing the original terms of the thematic classification proposed by associating them with semantically similar terms. It is one of the solutions envisaged to enrich the proposed classes. Similar the text analysis stage, in this enrichment process, we have based ourselves on the exploitation of semantic links like synonymy, hyponymy or hypernymy for the enrichment process.</p></div>
