<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In our participation in the authorship verification task (small corpus), our main objective is to be able to discriminate between pairs of texts that were written by the same author (denoted "same-author") and pairs of snippets written by different ones ("different-authors"). The paper describes a simple model that performs this task based on a Labbé similarity. As features, we employed the most frequent tokens (words, and punctuation symbols) from each author after including the most frequent ones of a given language. Such a representation strategy is based on word used frequently by a given author but not belonging to the most frequent in the English language. Evaluation based of authorship verification task with a rather small set of features shows an overall performance with the small dataset of F1= 0.705 and AUC = 0.840.</p></div>

In this kind of task, one can also provide a sample of texts written by the proposed author from which the system could generate a better author's profile. This additional sample was not provided in the current experiment.</p><p>For the CLEF PAN 2020 (small corpus), the pairs of texts have been extracted from the website www.fanfiction.net storing texts about numerous well-known novels, movies or TV series (e.g., Harry Potter, Twilight, Bible) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,389.58,535.93,11.62,9.65" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These writings called fanfics have been scripted not by the true author(s) but by fans who want to continue or propose a new episode for their preferred saga. Of course, such a fan could have written for different series or propose several variants for continuing a specific one. One can however assume that a writer is more interested to script in a given topic or domain (called fandom, a subculture of fans sharing a common interest on a given subject).</p><p>Thus for the proposed task, the question is to identify whether or not a pair of text excerpts have been authored by the same person. We view this author verification as a similarity detection problem, or to detect when a similarity between two texts is too high to reflect two distinct authors.</p><p>Just like in authorship attribution, the author of a given text had to be revealed by identifying some of his/her stylistic idiosyncrasies and to measure the similarity between two author's profile. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.60,195.85,11.71,9.65" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Suggest using quantification of writing style in texts to represent the identity of their authors. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.01,207.37,11.59,9.65" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Makes use of emojis in the feature selection for verification of twitter users. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,259.54,218.89,11.74,9.65" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Applies large numbers of linguistic information such as vocabulary, lexical patterns, syntax, semantics, information content, and item distribution through a text for author recognition and verification.</p><p>As possible application of author verification, one can mention analysis of anonymous emails for forensic investigations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.68,264.85,10.69,9.65" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, verification of historical literature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,456.48,264.85,10.69,9.65" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, continuous authentication used in cybersecurity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,323.16,276.37,10.68,9.65" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, detection of changes in writing styles with Alzheimer patients <ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.19,287.89,10.69,9.65" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the text datasets while Section 3 describes the features used for the classification. Section 4 explains the similarity measure and Section 5 depicts some of our evaluation results. A conclusion draws the main findings of our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus</head><p>The corpus contains a set of pairs composed of two short texts (or snippets) describing proposed variants or continuation of a series achieving a popular success. In this context, given two snippets, the task is to determine whether the text pair has been written by a single author or by two distinct writers. This question is a stylistic similarity detection problem assuming that two snippets could cover distinct topics with very distinctive characters and temporal differences but still being written by the same person.</p><p>These pairs of texts have been extracted from different domains (fandoms) and Table <ref type="table" coords="2,148.68,491.20,4.98,9.65">1</ref> reports some examples of such fandoms with the number of texts extracted from them.</p><p>('G-Gundam', 56), ('Vampire Knight', 175), ('Free! -Iwatobi Swim Club', 121), ('DC Superheroes', 98), ('Friends', 111), ('CSI: Miami', 133), ('Grimm', 108), ('Danny Phantom', 200), ('Primeval', 117), ('Kingdom Hearts', 219), ('Jurassic Park', 107), ('Tarzan', 40), ('Dungeons and Dragons', 73), ('Final Fantasy X', 152), ('Fast and the Furious', 112), ('OZ', 33), ('Sons of Anarchy', 115), ('Avatar: Last Airbender', 223), ('Attack on Titan', 194), ('Madam Secretary', 47) Table <ref type="table" coords="2,161.88,610.21,3.90,9.86">1</ref>: Examples sample fandom and number of times they appear in the pairs. This corpus contains 52,590 text pairs (denoted problems) from which 27,823 pairs corresponding to the same author and 24,767 are pairs written by two distinct persons. Each text excerpt contains, in mean, 2,200 word-tokens. An example of a pair is provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,197.04,668.18,4.98,9.65" target="#tab_0">2</ref> with their respective length and their vocabulary size. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Feature Selection</head><p>To determine the authorship of the two text chunks, we need to specify a text representation that can characterize the stylistic idiosyncrasies of each possible author. As a simple first solution, and knowing that only a small text size is available, we will focus on the most frequent word-types.</p><p>To generate a text representation, a tokenization must be defined. In this study, a token is a sequence of letters delimited by space or punctuation symbols. We also consider as token the punctuation marks (or sequence of them) such as comma, full stop, or question marks. Words appearing the nltk stopword list are included in this representation (179 entries composed of pronouns, determiners, auxiliary verb forms, some conjunctions and prepositions). Thus our strategy is based on word-types used recurrently by one author but not frequent in the underlying language (English in this case). One can compare this solution to the Zeta model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,349.71,547.69,15.41,9.65" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.40,547.69,15.43,9.65" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Then to determine the most frequent ones, the occurrence frequency (or term frequency denoted tf) of each word-type inside a chunk of text is computed. However, as each text chunk has a different size and we opt for a relative term frequency (rtf) computed as the term frequency divided by the text size. One can interpret this rtf value as an estimation of the probability of occurrence of the term in the underlying snippet. Finally, each pair is represented by the rtf of the k most frequent word-types, with k varying from 100 to 400.</p><p>Based on a vector of k elements reflecting the rtf of each selected word-type, the similarity (or distance) between the two text excerpts can be computed. In this study, we opt for the Labbé similarity <ref type="bibr" coords="4,253.07,200.65,15.43,9.65" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This measure is normalized and returns a value between zero (nothing in common) and one (vectors are identical). All pairs of snippets with similarity above a given threshold (denoted δ) are considered to be authored by the same person. On the other hand, a similarity value lower than the specified threshold indicates different authors.</p><p>Denoting by d1 and d2 two document vectors, the Labbé distance corresponds to the ratio of the absolute difference of all n terms to the to the maximal distance between the two text representations as shown in equation 1.</p></div>

For each term in the document, the difference between the absolute frequencies in Text 𝑑𝑑 1 and 𝑑𝑑 2 is computed. This requires both documents to have equal length. To ensure that both text have similar length, assuming Text 𝑑𝑑 1 (𝑛𝑛 𝑑𝑑1 ) is larger than Text 𝑑𝑑 2 (𝑛𝑛 𝑑𝑑2 ), we multiply the relative term frequency of Text 𝑑𝑑 1 (𝑟𝑟𝑤𝑤𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖,1 ) with the ratio of the two lengths 𝑛𝑛 𝑑𝑑1 and 𝑛𝑛 𝑑𝑑2 as shown in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="4,358.08,454.45,3.77,9.65" target="#formula_0">1</ref>.</p><p>During the PAN CLEF 2020 author verification task, the system must return a value between 0.0 and 1.0 for each problem. In our case, the Labbé similarity score provide this value. In addition, we must specify "same-author", "different-authors" or provide a blank answer (meaning " I don't know") that will be considered as an unanswered question during the evaluation. Specify δ = 0.5 (see Equation <ref type="formula" coords="4,381.11,512.77,3.63,9.65" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), we ignore this last possible answer and we provide an answer to all problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>As a performance measure, four evaluation indicators have been used. First, the AUC (area under the curve) is computed. This value corresponds to area under the curve generated according to the percentage of false positives (or false alarms) in the xaxis and the percentage of true positive cases in the y-axis over the entire test set. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong obtains an AUC of 0.0; one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0.</p><p>Second the F1 combines the precision and the recall into a unique value. In this computation, the non-answers are ignored. Third, c@1 is a variant of the conventional F1 score which rewards systems leaving difficult problems unanswered. It takes into account both the number of correct answers and the number of problems left unsolved <ref type="bibr" coords="5,336.69,149.89,15.45,9.65" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Four, F_0.5_u is a measure according more emphasis when the system is able to solve the same-author cases correctly <ref type="bibr" coords="5,159.95,172.93,15.62,9.65" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The entire system was based on only the training set, so the training and the evaluation was done directly on the same corpus. With 52,590 problems in the ground truth, the results of the similarity verification are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,385.92,210.37,3.76,9.65" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. Increasing the number of features from 100 to 500 does not have a significant impact on the overall results as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,289.93,416.17,3.76,9.65" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. On the other hand, the run time is clearly increasing. To have a better view of the results, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,316.44,149.89,4.98,9.65" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the distribution of the Labbé similarity values for the two classes, namely "same -author" and "different authors" (k=100). As one can see, the "same-author" distribution (in blue) presents a higher (mean: 0.723, sd: 0.041) and the distribution is more on the right (higher value) compared to the "different authors" distribution (mean: 0.660, sd: 0.048) and shown in red. However, the intersection between the two distribution is relatively large.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,158.52,230.05,82.98,9.65">k AUC c</formula><p>In a last experiment, instead of building the text representation with all possible word-types, we remove the 179 most frequent word appearing in the nltk stopword list.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>Due to time constraint, this report proposes a simple text similarity technique to solve the authorship verification problem when facing with pairs of snippets. We proposed to select features by ranking them according to their frequency of occurrence in each text and taking only the most frequent ones (from 100 to 500) but in including the most frequent ones in the underlying language. With this proposed strategy, we want to identify terms occurring frequently by an author and frequent in the current language (English in this study).</p><p>The similarity computation is based on the Labbé between two vectors. The next step for us is to explore the reverse text representation, taking account only of the most frequent terms of a given language <ref type="bibr" coords="6,268.57,628.60,15.44,9.65" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Of course, one could then combine the two results to hopefully improve the overall effectiveness.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,165.60,644.04,265.40,9.86;5,219.60,655.56,157.63,9.65;5,136.10,436.69,346.91,187.25"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Distribution of the similarity values for the two classes, same author or distinct authors (k=100)</figDesc><graphic coords="5,136.10,436.69,346.91,187.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
