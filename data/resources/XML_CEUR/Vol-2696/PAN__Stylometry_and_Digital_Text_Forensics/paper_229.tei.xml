<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Due to the growth of social media and technological advancement people tend to spend more time on smart devices and are more inclined to get news and updates through social media, that makes people more exposed to fake news and wide scale misinformation. Fake news has been spreading in the form of reviews <ref type="bibr" coords="1,378.54,434.25,16.52,8.64" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, advertisements <ref type="bibr" coords="1,459.88,434.25,16.57,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, political agendas, news articles, rumours and satires <ref type="bibr" coords="1,350.73,446.20,11.12,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> through both social <ref type="bibr" coords="1,446.32,446.20,15.94,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and mainstream electronic mediums. Its extensive use for misleading information, false persuasion and confusion makes it a major threat for public trust on online activities i.e. social community activities, online shopping and positive media reinforcements. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the task natural language processing researchers have contributed to multiple solutions to the problem. Variety, Velocity, Volume and Time Latency of the fake news articles are the four fundamental problems <ref type="bibr" coords="1,463.99,517.93,16.60,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref> encountered by the current academic researchers.</p><p>It has been established through previous researches that linguistic-based features from the news are insufficient <ref type="bibr" coords="1,254.08,554.23,14.98,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, meanwhile, auxiliary features such as past credibility of the author and spread pattern play a vital role in the detection of fake news. We participated in the PAN 2020 author profiling task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,334.96,578.14,15.92,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="1,350.87,578.14,15.92,8.64" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the challenge was to determine if the authors from Twitter are keen to spread fake news. The best obtained results of the English data set is provided, where several machine learning techniques were applied(Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision tree, Multi-Layer Perceptron, KNN) and deep learning(LSTM, Bi-LSTM with and without attention) to determine the best possible results on the validation set. Best model was submitted (Bi-LSTM with attention) where 70% accuracy was obtained on the test set.</p><p>In the following section, the existing work in the research community is described. In section 3, corpora provided by the PAN organizers and task description are presented. In section 4, details of our purposed approach and experiments to evaluate the system are described. In section 5, results and analysis are stated. Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Fake news on social media can either be created by bots <ref type="bibr" coords="2,369.53,249.87,16.60,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or real humans. Many bots are created solely to spread misinformation, rumors, spam and can be easily confused with human behaviour. One of the key aspects used as an indicator is social context <ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.90,285.73,16.65,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and distribution pattern of real and fake news. The online users work as a social community to dominate the speed of fake news. Broadly speaking fake news have been studied based on multiple theoretical perspectives including style of the content <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.56,321.60,15.27,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, propagation of fake news <ref type="bibr" coords="2,278.92,321.60,11.62,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and role , engagement and attributes of user in creating fake news <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.91,333.55,16.60,8.64" target="#b14">[15]</ref> [1] [7] <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.21,333.55,15.27,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We also see that language variety and cultural idiosyncrasies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.58,345.51,16.23,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref> can influence tasks like author profiling in establishing discourse. Some of the approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.75,357.46,17.55,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to tackle these issues have been fact checking with the aid of experts, machine learning algorithm, information comparisons etc. Unique emotional patterns <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.13,381.37,11.77,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and signals <ref type="bibr" coords="2,253.04,381.37,16.10,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref> between fake news and real news is also studies as manipulation requires emotional language cues <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.13,393.33,11.93,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Researcher have used supervised techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.43,405.28,16.66,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref>[5] like Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Decision Trees repeatedly to detect deception and fraud in text. Supervised deep learning models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.31,417.24,17.32,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>[6] <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.62,417.24,17.32,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref> like Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), Bidirectional LSTM and Recurrent Neural networks(RNN) have also shown substantial results by having the ability to capture contextual information in news. It has also been discussed that instead of emphasising on claims, the news sources <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.34,465.06,16.90,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref> can provide more valuable insights on fake news. The context between creators analysis and content analyses of the news give rise to the authorship profiling task of fake news.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dataset</head><p>PAN-2020 provided 30,000 labeled tweets of English language to train and develop the systems. Training corpus consisted of 24,000 labeled tweets, and 6,000 labeled tweets for the development phase (according to the PAN's suggested split of 70 percent for training and 20 percent for testing the models). Evaluation test set had 200 files with 100 tweets per file. Different annotators manually labeled the corpora. More details can be found in overview papers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology</head><p>We conducted experiments using several machine learning and deep learning methods. For all machine learning methods(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, De-cision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbor), we used CountVectorizer and Tf-Idf transformer to create feature input vectors. In our deep learning methods, we used 50D Twitter GloVe embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="3,279.50,143.22,17.93,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Below, details and features of our final deep learning model are mentioned that was submitted in the PAN 2020 task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Pre-Processing</head><p>As mentioned in the literature review, fake news needs to preserve stylistic features in the tweet to be able to record information that can add value in evaluation. Hence, we used Ekphrasis <ref type="bibr" coords="3,196.39,224.72,11.62,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for the converting all the stylistic information into unique tags before passing it into our deep learning model. We converted number, URL, email address, currency, username, time, date, hashtag, elongated text, all capital text and repeated and emphasised texts special tags to preserve meaningful information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Setup and Evaluation</head><p>Our final model with highest accuracy was Bi-LSTM with attention <ref type="bibr" coords="3,402.57,306.21,15.27,8.64" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The Bi-LSTM approach handles the local context from both end to beginning and beginning to end, and attention puts more focus to the information directed by the hidden layer of Bi-LSTM. The model was trained till 8 epochs, the hidden layers were set to size 50, dropout was set to 0.2 and "AdaGradTrainer" was selected. The evaluation score was obtained as described in the task by computing individual accuracy of the users for binary classification. The individual accuracy of all users were than averaged to achieve the final score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>We present the results on evaluation set for all the used algorithms. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,430.64,441.50,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows that the highest accuracy was 79.7% which was achieved by B-LSTM with attention. Highest accuracy among the machine learning algorithm was 78.2% through logistic regression which is very close to our best model. Both decision tree and logistic regression achieved better scores than LSTM and Bi-LSTM respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we analysed multiple machine learning and deep learning algorithms to obtain the highest accuracy for detecting fake news patterns among authors. For our final model, we first preserved the stylistic information in the tweets through Ekphrasis tagging of features, then we created 50D GloVe embeddings and trained it on Bi-LSTM with attention. In the end evaluation testing set on TIRA showed 70% accuracy on our highest achieving model. The evaluation phase showed many machine learning algorithms worked well when trained with Tf-Idf and count vectorizers. In future, we would like to experiment with transformer methods and more diverse features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,204.34,521.48,206.68,109.84"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Accuracy achieved on validation set</figDesc><table coords="3,204.34,521.48,206.68,98.98"><row><cell>Model</cell><cell>Accuracy (Validation set)</cell></row><row><cell>Logistic Regression</cell><cell>78.2</cell></row><row><cell>SVM</cell><cell>72.2</cell></row><row><cell>Decision Tree</cell><cell>76.7</cell></row><row><cell>Multilayer perceptron</cell><cell>68.0</cell></row><row><cell>KNN</cell><cell>74.7</cell></row><row><cell>LSTM</cell><cell>74.2</cell></row><row><cell>Bi-LSTM</cell><cell>76.1</cell></row><row><cell>Bi-LSTM with Self-Attention</cell><cell>79.7</cell></row></table></figure>
