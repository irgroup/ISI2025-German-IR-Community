<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present an overview of the eighth edition of the tasks a and b of the BioASQ challenge, which ran as a lab in the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2020. BioASQ aims at promoting methodologies and systems for large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering through the organization of yearly challenges since 2012. These shared tasks offer to teams around the world the opportunity to develop and compare their methods on the same benchmark datasets that represent the demanding information needs of biomedical experts. This year, apart from introduction of a new task on medical semantic indexing in Spanish (MESINESP8), the eighth versions of the two established BioASQ tasks on semantic indexing (8a) and question answering (8b) in English were also offered. In total, 34 teams with more than 100 systems participated in the three tasks of the challenge, with seven of them focusing on task 8a and 23 on task 8b. As in previous versions of the tasks, the evaluation of system responses reveals some participating systems managed to outperform the strong baselines, indicating that continuous advancements in state-of-the-art systems keep pushing the frontier of research leading to performance improvements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper presents the shared tasks 8a and 8b of the eighth edition of the BioASQ challenge in 2020, the corresponding datasets and the approaches and achieved results of the participating systems. A detailed description of the new task on medical indexing in Spanish is offered in the MESINESP task overview. A condensed BioASQ 2020 Lab overview <ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.94,614.85,10.51,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> is also available, describing the eighth edition the BioASQ challenge as a whole, in the context of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2020. Towards this direction, in section 2 we provide an overview of the shared tasks 8a and 8b, that took place from February to May 2020, as well as the corresponding datasets developed for training and testing the participating systems. In section 3, we briefly overview the participating systems and the approaches proposed by the corresponding teams for these two tasks. Detailed descriptions for some of the systems are also available in the proceedings of the BioASQ lab. In section 4, we present the results of the evaluation of participating systems, based on manual assessment or state-of-the-art evaluation measures, depending on the nature of the required system response. Finally, we conclude and discuss the eighth version of the BioASQ tasks a and b in section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of the Tasks</head><p>In the eighth version of the BioASQ challenge were offered three tasks: (1) a large-scale biomedical semantic indexing task (task 8a), (2) a biomedical question answering task (task 8b), both considering documents in English, and (3) a new task on medical semantic indexing in Spanish (task MESINESP). In this section we provide a brief description of the two established tasks (8a and 8b) with focus on differences from previous versions of the challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.98,373.74,14.61,8.74" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. A detailed overview of the initial versions of the tasks and the general structure of BioASQ is also already available <ref type="bibr" coords="2,210.89,397.65,14.61,8.74" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Large-scale semantic indexing -Task 8a</head><p>In Task 8a the aim is to classify articles from the PubMed/MedLine<ref type="foot" coords="2,444.08,453.57,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">4</ref> digital library into concepts of the MeSH hierarchy. In particular, new PubMed articles that are not yet annotated by the indexers in NLM are gathered to form the test sets for the evaluation of the participating systems. Some basic details about each test set and batch are provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,334.58,502.97,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As done in previous versions of the task, the task is divided into three independent batches of 5 weekly test sets each, providing an on-line and large-scale scenario, and the test sets consist of new articles without any restriction on the journal published. The performance of the participating systems is calculated using standard flat information retrieval measures, as well as, hierarchical ones, when the annotations from the NLM indexers become available. As usual, participants have 21 hours to provide their answers for each test set. However, as it has been observed that new MeSH annotations are released in PubMed earlier that in previous years, we shifted the submission period accordingly to avoid having some annotations available from NLM while the task is still running. For training, a dataset of 14,913,939 articles with 12.68 labels per article, on average, was provided to the participants. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Biomedical semantic QA -Task 8b</head><p>Task 8b aims at providing a realistic large-scale question answering challenge offering to the participating teams the opportunity to develop systems for all the stages of question answering in the biomedical domain. Four types of questions are considered in the task: "yes/no", "factoid", "list" and "summary" questions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,433.89,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A training dataset of 3,243 questions annotated with golden relevant elements and answers is provided for the participants to develop their systems. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,475.61,445.85,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents some statistics about the training dataset as well as the five test sets. As in previous versions of the challenge, the task is structured into two phases that focus on the retrieval of the required information (phase A) and answering the question (phase B). In addition, the task is split into five independent bi-weekly batches and the two phases for each batch run during two consecutive days. In each phase, the participants receive the corresponding test set and have 24 hours to submit the answers of their systems. In particular, in phase A, a test set of 100 questions written in English is released and the participants are expected to identify and submit relevant elements from designated resources, including PubMed/MedLine articles, snippets extracted from these articles, concepts and RDF triples. In phase B, the manually selected relevant articles and snippets for these 100 questions are also released and the participating systems are asked to respond with exact answers, that is entity names or short phrases, and ideal answers, that is natural language summaries of the requested information. This year, 34 teams from institutes around the world participated in the three tasks of the challenge with more than 100 distinct systems. Seven of these teams focused on task 8a and 23 on task 8b. As presented in fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,428.85,596.34,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the institutions hosting the teams that participated in tasks 8a and 8b are distributed around the world highlighting the international interest in the tasks. Compared to previous versions of the challenge, we observe a shift towards the most complex question answering task b, where the number of participating teams and systems is increasing during the last years as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="4,395.90,656.12,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Overview of participation</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task 8a</head><p>This year, 7 teams participated in the eighth edition of task a, submitting predictions from 16 different systems in total. Here, we provide a brief overview of those systems for which a description was available, stressing their key characteristics. A summing-up of the participating systems and corresponding approaches is presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,228.44,442.79,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. This year, the LASIGE team from the University of Lisboa, in its "X-BERT BioASQ" system propose a novel approach for biomedical semantic indexing combining a solution based on Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) with a Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tool. In particular, their system is based on X-BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,175.50,656.12,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, an approach to scale BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,310.25,656.12,15.50,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to XMLC, combined with the use of the MER <ref type="bibr" coords="6,177.88,118.99,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> tool to recognize MeSH terms in the abstracts of the articles. The system is structured into three steps. The first step is the semantic indexing of the labels into clusters using ELMo <ref type="bibr" coords="6,291.34,142.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b38">[39]</ref>; then a second step matches the indices using a Transformer architecture; and finally, the third step focuses on ranking the labels retrieved from the previous indices.</p><p>Other teams, improved upon existing systems already participating in previous versions of the task. Namely, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) team, in its "NLM CNN " system enhance the previous version of their "ceb" systems <ref type="bibr" coords="6,170.95,214.64,14.61,8.74" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, based on an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) architecture with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with SentencePiece tokenization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,441.20,226.59,14.61,8.74" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The Fudan University team also builds upon their previous "AttentionXML" <ref type="bibr" coords="6,465.10,238.55,15.50,8.74" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and "DeepMeSH " <ref type="bibr" coords="6,219.05,250.50,15.50,8.74" target="#b37">[38]</ref> systems as well their new "BERTMeSH " <ref type="bibr" coords="6,428.17,250.50,15.50,8.74" target="#b53">[54]</ref> system, which are based on document to vector (d2v) and tf-idf feature embeddings, learning to rank (LTR) and DL-based extreme multi-label text classification, Attention Mechanisms and Probabilistic Label Trees (PLT) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,405.04,286.37,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Finally, this years versions of the "Iria" systems <ref type="bibr" coords="6,294.82,298.32,15.50,8.74" target="#b42">[43]</ref> are also based on the same techniques used by the systems in previous versions of the challenge which are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,173.78,322.23,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Similarly to the previous versions of the challenge, two systems developed by NLM to facilitate the annotation of articles by indexers in MedLine/PubMed, where available as baselines for the semantic indexing task. MTI <ref type="bibr" coords="6,410.88,358.10,15.50,8.74" target="#b30">[31]</ref> as enhanced in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,146.45,370.05,15.50,8.74" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and an extension based on features suggested by the winners of the first version of the task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,218.47,382.01,14.61,8.74" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task 8b</head><p>This version of Task b was tackled by 94 different systems in total, developed by 23 teams. In particular, 8 teams participated in the first phase, on the retrieval of relevant material required for answering the questions, submitting results from 30 systems. In the second phase, on providing the exact and ideal answers for the questions, participated 18 teams with 72 distinct systems. Three of the teams participated in both phases. An overview of the approaches, technologies and datasets used by the teams is provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,341.63,500.70,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and a graphical representation of them as a word cloud, weighted by their frequency in logarithmic scale, is also provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,205.52,524.61,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Only systems for which a description was available is included in this section. Detailed descriptions for some of the systems are available at the proceedings of the workshop.</p><p>The "ITMO" team participated in both phases of the task experimenting in its "pa" systems with differing solutions across the batches. In general, for document retrieval the systems follow an approach with two stages. First, they identify initial candidate articles based on BM25, and then they re-rank them using variations of BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,248.97,608.30,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, fine-tuned for the binary classification task with the BioASQ dataset and pseudo-negative documents. They extract snippets from the top documents and rerank them using biomedical Word2Vec based on cosine similarity with the question. To extract exact answers they use BERT fine-tuned on SQUAD <ref type="bibr" coords="6,190.30,656.12,15.50,8.74" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and BioASQ datasets and employ a post-processing to split the answer for list questions and additional fine-tuning on PubMedQA <ref type="bibr" coords="7,449.54,499.85,15.50,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for yes/no questions. Finally, for ideal answers they generate some candidates from the snippets and their sentences and rerank them using the model used for phase A. In the last batch, they also experiment with generative summarization, developing a model based on BioMed-RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="7,348.01,547.67,15.50,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to improve the readability and consistency of the produced ideal answers.</p><p>Another team participating in both phases of the task is the "UCSD" team with its "bio-answerfinder" system. In particular, for phase A they rely on previously developed Bio-AnswerFinder system <ref type="bibr" coords="7,333.72,596.34,14.61,8.74" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which is also used as a first step in phase B, for re-ranking the sentences of the snippets provided in the test set. For identifying the exact answers for factoid and list questions they experimented on fine-tuning Electra <ref type="bibr" coords="7,301.44,632.21,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and BioBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,389.97,632.21,15.50,8.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref> on SQuAD and BioASQ datasets combined. The answer candidates are then scored considering classification probability, the top ranking of corresponding snippets and number of occurrences. Finally a normalization and filtering step is performed and, for list questions, and enrichment step based on coordinated phrase detection. For yes/no questions they fine-tune BioBERT on the BioASQ dataset and use majority voting. For summary questions, they employ hierarchical clustering, based on weighted relaxed word mover's distance (wRWMD) similarity <ref type="bibr" coords="8,423.80,440.60,15.50,8.74" target="#b33">[34]</ref> to group the top sentences, and select the sentence ranked highest by Bio-AnswerFinder to be concatenated to form the summary.</p><p>The "AUEB " team also participated in both tasks focusing on phase A and briefly experimenting with Phase B. Working on extending their previous topperforming model <ref type="bibr" coords="8,216.25,500.54,14.61,8.74" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, they experimented with graph-node embeddings generated from a biomedical entity co-occurrence graph from publications <ref type="bibr" coords="8,433.63,512.49,14.61,8.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Moreover, they experimented with new ways to encode and retrieve relevant snippets, but concluded that conventional BM25 pre-fetching was more efficient. For Phase B, they worked with exact answer extraction. To this end, they experimented with a SciBERT-based model <ref type="bibr" coords="8,270.82,560.31,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> modelled for cloze-style biomedical machine reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" coords="8,237.40,572.27,15.50,8.74" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (MRC). However, their initial results indicated that the MRC task differs greatly from the exact answer extraction task and they did not pursue this research direction further.</p><p>In phase A, the team from the University of Aveiro participated with its "bioinfo" systems, which consists of a fine-tuned BM25 retrieval model based on ElasticSearch <ref type="bibr" coords="8,196.32,632.21,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, followed by a neural reranking step. For the latter, they use an interaction-based model inspired on the DeepRank <ref type="bibr" coords="8,371.66,644.16,15.50,8.74" target="#b34">[35]</ref> architecture building upon previous versions of their system <ref type="bibr" coords="8,301.20,656.12,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The focus of the improvements was on the sentence splitting strategy, on extracting of multiple relevance signals, and the independent contribution of each sentence for the final score. The "Google" team also participated in phase A, with four distinct systems for document retrieval based on different approaches. In particular, they used a BM25 retrieval model, a neural retrieval model, initialized with BioBERT and trained on a large set of questions developed through Synthetic Query Generation (QGen), and a hybrid retrieval model<ref type="foot" coords="9,263.01,189.15,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">5</ref> based on a linear blend of BM25 and the neural model <ref type="bibr" coords="9,164.54,202.68,14.61,8.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In addition, they also used a reranking model, rescoring the results of the hybrid model with a cross-attention BERT rescorer <ref type="bibr" coords="9,390.92,214.64,14.61,8.74" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>In phase B, this year the "KU-DMIS " team participated on both exact and ideal answers. For exact answers, they build upon their previous BioBERTbased systems <ref type="bibr" coords="9,199.88,251.28,15.50,8.74" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and try to adapt the sequential transfer learning of Natural Language Inference (NLI) to biomedical question answering. In particular, they investigate whether learning knowledge of entailment between two sentence pairs can improve exact answer generation, enhancing their BioBERT-based models with alternative fine-tuning configurations based on the MultiNLI dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="9,462.33,299.10,14.61,8.74" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. For ideal answer generation, they develop a deep neural abstractive summarization model based on BART <ref type="bibr" coords="9,275.62,323.01,15.50,8.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and beam search, with particular focus on pre-processing and post-processing steps. In particular, alternative systems were developed either considering the answers predicted by the exact answer prediction system in their input or not. In the post-processing step, the generated candidate ideal answers for each question where scored using the predicted exact answers and some grammar scores provided by the language check tool<ref type="foot" coords="9,456.05,381.21,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">6</ref> . For factoid and list questions in particular, the BERN <ref type="bibr" coords="9,360.11,394.74,15.50,8.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> tool was also employed to recognize named entities in the candidate ideal answers for the scoring step.</p><p>The "NCU-IISR" team also participated in both parts of phase B, constructing two BioBERT-based models for extracting the exact answer and ranking the ideal answers respectively. The first model is fine-tuned on the BioASQ dataset formulated as a SQuAD-type QA task that extracts the answer span. For the second model, they regard the sentences of the provided snippets as candidate ideal answers and build a ranking model with two parts. First, a BioBERT-based model takes as input the question and one of the snippet sentences and provides their representation. Then, a logistic regressor, trained on predicting the similarity between a question and each snippet sentence, takes this representation and outputs a score, which is used for selecting the final ideal answer.</p><p>The "UoT " team participated with three different DL approaches for generating exact answers. In their first approach, they fine-tune separately two distinct BioBERT-based models extended with an additional neural layer depending on the question type, one for yes/no and one for factoid and list questions together. In their second system, they use a joint-learning setting, where the same BioBERT layer is connected with both the additional layers and jointly trained for all types of questions. Finally, in their third system they propose a multi-task model to learn recognizing biomedical entities and answers to questions simulta-neously, aiming at transferring knowledge from the biomedical entity recognition task to question answering. In particular, they extend their joint BioBERT-based model with simultaneous training on the BC2GM dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="10,396.19,142.90,15.50,8.74" target="#b44">[45]</ref> for recognizing gene and protein entities.</p><p>The "BioNLPer " team also participated in the exact answers part of phase B, focusing on factoids. They proposed 5 BioBERT-based systems, using external feature enhancement and auxiliary task methodologies. In particular, in their "factoid qa model" and "Parameters retrained" systems they consider the prediction of answer boundaries (start and end positions) as the main task and the whole answer content prediction as an auxiliary task. In their "Features Fusion" system they leveraged external features including NER and part-of-speach (POS) extracted by NLTK <ref type="bibr" coords="10,253.78,254.20,15.50,8.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and ScispaCy <ref type="bibr" coords="10,334.10,254.20,15.50,8.74" target="#b32">[33]</ref> tools as additional textual information and fused them with the pre-trained language model representations, to improve answer boundary prediction. Then, in their "BioFusion" system they combine the two methodologies together. Finally, their "BioLabel" system employed the general and biomedical domain corpus classification as the auxiliary task to help answer boundary prediction.</p><p>The "LabZhu" systems participated in phase B as well, with focus on exact answers for the factoid and list questions. They treat answer generation as an extractive machine comprehension task and explore several different pretrained language models, including BERT, BioBERT, XLNet <ref type="bibr" coords="10,371.33,365.50,15.50,8.74" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and SpanBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="10,462.33,365.50,14.61,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. They also follow a transfer learning approach, training the models on the SQuAD dataset, and then fine-tuning them on the BioASQ datasets. Finally, they also rely on voting to integrate the results of multiple models. The "umass czi" team also focused on the exact answer part of phase B, experimenting with unsupervised representation learning approaches in the context of Biomedical QA. In particular, they considered pretrained representations based on BioBERT, SciB-ERT, and BioSentVec <ref type="bibr" coords="10,230.39,449.18,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and experimented with transferring knowledge from the SQuAD and PubMedQA datasets in to the BioASQ 8b QA task. Finally, they also develop a new pre-training method based on a self-supervised de-noising approach. In this method, they first generate a QA dataset randomly replacing entities automatically recognized by PubTator <ref type="bibr" coords="10,339.42,497.00,15.50,8.74" target="#b47">[48]</ref> in PubMed abstracts. Then, train their model on extracting the span of the new entities given the original ones as a queries.</p><p>The "MQ" team, as in past years, focused on ideal answers, approaching the task as query-based summarisation. In some of their systems the retrain their previous classification and regression approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="10,376.19,560.48,15.50,8.74" target="#b29">[30]</ref> in the new training dataset. In addition, they also employ reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) <ref type="bibr" coords="10,261.63,584.39,15.50,8.74" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and two variants to represent the input features, namely Word2Vec-based and BERT-based embeddings. The "DAIICT " team also participated in ideal answer generation, using the standard extractive summarization techniques textrank <ref type="bibr" coords="10,291.72,620.25,15.50,8.74" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and lexrank <ref type="bibr" coords="10,365.53,620.25,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as well as sentence selection techniques based on their similarity with the query. They also modified these techniques investigating the effect of query expansion based on UMLS <ref type="bibr" coords="10,470.08,644.16,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for sentence selection and summarization. Finally, the "sbert" team, also focused on ideal answers. They experimented with different embedding models and multi-task learning in their systems, using parts from previous "MQU " systems for the pre-processing of data and the prediction step based on classification and regression <ref type="bibr" coords="11,375.55,154.86,14.61,8.74" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In particular, they used a Universal Sentence Embedding Model <ref type="bibr" coords="11,333.81,166.81,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (BioBERT-NLI<ref type="foot" coords="11,422.62,165.24,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">7</ref> ) based on a version of BioBERT fine-tuned on the the SNLI <ref type="bibr" coords="11,341.31,178.77,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the MultiNLI datasets as in Sentence-BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="11,216.85,190.72,14.61,8.74" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The features were fed to either a single logistic regression or classification model to derive the ideal answers. Additionally, in a multi-task setting, they trained the model on both the classification and regression tasks, selecting for the final prediction one of them.</p><p>In this challenge too, the open source OAQA system proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="11,434.93,238.55,15.50,8.74" target="#b51">[52]</ref> served as baseline for phase B exact answers. The system which achieved among the highest performances in previous versions of the challenge remains a strong baseline for the exact answer generation task. The system is developed based on the UIMA framework. ClearNLP is employed for question and snippet parsing. MetaMap, TmTool <ref type="bibr" coords="11,221.97,298.32,14.61,8.74" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, C-Value and LingPipe <ref type="bibr" coords="11,345.48,298.32,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are used for concept identification and UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) for concept retrieval. The final steps include identification of concept, document and snippet relevance based on classifier components and scoring and finally ranking techniques.  <ref type="table" coords="11,165.22,558.27,4.13,7.89">5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task 8a</head><p>In Task 8a, each of the three batches were independently evaluated as presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,206.48,637.41,3.87,8.74">5</ref>. Standard flat and hierarchical evaluation measures <ref type="bibr" coords="11,446.44,637.41,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> were used for measuring the classification performance of the systems. In particular, the micro F-measure (MiF) and the Lowest Common Ancestor F-measure (LCA-F) were used to identify the winners for each batch <ref type="bibr" coords="12,400.48,142.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. As suggested by Demšar <ref type="bibr" coords="12,185.05,154.86,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the appropriate way to compare multiple classification systems over multiple datasets is based on their average rank across all the datasets. In this task, the system with the best performance in a test set gets rank 1.0 for this test set, the second best rank 2.0 and so on. In case two or more systems tie, they all receive the average rank. Then, according to the rules of the challenge, the average rank of each system for a batch is calculated based on the four best ranks of the system in the five test sets of the batch. The average rank of each system, based on both the flat MiF and the hierarchical LCA-F scores, for the three batches of the task are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,346.17,250.50,3.87,8.74">5</ref>.</p><p>The results in Task 8a show that in all test batches and for both flat and hierarchical measures, the best systems outperform the strong baselines. In particular, the "dmiip fdu" systems from the Fudan University team achieve the best performance in all three batches of the task. More detailed results can be found in the online results page<ref type="foot" coords="12,291.26,310.20,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">8</ref> . Comparing these results with the corresponding results from previous versions of the task, suggests that both the MTI baseline and the top performing systems keep improving through the years of the challenge, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="12,283.09,347.64,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Task 8b</head><p>Phase A: In the first phase of Task 8b, the systems are ranked according to the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure for each of the four types of annotations, namely documents, snippets, concepts and RDF triples. This year, the calculation of Average Precision (AP) in MAP for phase A was reconsidered as described in the official description of the evaluation measures for Task 8b <ref type="foot" coords="13,460.74,184.06,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">9</ref> . In brief, since BioASQ3, the participant systems are allowed to return up to 10 relevant items (e.g. documents), and the calculation of AP was modified to reflect this change. However, the number of golden relevant items in the last years have been observed to be lower than 10 in some cases, resulting to relatively small AP values even for submissions with all the golden elements. For this reason, this year, we modified the MAP calculation to consider both the limit of 10 elements and the actual number of golden elements. In Tables 6 and 7 some indicative preliminary results from batch 2 are presented. The full results are available in the online results page of Task 8b, phase A<ref type="foot" coords="13,330.05,291.65,7.94,6.12" target="#foot_6">10</ref> . The results presented here are preliminary, as the final results for the task 8b will be available after the manual assessment of the system responses by the BioASQ team of biomedical experts. Phase B: In the second phase of task 8b, the participating systems were expected to provide both exact and ideal answers. Regarding the ideal answers, the systems will be ranked according to manual scores assigned to them by the BioASQ experts during the assessment of systems responses <ref type="bibr" coords="13,429.55,626.59,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> exact answers, which are required for all questions except the summary ones, the measure considered for ranking the participating systems depends on the question type. For the yes/no questions, the systems were ranked according to the macro-averaged F1-measure on prediction of no and yes answer. For factoid questions, the ranking was based on mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and for list questions on mean F1-measure. Some indicative results for exact answers for the third batch of Task 8b are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,339.81,453.28,3.87,8.74">8</ref>. The full results of phase B of Task 8b are available online 11 . These results are preliminary, as the final results for Task 8b will be available after the manual assessment of the system responses by the BioASQ team of biomedical experts.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,181.04,506.87,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_5">5</ref> presents the performance of the top systems for each question type in exact answers during the eight years of the BioASQ challenge. The diagram reveals that this year the performance of systems in the yes/no questions keeps improving. For instance, in batch 3 presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,367.67,542.74,3.87,8.74">8</ref>, various systems manage to outperform by far the strong baseline, which is based on a version of the OAQA system that achieved top performance in previous years. Improvements are also observed in the preliminary results for list questions, whereas the top system performance in factoid questions is fluctuating in the same range as done last year. In general, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,240.89,602.51,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_5">5</ref> suggests that for the latter types of question there is still more room for improvement.   B, exact answer generation, across the eight years of the BioASQ challenge. Since BioASQ6 the official measure for Yes/No questions is the macro-averaged F1 score (macro F1, but accuracy (Acc) is also presented as the former official measure. The results for BioASQ8 are preliminary, as the final results for Task 8b will be available after the manual assessment of the system responses.</p><p>This paper provides an overview of the eighth version of the BioASQ tasks a and b, on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering in English respectively. These tasks, already established through the previous seven years of the challenge, together with the new MESINESP task on semantic indexing of medical content in Spanish, which ran for the first time, consisted the eighth edition of the BioASQ challenge.</p><p>The overall shift of participant systems towards deep neural approaches, already noticed in the previous years, even more apparent this year. Stateof-the-art methodologies have been successfully adapted to biomedical question answering and novel ideas have been investigated. In particular, most of the systems adopted neural embedding approaches, notably based on BERT and BioBERT models, for both tasks. In the QA task in particular, different teams attempted transferring knowledge from general domain QA datasets, notably SQuAD, or from other NLP tasks such as NER and NLI, also experimenting with multi-task learning settings. In addition, recent advancements in NLP, such as XLNet <ref type="bibr" coords="16,167.57,327.13,14.61,8.74" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, BART <ref type="bibr" coords="16,220.74,327.13,15.50,8.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and SpanBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="16,311.42,327.13,15.50,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have also been tested for the tasks of the challenge.</p><p>Overall, as in previous versions of the tasks, the top preforming systems were able to advance over the state of the art, outperforming the strong baselines on the challenging shared tasks offered by the organizers. Therefore, we consider that the challenge keeps meeting its goal to push the research frontier in biomedical semantic indexing and question answering. The future plans for the challenge include the extension of the benchmark data though a communitydriven acquisition process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,134.77,525.04,345.83,7.89;4,134.77,536.03,127.63,7.86;4,134.77,340.45,345.80,169.82"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
