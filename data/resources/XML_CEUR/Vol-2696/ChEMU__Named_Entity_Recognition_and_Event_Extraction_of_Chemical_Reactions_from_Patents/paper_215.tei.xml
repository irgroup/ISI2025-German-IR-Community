<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Chemical Patents are a primary source for information about novel chemicals and chemical reactions. With the increasing volume of such patents, the dissemination of information about these chemicals and chemical reactions has become even more labor and time intensive. This information can be used to discover new chemicals and synthetic pathways <ref type="bibr" coords="1,301.67,518.98,12.98,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="1,314.66,518.98,17.31,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore, informatics tools for automatically extracting information from these documents are more important than ever.</p><p>The process of extracting relevant information from chemical patents has been referred to as chemical reaction detection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,337.87,567.00,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and two of the main steps in this process are identifying the different parts of a chemical reaction within these documents and then identifying the relationships between them. This can be accomplished with Named Entity Recognition (NER) -the automatic labeling of certain spans within text corresponding to specific labels; and Event Extraction (EE) -the automatic classifying and linking entities based on their relationships to each other.</p><p>The CLEF 2020 ChEMU <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.41,142.90,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Task 1 aims to create systems to perform NER over chemical patents as the first step in chemical reaction detection. Specifically, the goal of this task is to automatically identify chemical compounds based on the role they play in a reaction, as well as other relevant information such as yield and temperature. The CLEF 2020 ChEMU Task 2 aims to create systems to perform EE over the entities to identify the individual steps in the reaction.</p><p>In this paper, we describe our participation in the CLEF 2020 ChEMU Task 1 and Task 2 Challenge. For this challenge, we used our python framework MedaCy<ref type="foot" coords="2,134.77,236.97,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> to automatically identify the experimental parameters associated with the reaction including the trigger words used to link the parameters; and RelEx<ref type="foot" coords="2,463.72,248.93,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> to automatically link the trigger words with the experimental parameters to provide the sequence of steps within the reaction. MedaCy contains a number of supervised multi-label sequence classification algorithms for NER. RelEx contains a rule-based and supervised learning-based algorithms to identify relations between entities. Our best models for Task 1 obtained an overall relaxed precision of 0.95 and exact precision of 0.87; relaxed recall of 0.99 and exact recall of 0.86; and relaxed F 1 score of 0.97 and exact F 1 score of 0.87. Our best model for Task 2 obtained an overall precision of 0.80; recall of 0.54; and F 1 score of 0.65.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>This section describes the underlying methodology of our system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Named Entity Recognition and Trigger Detection</head><p>To identify the experimental parameters and triggers from the data, we use MedaCy's bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) output layer implemented in PyTorch <ref type="bibr" coords="3,431.57,476.79,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. LSTMs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,488.75,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> are a type of recurrent neural network. They take the current input example as well as what they have seen in the past as their input. Hence, they have two sources of input: their current state and their past states. This allows them to connect previous observations, such as words in a sentence, and learn dependencies of these words over arbitrarily long distances. They incorporate the functionality to identify what information that should be passed to the next component and what information should not, allowing for only relevant information to be passed on. For bi-directional LSTMs (biLSTMs), data are processed in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which are then fed forward into the same output layer. This allows the system to exploit context in both directions. A linear-chain CRF is used to assign the final class probability. CRFs are a sequence learning algorithm which incorporate the interdependence between labels into model induction and prediction. Therefore, using a CRF output allows the model to use the preceding label predictions to inform what labels are most likely to follow or to occur close together.</p><p>The input to our biLSTM+CRF model in this work is pre-trained word embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="4,188.22,130.95,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> in combination with character embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="4,385.85,130.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These embeddings are concatenated and then passed through the network.</p><p>The word2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="4,213.64,154.86,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> embeddings are derived from a neural network that learns a representation of a word-word co-occurrence matrix. The character embeddings are learned using a biLSTM and concatenated onto the word2vec embeddings.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Task 2: Event Extraction</head><p>To identify the trigger words, we use our NER system medaCy as described above. To identify the chemical arguments between the trigger words and the entities, we use RelEx, a python-based Relation Extraction Framework developed to identify relations between two entities. The framework contains two main components: 1) Rule-based Method and 2) Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)based Method. In this section, we provide a brief overview of each component.</p><p>Rule-based Method. RelEx's rule-based method utilizes the co-location information of the trigger words to determine that, with respect to the entity if the word is referring to the trigger word or not. We use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the closest occurrence of the trigger word on either side of the entity and all the closest occurrences of the trigger words within a sentence. For each entity in the data set, we traverse both sides until the closest occurrence of the trigger word is found using the provided span values of the entities. We  CNNs allow word embeddings to train on the input text itself or use pre-trained word vectors obtained from an external resource. Initially the convolution layer which is a filter learns using the backpropagation algorithm and extracts features from the input. Then the maxpooling layer uses the position information and helps to extract the most significant feature from the output of the convolution filter. Finally the feed-forward layer uses a softmax classifier that performs classification.</p><p>In this work, for each Trigger word-Entity pair we perform a binary classification to identify whether there is a relation between the trigger word and the entity or not. First, we identify and extract the sentence where a Trigger word-Entity pair pair lies and based on where the text spans are located in the sentence, we divide the sentence into segments as follows:</p><p>preceding -tokenized words before the first concept concept 1 -tokenized words in the first concept middle -tokenized words between the 2 concepts concept 2 -tokenized words in the second concept succeeding -tokenized words after the second concept Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,180.36,138.80,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows an abstract view of the construction of the CNN-based model. A segment is represented by a matrix of k * N where k is the dimension of the word embeddings and N is the number of words in a segment. In this work, we use ChemPatent pre-trained word embeddings. We construct separate convolution units for each segment and concatenate before the fixed-length vector is fed to the dense layer that performs the classification. Each convolution unit applies a sliding window that processes the segment and feeds the output to the max-pooling layer to extract important features independent of their location. The output features of the max-pooling layer of each segment are then flattened and concatenated into a vector before feeding it into the fully connected feedforward layer. The vector is finally fed into a softmax layer to perform the binary classification whether the relationship exists or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Experimental Details</head><p>Word Embeddings . We explore two pre-trained word embeddings: 1) ChemPatent embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="6,188.82,331.83,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> trained over a collection of 84,076 full patent documents (1B tokens); and 2) WikiPubmed embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="6,309.92,343.78,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> in our methods.</p><p>MedaCy . We used PyTorch <ref type="bibr" coords="6,268.25,373.55,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for the implementation of the BiLSTM+CRF model. Models were trained for 40 epochs, and optimized using stochastic gradient descent. A window size of 0 generated the best results. Tokenization was conducted using the SpaCy tokenizer. The labels are strictly the entity types.</p><p>RelEx . We used Keras <ref type="bibr" coords="6,248.98,439.18,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the implementation of the CNN architecture. We experimented with different sliding window sizes, filter sizes, loss functions for fine-tuning and in this work, small filter sizes generated best results for small filter sizes. We applied the dropout technique on the output of the convolution layer to regularize the model. We used Adam and rmsprop optimizers to minimize our loss function. We trained the models for 5 -10 epochs to avoid over-fitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Evaluation</head><p>For Tasks 1 and 2, we report the precision, recall, and F 1 scores. Precision is the ratio between correctly predicted mentions over the total set of predicted mentions for a specific entity; recall is the ratio of correctly predicted mentions over the actual number of mentions, and F 1 is the harmonic mean between precision and recall. For Task 1, we report both the exact and relaxed results for each entity category. In exact evaluation, two annotations are equal only if they have the same tag with exactly matching spans. With the relaxed evaluation, two annotations are equal if they share the same tag and their spans overlap with each other.</p><p>In this section, we discuss the results for Task 1 and 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Task 1: Named Entity Recognition</head><p>Results. Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,214.65,194.76,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">3</ref><ref type="table" coords="7,224.45,194.76,3.32,8.74" target="#tab_2">4</ref><ref type="table" coords="7,232.60,194.76,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">5</ref>show the exact and relaxed precision, recall, and F 1 scores obtained over the testing set for identifying the named entities in each of our three runs. Run 1 model was trained over the training data using the biL-STM+CRF with the CheMU Patent embeddings; run 2 model was trained over the training data using the biLSTM+CRF with the WikiPubmed embeddings; and run 3 model was trained over the training and development data combined with the biLSTM+CRF using the WikiPubmed embeddings. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,430.12,266.49,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">6</ref> shows the baseline results using the CRF-based NER system BANNER <ref type="bibr" coords="7,399.79,278.45,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> provided by the organizers and the overall results of each of our runs. Overall, the biLSTM+CRF model trained using patent embeddings returned the best results, obtaining a 96.78% system-wide relaxed F 1 score. This model performed better than baseline for all entity labels except EXAMPLE LABEL, for which it performed almost identically. This model's performance is likely due to the domain-relevant information contained within the embeddings. The best performance for exact evaluation resulted from the model trained over a combination of the training and development sets. However, this model's overall performance was worse than the baseline model. Still, we believe this model's better performance compared to the other models may be due to the increase of volume of data used to train by the addition of the development set.</p><p>Although the exact results for the models performed slightly worse than baseline, each of the models performed better on the relaxed results, with the model trained over patent embeddings performing best. This discrepancy may be due to the way that MedaCy handles entity classification. Within MedaCy, each individual token is given its own label ('O' for unlabelled entities), so for entities with spans long than one token, the entity may have only been partially labelled. For instance, in many cases of the TEMPERATURE label, MedaCy labeled 'C' or ' • C,' excluding the number preceding the temperature symbol. This may also account for why each model performed poorly for the TEMPERATURE label when evaluating in exact mode, but performed well when evaluating in relaxed mode.</p><p>Error Analysis. Confusion matrices for the three runs over the testing dataset are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="8,233.81,584.39,4.98,8.74">3</ref><ref type="figure" coords="8,243.42,584.39,3.32,8.74">4</ref><ref type="figure" coords="8,251.36,584.39,3.87,8.74">5</ref>. Rows in the matrix represent annotated entities and columns represent predicted entities. For instance, in 3, YIELD OTHER (Y.O) was misidentified as YIELD PERCENT (Y.P.) 28 times. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,446.46,608.30,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">7</ref> shows the acronym of each of the labels used in the confusion matrices. The colors in the matrix indicate the density of the entities and the system annotations.</p><p>The bottom right corner of each matrix is darker because of the large number of OTHER COMPOUND (O.C) entities in the dataset.  The majority of mislabeling occurred when more specific entity labels, such as STARTING MATERIAL (S.M.), REAGENT CATALYST (R.C.), or REAC-TION PRODUCT (R.P.), were predicted to be OTHER COMPOUND (O.C.). This may be because the models were able to predict that certain spans contained chemical named, but were too general and unable to predict the specific label. Additionally, spans annotated as OTHER COMPOUND (O.C.) were consistently predicted to be more specific types of compounds. It seems that while the models are able to predict which spans contain chemical compounds, they are less able to distinguish between the types of compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Task 2: Event Extraction</head><p>Results. Tables <ref type="table" coords="10,212.89,440.92,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_6">8</ref><ref type="table" coords="10,221.95,440.92,3.32,8.74" target="#tab_7">9</ref><ref type="table" coords="10,229.34,440.92,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_8">10</ref>show the exact match precision, recall, and F 1 scores obtained over the testing set for each of our three runs. Run 1 used our RelEx's CNN-based system trained over the ChemPatent embeddings with the trigger words identified using medaCy's biLSTM+CRF trained over the ChemPatent embeddings. Run 2 used our RelEx's rule-based system with the trigger words identified using medaCy's biLSTM+CRF trained with ChemPatent embeddings. Run 3 used our rule-based system with the trigger words identified using medaCy's biLSTM+CRF trained with WikiPubmed embeddings. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,402.07,524.61,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_9">11</ref> shows the comparison with the co-occurrence baseline provided by the organizers of the ChEMU challenge and the overall results from each of our runs.</p><p>The overall results show that all three runs obtain a higher precision and F 1 score than the baseline but not recall. The system results show that the CNN-based (Run 1) model obtains a higher overall F 1 score than both the rulebased (Run 2 &amp; 3) models. When training with CNN the overall precision of the predictions is high but the recall is low, this shows that CNN failed to classify all instances but was able to classify most of the predicted instances correct. Also, we can see the performance of each event class (Trigger word-Entity pair) in Run 1 is proportional to the number of instances in the training set. For example, event classes, REACTION STEP-REAGENT CATALYST predictions are false positives. Since the number of instances in the training set does not affect the rule-based methods, the performance of the event classes that have few instances performs better. For example, the event classes, WORKUP-TIME and REACTION STEP-OTHER COMPOUND, obtained zero F 1 score with CNN-based model but performed better with the rule-based models obtaining F 1 scores of 0.43 and 0.88, respectively. Table <ref type="table" coords="12,177.91,524.61,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_10">12</ref> shows the arithmetic mean and weighted arithmetic mean of the precision, recall, and F 1 score for both trigger word classes for each run. Bold terms indicate the best performance for each trigger word. We can see the CNNbased method (Run 1) performs well with the REACTION STEP classes and poor with WORKUP classes. This is because most of the REACTION STEP classes have more instances for the CNN to train on but most of the WORKUP classes have few instances. This is the same reason the rule-based methods (Run 2 &amp; 3) perform better with those classes. The weighted arithmetic mean results contradict with the arithmetic mean results, as we can see a notable difference in the F 1 score when comparing the classes of REACTION STEP and WORKUP. The WORKUP event class obtains a better performance due to the significant imbalance between the individual event classes. The weighted arithmetic mean allocates more weight to the classes that have more instances and vice versa we see an improvement in the performance of both classes.</p><p>Error Analysis. Tables <ref type="table" coords="13,247.70,280.52,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_11">13</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="13,280.44,280.52,9.96,8.74" target="#tab_12">14</ref> show a detailed error analysis of the CNNbased (Run 1) and the rule-based method (Run 2) respectively where the trigger words are trained with ChemPatent embeddings. Here we report the number of true positives (tp), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn) and also "fpm" and "fnm", two metrics that represent the number of false positives and false negatives, of which the corresponding entities are missing. The results are consistent with the previous observations from the tables 8, 9 and 10. We can see REACTION STEP classes performed better than the WORKUP classes. It is safe to say that, class imbalance plays a significant role in the miss-annotation of the instances. The results also show that the rulebased model significantly over annotates given the number of false positives. For example, the rule-based model (Run 2) identified 379 instances of the WORKUP-REACTION PRODUCT event class with only four being true positives. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We trained three biLSTM+CRF models over different pre-trained word embeddings, as well as differently sized datasets. Results show that while these models did not outperform the baseline model when evaluating exact span matches, the models outperformed the baseline when evaluating in relaxed mode. A model trained using word embeddings trained over chemical patents performed best when evaluating in relaxed mode, while a model trained using biomedical word embeddings and a combination of the training and development datasets performed best when evaluated on exact span matches. Errors primarily occurred because of issues with the model distinguishing between different entity labels, such as models mislabeling entities annotated as OTHER COMPOUND for more specific labels, like REACTION PRODUCT or STARTING MATERIAL. Additionally, the way that MedaCy predicts entity labels may have contributed to errors with labeling entity spans fully. Future work will focus on better distinguishing between different types of chemical compounds, as well as looking into models based on language models.</p><p>We used one CNN-based model and two rule-based models to extract events and according to the results, all three models outperformed the baseline model. Results show that the CNN-based method outperforms the rule-based methods, especially with the REACTION STEP classes as those classes have more instances to train on. Meanwhile, as the rule-based methods do not require training instances to train they perform better with WORKUP classes. In the future, we plan to explore building a hybrid model with both CNN and rule-based methods to increase the performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,180.82,190.72,299.77,8.74;4,134.77,202.68,345.82,8.74;4,134.77,214.64,345.83,8.74;4,134.77,226.59,345.82,8.74;4,134.77,238.55,345.82,8.74;4,134.77,250.50,227.24,8.74"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig 1 shows a simple example for the term mice.
