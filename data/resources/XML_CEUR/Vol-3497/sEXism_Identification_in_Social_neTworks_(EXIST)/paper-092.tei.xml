<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this challenge, we explore different large language models based solutions for all three tasks of EXIST 2023 (sEXism Identification in Social neTworks) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,346.78,380.18,11.36,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,360.86,380.18,7.57,10.91" target="#b2">2]</ref>, as part of CLEF 2023.</p><p>The challenge is divided into three tasks, namely Sexism Identification, Source Intention, and Sexism Categorisation, that collectively aim to classify, understand the intention, and categorise the facets of sexism in tweets to gain insights on the various forms of sexist expressions and behaviours on social media. For task 1, the objective is to perform a binary classification on tweets, segregating them into ones that manifest sexist expressions or behaviours and ones that do not. Task 2 aims to discern the underlying intent in tweets classified as sexist, categorising them into three classes: direct perpetration of sexism, reporting of experienced or observed sexism, and judgemental commentary on sexist situations or behaviours. The goal of the third task is to stratify the identified sexist tweets into five distinct categories reflective of the forms of sexism they exhibit: ideological and inequality, stereotyping and dominance, objectification, sexual violence, and misogyny and non-sexual violence. In this work, we attempted three tasks both in English and Spanish. Our approach utilises large language models with ensembling and cascading strategies for sexism identification on social media based on the text content.</p><p>In the provided dataset, there are two types of labels -hard and soft. For the hard labels, they are assigned by a majority vote of the annotations. Soft labels, on the other hand, are the entire set of human annotations with their variability, which is determined using the likelihood of each class. Note that, in tasks 1 and 2, which are mono label issues, the sum of the probabilities is equal to one. Whereas task 3 is a multi-label task, the probability sum there can be greater than one. We focus on the Hard labels for all three tasks -automated detection of multilingual sexism in social media posts. We design a system of cascades of language models for sexism detection. We also demonstrate an efficient way to utilise large language models, designed to speed up the inference time and maintain competitive performance. Our submission is ranked first among all 74 runs for tasks 1 and 2 on hard label evaluations and achieved a F 1 score of 0.8109 and a F 1 score for task 2 of 0.575. This shows that large language based cascade models are able to handle sexism identification and categorisation tasks confidently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Fundamentally, sexism identification is categorised as a subtask of abusive language detection. It shares a close relationship with a number of abusive language detection, including racism, hate speech, personal attacks, and others. We consider sexism identification a problem of text classification, where the models will classify which predefined labels a given text or tweet belongs to.</p><p>There have been studies done to identify sexism in the text on social media platforms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.70,551.42,11.23,10.91" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,489.63,551.42,7.42,10.91" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,499.76,551.42,7.42,10.91" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,564.97,7.43,10.91" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,99.45,564.97,7.50,10.91" target="#b7">7]</ref>. Most approaches use deep learning based methods to tackle this task. Jha and Mamidi <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.14,564.97,12.84,10.91" target="#b7">[7]</ref> included simple machine learning baselines (Support Vector Machines and FastText classifier) to classify tweets into three categories (hostile, benevolent and others). Sharifirad et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.14,592.07,12.84,10.91" target="#b5">[5]</ref> adopted text augmentation techniques and text generation data from ConceptNet and Wikidata to boost the model performance. Some related datasets have also been released to promote further research in this line <ref type="bibr" coords="2,213.91,632.72,11.36,10.91" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.99,632.72,7.47,10.91" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,238.19,632.72,12.32,10.91" target="#b10">10]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dataset</head><p>The given dataset contains both English and Spanish tweets for all three tasks. Since we only focus on the hard label identification task, the problem is formulated as a binary text classification task, a multi-class classification task, and a multi-label multi-class text classification task for tasks 1, 2 and 3.</p><p>For task 1, a total of 6,998 tweets are used for training. Among them, we randomly sampled 700 instances to use as a development dataset and the rest as a training dataset. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,470.36,533.10,5.05,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the overall statistics of the training data we used for task 1. Noted that we removed the "NOT_FOUND" instances when we trained all the models for task 1. For this task, both "Yes" and "No" labels are well balanced in distribution as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,388.67,573.75,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Task 2 was formulated as a four-class text classification problem with assigned hard labels. We follow the same approach by removing "NOT_FOUND" hard labelled instances from the training set, detailed data statistics can be referred to in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,365.07,614.40,3.72,10.91">2</ref>. For both English and Spanish data, it has an unbalanced distribution across the "Direct", "Judgement", and "Reported" labels. The "No" instances are shared across all jobs because they all use the same source data.</p><p>Task 3 focuses on the classification of sexism. We treated it as a multi-label multi-class text classification task, focusing on the hard labels. Five different categories are given ("Ideolog-ical and inequality", "Stereotyping and dominance", "Objectification", "Sexual violence" and "Misogyny and non-sexual violence"). The label distribution is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,444.09,100.52,3.74,10.91">3</ref>.</p></div>

We use a threshold on the confidence score to determine when to exit the cascade. The confidence threshold is one of the hyper-parameters in our settings. The final confidence threshold is picked depending on the best performance on our development set.</p><p>To highlight the practical benefit of cascades, it saves computation costs and improves inference speed compared to ensemble models. Based on our experiments, the cascade models yielded the best performance on the development dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Label Smoothing</head><p>One of the common problems with large language models is their overconfidence in prediction tasks. Label smoothing prevents the network from becoming overconfident and has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classification, language translation, and speech recognition. Label smoothing is a simple yet effective regularisation tool that operates on labels. The intuition behind label smoothing is to not let the model learn that a specific input results in only a specific output.</p><p>Instead of using one-hot encoded vectors ([0,1] in this case), we introduce noise distribution 𝑢(𝑦|𝑥). Our new ground truth label for data (𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ) would be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,191.96,586.50,310.83,48.93">𝑝 ′ (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) = (1 -𝜀)𝑝 (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝑢 (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) = {︃ 1 -𝜀 + 𝜀𝑢 (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) if 𝑦 = 𝑦 𝑖 𝜀𝑢 (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) otherwise (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,502.78,606.64,3.86,10.91">)</formula><p>where 𝜀 is a weight factor, 𝜀 ∈ [0, 1] and note that ∑︀ 𝐾 𝑦=1 𝑝 ′ (𝑦 | 𝑥 𝑖 ) = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 4</head><p>Approach tested in each run.  By applying this technique, the model becomes less confident with extremely confident labels. This is exactly what we wanted to avoid. As our cascade models are selected purely based on the confidence score, this leads to better estimates on easy and hard sample selections.</p></div>
