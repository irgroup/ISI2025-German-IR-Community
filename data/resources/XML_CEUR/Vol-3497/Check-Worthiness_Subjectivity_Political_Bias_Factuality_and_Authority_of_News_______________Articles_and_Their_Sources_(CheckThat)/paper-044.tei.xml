<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper introduces the methodology of Team Accenture for the CLEF CheckThat! shared task on identifying political biases in news articles and news sources. We utilize machine back-translation to augment the minority classes in datasets labeling article and news source bias in three categories-Left, Center, and Right, and used this augmented data to fine-tune RoBERTa transformer models. This was the highest ranking strategy in the shared task for detecting both political bias of a news article (at 0.473 Mean Average Precision) as well as for detecting political bias of a news source (at 0.549 mean average precision).</p></div>

Task 3B provides bias-labeled news-sites and a collection of articles scraped from each news site. Given the news source and the articles, the goal is to classify URLs of news outlets as 'Left', 'Center', or 'Right'. Teams are evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,114.06,17.96,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> where lower MAE is better.

We see that while the training set for news article bias consists of a much larger training sample than the news media source bias, it has significantly less number of unique words. We would hypothesize that a larger quantity of unique words would yield models of higher performance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Label Balance</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,178.13,496.27,3.73,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, all of the datasets provided by the CheckThat! organizers had label bias which skewed each dataset towards articles that were labeled class 2 (Right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">WordPiece Analysis</head><p>Transformer models utilize WordPiece tokenization schemes that are dependant on the model being evaluated. At the time of pre-training, the WordPiece algorithm determines which pieces of words will be retained, and which will be discarded.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Transformer Architectures and Pre-Trained Models</head><p>In this work, we utilize RoBERTa models. The Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer (BERT) is a transformer-based architecture that was introduced in 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.06,458.57,16.55,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,439.91,458.57,12.42,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref>. BERT has had a substantial impact on the field of NLP, and achieved state of the art results on 11 NLP benchmarks at the time of its release. RoBERTa, introduced by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.83,485.67,16.28,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, modified various parts of BERTs training process. These modifications include more training data, more pre-training steps with bigger batches over more data, removing BERT's Next Sentence Prediction, training on longer sequences, and dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data <ref type="bibr" coords="3,110.75,539.87,16.17,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. For this work, we fine-tune roberta-large <ref type="bibr" coords="3,315.79,539.87,16.17,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The English RoBERTa model contains 50,265 WordPieces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data Augmentation</head><p>The organizers provided a training and a development set for each language. We use the provided training set and development set to create internal training and validation sets for experimentation. We use the test set provided by organizers as a hold-out test set. For each article, training data was augmented using back-translation provided by AWS Translate. We appended back-translated left-and center-labeled articles to the training set. In our 2021 experiment <ref type="bibr" coords="4,186.08,382.09,16.42,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we found that this form of augmentation resulted in a significant increase in recall and F1 score for check-worthy tweets. For both article and news source classification, we used Spanish as the pivot language. Due to significant sample imbalance in the training sets for both tasks, we augmented the 0 (Left)-and 1 (Center)-class until the samples are balanced. Specifically, for classification of article bias, we augmented 5,000 samples of the 0-class and 2,000 of the 1 (Center)-class. For classification of news source bias, we augmented 700 samples of the 0 (Left)-class and 300 of the 1 (Left)-class. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,385.07,463.38,5.01,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the BLEU score for each back-translation scheme. The lower the score, the more divergent the translation to the original text. In a machine translation workflow we would wish to maximize the BLEU score for the best translation. In a data augmentation workflow, we wish to introduce variation to the training data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Classification</head><p>For the Article Bias Classification RoBERTa model, we added an additional mean-pooling layer and dropout layer on top of the model prior to the final three binary classification layers, each of which corresponding to a class (i.e., 0 (Left), 1 (Center), or 2 (Right)). The highest class probability determines the article's final classification. This approach is sometimes referred to as the one-against-all approach for multi-class problem <ref type="bibr" coords="4,332.54,621.51,16.09,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Adding these additional layers has been shown to help prevent over-fitting while fine-tuning. We used an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2𝑒 -5 and an epsilon of 1.5𝑒 -8. We use a binary cross-entropy loss function, 4 epochs, and a batch size of 32. For the News Source Bias Classification, the same model architecture above is used to finetune a RoBERTa model and classify all article from each news source. We used the majority class label of all articles of a given news source as the class label to establish source bias.</p><p>For comparison, we have fine-tuned an additional RoBERTa model for each task above with a single multi-class classifier instead of three binary classifiers. We kept all parameters above the same with a few exceptions: we used the Softmax activation and the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,114.70,111.28,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_3">5</ref> contains model performance on the test set provided by the organizers. Our One-Against-All News Article Bias had an accuracy of 0.633 and a weighted average F1-score of 0.632. Our One-Against-All News Media Source Bias classifier had an accuracy of 0.627 and a weighted average F1-score of 0.625. The official evaluation numbers are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,449.29,151.93,3.81,10.91">6</ref>, where the One-Against-All News Article Bias received an MAE of 0.473 and the One-Against-All News Media Source Bias classifier received an MAE of 0.549.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This paper demonstrates models for the classification of political bias in news articles and news sources. In both models, we utilize a pre-trained RoBERTa Large model fine-tuned to the task. We utilized back translation as a strategy to augment the training data, addressing label bias which is found in many machine learning problems. Of the four teams that participated in this shared task, Team Accenture achieved the best overall MAE for 3A (0.473). Of the two teams that submitted, Team Accenture achieved the best overall MAE for 3B (0.549). In addition, for classification of Bias News Article, the one-against-all and the multi-class classifier did not differ significantly in performance. However, for classification of Bias News Sources, the multi-class classifier outperform the one-against-all approach in accuracy but under-perform in MAE. Overall, Team Accenture's choice of implementing three binary classification layers instead of a single multi-class classifier is the optimal one in both performance and fine-tuning time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,255.94,196.17,8.93;3,145.43,84.19,304.41,159.19"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Label distribution across training sets</figDesc><graphic coords="3,145.43,84.19,304.41,159.19" type="bitmap" /></figure>
