<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Biased news content often mixes factual reporting and misinformation, but even parts that are factual can at times be highly subjective. If this subjectivity stays unnoticed by the editors and finally readers, this bias can inadvertently influence the reader's opinion. Consequentially, automatically identifying subjective texts can be desirable objective, especially for fact-checkers and editors. In this paper, we present our efforts in addressing the subjectivity detection task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,493.30,453.70,12.68,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> within the context of CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,257.10,467.25,11.26,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,271.09,467.25,7.51,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The goal of the task is to classify sentences from a news article as subjective if it expresses the author's personal view or as objective if it exhibits an objective view of the news topic.</p><p>One of the challenges encountered in the subjectivity classification task is the issue of class imbalance, where the number of objective samples is significantly more than the number of subjective samples in the training data. Class imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly in accurately identifying subjective sentences. Another challenge is the broad definition of subjectivity which differs across cultures and tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,327.53,562.10,11.30,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,341.56,562.10,7.53,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>, subjectivity in journalistic tasks is different than the subjectivity in other tasks, hence data generation with normal paraphrasing might not fit the journalistic context of this task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel data generation with the GPT-3 models <ref type="bibr" coords="1,297.55,602.74,12.99,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that leverages prompt with different styles derived from a subjectivity checklist based on a journalistic perspective.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments in three languages from the task datasets: English, Turkish and German. We demonstrate that employing different subjective styles within each language can enhance the performance of subjectivity detection models. This highlights the importance of considering diverse subjective styles specific to each language. Our second finding is that style-based oversampling outperforms normal paraphrasing in Turkish and English datasets; this shows that normal paraphrasing might miss the journalistic perspective on the samples. Lastly, by comparing two GPT-3 models which are the state-ofart generative large language models: text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT), we observe that the generation of plausible style-based texts by GPT-3 models can be challenging in non-English languages. This emphasizes the need for further research and improvement in generating linguistically coherent subjective texts in languages other than English.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are as follows:</p><p>• To create prompts with distinct journalistic styles for assessing subjectivity in English, Turkish and German, we construct a subjectivity checklist from the journalism and linguistic studies. • Thanks to style-based prompts, we generate texts in the three languages using the GPT-3 models. Our extensive experiments reveal sampling effectiveness from the generated samples in training more accurate subjectivity classifiers. In addition, we show the limitations of the GPT-3 models on the robustness of the generating samples in languages other than English. The generated samples and the code for our experiments are publicly available.<ref type="foot" coords="2,158.20,366.52,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Tackling Imbalanced Datasets</head><p>Even though transformers perform well across many NLP tasks, learning from imbalanced datasets remains still unsolved in NLP. To address this issue, sampling, data augmentation via back-translation and/or paraphrasing are popular methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.59,474.96,11.41,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Since determining subjectivity depends on many indicators such as cultural background and the specific task at hand <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.74,488.51,11.58,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, these methods might not be effective in subjectivity detection in journalism. With the aim of generating samples that reflect the journalistic perspectives for identifying subjective texts, we apply a style-based text generation by using the state-of-art instructional GPT-3 models. We leverage a journalistic checklist to identify the styles of subjective texts. Although style-based text generation has been widely used in conversational tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.92,556.26,11.48,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, fake news detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,473.88,556.26,16.30,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been used in computational journalism tasks for providing a journalistic perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">GPT-3 Models</head><p>GPT-3 based language models demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating novel text passages by utilizing concise user instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,300.86,646.63,16.54,10.91" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,320.14,646.63,7.65,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>. These instructions guide the model in generating output that aligns with the specified requirements, which includes the ability to rewrite input text into diverse linguistic styles. This feature makes these models well-suited for the data augmentation task that is the goal of the current study. For this purpose, the GPT-3 models text-davinci-003 was selected for all data samples generated for the submission version of the model. After the submission, we additionally performed a comparative test to find out how the model gpt-3.5-turbo (better known as ChatGPT) compares to the original choice. While gpt-3.5-turbo was released after text-davinci-003 and is better tuned to give concise answers in a chat-like manner, it is impossible to declare one generally more performative than the other. The two models have a similar overall performance, but their robustness varies depending on the given task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.15,402.10,16.41,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This makes it important to evaluate the differences in the generated outputs and evaluate the respective strengths for this particular use case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task Definition and Dataset</head><p>The goal of the task is to identify subjective sentences from news articles that express the author's viewpoint on a given news topic <ref type="bibr" coords="3,274.58,501.37,11.35,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is a classification task, and the performance of the models is evaluated based on the F1 score. The task datasets consist of articles written in multiple languages. For our experiments and deep investigation of our methodology, we select only datasets in English, Turkish and German since they are either authors' native language or profession language. The statistics of the datasets we use are provided in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,461.37,555.57,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Subjectivity Checklist</head><p>Given the broad nature of subjectivity and the potential biases inherent in the GPT-3 models, it is crucial to approach the generation of texts reflecting a journalistic perspective with caution. Standard paraphrasing techniques may not adequately capture the journalistic perspective. Therefore, we design a checklist of styles, each representing a specific aspect of subjectivity used by editorials. To construct the checklist, we interviewed some editors from the Deutsche Welle on how they define subjectivity in a news article and then investigate the journalism and the linguistic literature to align with the interview. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,347.41,581.34,5.12,10.91">2</ref> shows the final checklist with the references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Prompt Design</head><p>To generate texts using the GPT-3 models and enable fair comparisons across different languages and styles, we devised prompt/instruction templates that possess common meaning across languages and can be easily adapted to various styles. Initially, we created an English template for generating texts in all languages. However, we observed that the template yielded highly implausible samples when applied to languages other than English. As a result, we created templates that are written in each language.</p><p>To create language-specific templates, the first two authors of this paper, one being a native Turkish speaker and the other a native German speaker, both proficient in English, engaged in discussions regarding the English prompt. Once a final English prompt was agreed upon, they translated the prompt and the associated styles into their native languages. In order to assure coherence between the languages, the prompts are kept short or simple. This has the downside that the instructions are not very specific and are for instance not mentioning the news context of the text samples. While this study aims to give a first insight into the potential of the approach in a multi-lingual context in general, designing more complex prompts should be a goal of future research. The prompts and styles in different languages are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,115.79,614.72,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="5,142.74,614.72,30.56,10.91" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Data Generation and Sampling Strategies</head><p>To generate the dataset, we compute the difference between the number of subjective and the number of objective samples for each language in the training dataset. We then randomly<ref type="foot" coords="6,501.78,119.33,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> select samples from the objective samples based on the calculated difference for each style in the checklist. This selection used for the style-based generation. We then select samples from the subjective class distribution for the normal style, which are defined as subjective samples that are not exaggerated in any particular other style category. This serves as the baseline to compare the other styles in the checklist to. Finally, new texts are generated from the samples by using the OpenAI GPT-3 models.</p><p>We employ both under-sampling and over-sampling <ref type="foot" coords="6,330.60,214.17,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> techniques to address class imbalances within the datasets. When under-sampling, we take half of the difference between the subjective and objective samples as the number of samples to be removed. For the normal style, the objective texts are merely dropped, while the objective samples are replaced with style-generated samples for all other styles. When over-sampling, we merge the generated samples with the original task datasets to balance the class distribution. Here, the normal samples are merged with generated sentences based on the subjective samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Transformer Training</head><p>To encode texts and train subjectivity classifiers, we utilize language-specific transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="6,486.97,346.95,16.24,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>: Roberta-base <ref type="bibr" coords="6,150.12,360.50,17.94,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for English, German Bert <ref type="bibr" coords="6,285.41,360.50,17.94,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for German and BERTurk <ref type="bibr" coords="6,422.94,360.50,17.94,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> for Turkish as these models have demonstrated strong performance on the tasks in their respective languages. Since the sentences are short, we limit the input size to a maximum of 128 tokens. We train the models for 3 epochs and with the batches size of 8. For evaluation, we choose the models that attain the highest F1 score at the development sets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Evaluation of the Styles on the Classifiers</head><p>We examine the impact of new samples that generated with text-davinci-003 on the performance of fine-tuned transformers. We compare the models trained with the augmented samples against three baselines. The first baseline consists of models trained solely on the original datasets, denoted as no style. The second baseline involves normal augmentation, which entails paraphrasing subjective texts. The third baseline is the paraphrasing of the objective texts with the subjective style. Additionally, we measure the performance of the models trained on datasets containing all styles. The results, as presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,335.62,575.59,3.74,10.91">6</ref>, show that style-based oversampling are beneficial in enhancing the robustness of the English and Turkish transformers, while it does not have the effect on the German transformers.

The bold scores indicate the best scores in terms of F1 and F1 of the subjective class (F1-Sub), US: under-sampling, OS: over-sampling. Over-sampling enhances the performance of the English and Turkish models. The style of augmented training datasets of the best models are different in each language. exaggerated and prejudiced styles are particularly useful for the Turkish transformers, whereas propaganda and exaggerated styles are impactful for the English transformers. Furthermore, augmenting the dataset with a combination of all styles improves the performance of the Turkish model. The effectiveness of different styles across languages may be attributed to factors such as dataset bias or variations in subjectivity across different cultures.</p><p>For our participation in the CheckThat Lab!, we submitted the models trained on undersampled datasets as our official entries. The style of the submitted entries are the most useful styles on evaluation with the development set (exaggeration for Turkish, propaganda for German and partisan for English). Our submissions outperformed the task baseline-a multilingual sentence transformer-and achieved a 1st place ranking for English and a 3rd place ranking for Turkish <ref type="bibr" coords="7,127.03,639.22,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As previously mentioned however, it is worth noting that further tests after the submission showed that over-sampling is the better technique compared to under-sampling for enhancing models using style-based text generation, as seen in the increase in performance.</p></div>

The results are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,454.03,464.46,3.74,10.91">8</ref>.</p><p>Overall, the English sentence generation yielded the most plausible sentences across all categories. The Q1 score for Model 2 was the highest of all models, which however did not always lead to a higher Q2 score, as the models at times exaggerated the given styles via the use of colloquialisms, outdated language and insulting phrases. These findings are similar for the German samples, with the difference that the linguistic variance was more subtle and led to less exaggerated results. There also is less of a linguistic difference between the outputs of the two tested models, as indicated by a more similar Q1 score.</p><p>In the case of Turkish samples, Model 2 appeared to produce texts that were more grammatically and semantically correct compared to the other model. The Q1 score was also generally higher for Model 2. However, it should be noted that the generated texts were not perfect for each style and model. Interestingly, we observed that first-person texts were common in both generated samples with the subjectivity style, which makes texts unnatural. Consequently, the Q2 scores for both models were low.</p><p>A general observation is, that the models at times repeatedly use the same style alteration as a response to the prompts. In case of the subjective style, there was a pattern of adding pronouns</p></div>

The English sentences are at times greatly exaggerated, for instance by using crude language. Some samples even have a strong racist connotation. Both models unnecessarily add first person nouns to the generated samples in Turkish. The German samples at times use adjectives and phrases that are unfitting to the topic of the sentence.</p></div>

(Turkish samples) or statements such as "I believe" (English and German samples) to the text without making many other semantic changes. English propaganda samples heavily rely on references to the nation and calls to "join the fight", while Turkish prejudiced samples often featured the inclusion of English words. While these simple tricks increase the Q1 scores, they do not necessarily represent the linguistic diversity that is used in real language, which limits the potential of the generated samples for data augmentation. Better prompting and parameter tuning aimed at a higher subtlety and more linguistic diversity in the generated outputs could therefore lead to improved results. It should be noted that Model 1 generated racist statements using problematic language when asked to generate samples in prejudice language. This is an important limitation, as this type of bias can become a problem for most downstream tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, our study utilized style-based sampling with the GPT-3 models, incorporating styles derived from a journalistic checklist to address data scarcity in subjectivity task. Our experiments demonstrated that style-based data augmentation is more advantageous than normal paraphrasing. Moreover, we observed that the most beneficial style for augmentation varies across languages, the cultural differences and data bias might play a role too.</p><p>Our approach is language specific and limited by the lack of available data for low-resource languages. This is also visible in the lower quality output of the GPT-3 models in languages other than English, especially for Turkish samples. Future studies should hence focus on expanding the search for language models that are better suited or can be tuned to generate more plausible results for our target languages. The phrasing of the instructional prompts is another way that could significantly improve the results, for instance giving more detailed descriptions of the use case and explanations of the style requirements. Additionally, we recognize the importance of sample selection in achieving successful style transfer. Therefore, we plan to investigate data selection methods, with a particular emphasis on challenging samples, in order to improve the quality of generated data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,263.10,261.68,8.93"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The methodology we applied on the subjectivity task.</figDesc></figure>
