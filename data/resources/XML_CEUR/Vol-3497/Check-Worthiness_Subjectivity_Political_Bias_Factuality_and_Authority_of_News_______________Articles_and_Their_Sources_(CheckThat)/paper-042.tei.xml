<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, we report our participation in CheckThat! lab's Task 1. The aim is to determine whether a claim made in either unimodal or multimodal content is worth fact-checking. We implemented standard preprocessing and fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa-large model. Additionally, we applied zero-shot learning and utilized a feed-forward network with embeddings for unimodal content. For subtask 1A submission, we used combined BERT-based models (BERT and BERT multilingual), ResNet50, and Feed Forward network and we ranked as 3 rd (Arabic) and 5 th (English). We used feed forward network with embeddings for subtask 1B submission and ranked as 3 rd in Arabic and 6 th in both English and Spanish. In further experiments, our evaluation shows that XLM-RoBERTa-large model outperforms the other models.</p></div>

The transcriptions were done by students, professors, and journalists. Hassan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.45,511.42,17.91,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> described how the fact-checking platform ClaimBuster combines supervised learning to identify significant factual assertions in political debates. In their study, Thorne and Vlachos <ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.91,538.52,17.91,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> reviewed automated fact-checking research and related areas, including task formulations and approaches from various papers and authors. They indicated that supervised learning methods are used for automated factchecking and discussed the emerging field of fact-checking involving images and footage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>We utilized the dataset provided by the organizers of the CLEF CheckThat! 2023 lab for Task 1: Check-Worthiness in Multimodal and Unimodal Contents <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.57,586.59,16.53,10.91" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.82,586.59,12.58,10.91" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,387.12,586.59,12.40,10.91" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Subtask 1A comprises both text and images as input data, collected from Twitter. Subtask 1B includes only text data, which is a mix of political debates, transcriptions, and tweets on topics such as COVID-19 and politics. We present the distribution of the official datasets used in this shared task for our experiments in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,185.32,640.78,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> (for Subtask 1A) and Table <ref type="table" coords="3,313.97,640.78,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> (for Subtask 1B). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Preprocessing</head><p>The datasets for CheckThat! lab Task 1 were collected from multiple sources including Twitter. These datasets contain numerous symbols, URLs, and invisible characters. To cleanse this noisy data, we underwent several preprocessing steps. We began by removing extraneous characters and URLs, followed by the elimination of stopwords, hashtags, and usernames from the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Model</head><p>We used only deep learning models to run both multimodal and multigenre classification experiments. For multimodal classification, we used transformer-based BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,441.37,638.79,18.05,10.91" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and XLM-RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="4,135.26,652.34,18.07,10.91" target="#b46">[47]</ref> models for text input, ResNet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,295.41,652.34,18.07,10.91" target="#b47">[48]</ref> for image input, and a Feed Forward (FF) network for the fusion of both representations. The parameter sizes of BERT and XLM-RoBERTa are the largest of the transformer-based models. <ref type="foot" coords="5,310.44,545.11,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref> The size of the network and the number of parameters determine computation time and learning performance. For these two models, we used the base and multilingual versions of the BERT model and the large version of the XLM-RoBERTa<ref type="foot" coords="5,155.13,585.75,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_7">8</ref> model. Although ResNet50 has only more than 23 million trainable parameters, it provides comparatively better performances. Our rationale for choosing different models was to understand and report their performance in different languages. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Subtask-1A</head><p>For Subtask-1A, we utilized a transformer-based pretrained model for text input and a CNNbased pretrained model for image input. The output from each model was concatenated and passed through a simple feed-forward network. We deployed two different architectures to train and evaluate each language. For the first experimental setup, focusing on the Arabic language, we chose the multilingual version of BERT for text input and ResNet50 for image input.</p><p>For the first experimental setup focused on the English language, we chose the BERT base version for text input and ResNet50 for image input. For the second experimental setups in both languages, we selected XLM-RoBERTa-large for text input and ResNet50 for image input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Subtask-1B</head><p>Transformer Models We used the Transformer Toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="7,352.33,107.54,17.93,10.91" target="#b48">[49]</ref> for transformer-based models. For Subtask-1B, we fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model <ref type="bibr" coords="7,343.68,121.08,17.91,10.91" target="#b46">[47]</ref> with a learning rate of 1𝑒 -5, a maximum sequence length of 128, and a batch size of 16. We utilized a model-specific tokenizer available with the toolkit for our study. During training on the train split only, we set the epochs to 4, 14, and 5 for Arabic, English, and Spanish, respectively. However, when we merged the train and development sets for training, we ran 3, 14, and 4 epochs for Arabic, English, and Spanish, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zero-shot Learning</head><p>We used GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,265.00,217.44,17.81,10.91" target="#b49">[50]</ref> for zero-shot learning which is also a transformerbased model. We simply used the test set for evaluating the GPT-4 model without using any kind of training data. As for the prompt, we used the similar format discussed in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,453.02,244.54,16.32,10.91" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, as also shown in Listing 1. Our prompt was relatively simple, which can be explored further in future studies.</p><p>Listing 1: Example of zero-shot prompt.</p><p>Classify the following text into one of the two categories: Yes or No.\n\n text: {inputText}\n label:\n Feed Forward Network with Embedding First, we extract the embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for each data split. We then fine-tune a feed-forward network on the embeddings extracted from the training set to train our model. Our feed-forward model utilizes the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. We have set the learning rate to 0.001 and the hidden layer size to 500. We validate our model using the validation set and finally, we evaluate the model using the test set.</p></div>

Overall, the performance of the multimodal systems is relatively lower than that of unimodal multigenre systems, and the performance for Arabic is comparatively lower.</p><p>The detailed classification results for two subtasks and each language are reported in Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,89.04,601.84,5.16,10.91" target="#tab_4">4</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="7,116.37,601.84,3.80,10.91" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. We re-ran all the experiments and reported the detailed results once the submission period had ended and the gold set had been made available. From the reported results, we can conclude that XLM-RoBERTa-large pretrained language model performs better for subtask-1B. Although the XLM-RoBERTa-large language model provides a better F1-score with respect to the positive class for subtask-1A, it did not perform satisfactorily by a large margin for the negative class.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>As part of the shared task, the organizers of CLEF CheckThat! Lab 2023 provided multimodal (images and texts) and multigenre datasets. We began by cleaning the data using standard preprocessing steps, followed by conducting comparative experiments. Our investigation of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, etc.) found that the XLM-RoBERTa large version model outperforms other language models. In the submissions for subtask 1A, we ranked 3 rd (Arabic) and 5 th (English). For subtask 1B submissions, we ranked 3 rd in Arabic and 6 th in both English and Spanish. Our future study includes exploring GPT-based large language models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="4,88.99,90.49,350.27,20.87"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Data splits and distributions of Subtask 1A: Check-Worthiness of multimodal content</figDesc><table /></figure>
