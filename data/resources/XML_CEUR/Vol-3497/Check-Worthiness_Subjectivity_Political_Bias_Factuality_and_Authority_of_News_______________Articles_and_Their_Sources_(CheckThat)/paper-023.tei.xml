<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present an overview of Task 5 of the sixth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, which is a part of the 2023 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). In this Authority Finding task, participating systems are required to retrieve a set of authority Twitter accounts for a given rumor expressed in a propagating Arabic tweet. Two teams participated in this first version of the task, submitting a total of four runs, 3 of which managed to achieve significant improvement over the baseline. In this paper, we present our data collection approach, evaluation setup, and an overview of the participating systems. We release to the research community the dataset as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research on this new task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The explosive growth of social media platforms over the recent years has facilitated the spread of misinformation and fake news. To address this issue, a myriad of initiatives addressed verification of claims propagating on social media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,295.29,406.68,11.48,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,309.61,406.68,7.52,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,319.97,406.68,7.65,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>, or over the Web <ref type="bibr" coords="1,410.16,406.68,11.48,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,424.48,406.68,7.65,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Additionally, a plethora of fact-checking organizations were launched worldwide covering multiple regions and languages to perform manual claim verification. However, given the large scale of misinformation circulating in different communication platforms, there is still an urgent need to debunk it despite all the efforts made.</p><p>To extend existing efforts and foster system development to debunk misinformation, Check-That! Lab was launched in 2018 featuring a variety of tasks to help automate the fact-checking process. The CheckThat! lab runs for the sixth time under the umbrella of CLEF 2023. 1 The objective of this edition of the lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,242.43,515.07,12.89,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> was to encourage work on detecting multimodal checkworthy claims, detecting subjectivity in news articles, predicting the political bias of news articles and news media, predicting the factuality of reporting of news media, and finding authorities that can help verify rumors in Twitter.</p><p>In this paper, we describe in detail Task 5 of this year's lab, 2 Authority Finding in Twitter. Task 5 is defined as follows: "Given a tweet stating a rumor, a model has to retrieve a ranked list of authority Twitter accounts that can help in verifying the rumor; i.e. they may tweet evidence that supports or denies that rumor <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.55,101.53,11.24,9.72" target="#b7">[8]</ref>". An illustration of the task with an example from our data<ref type="foot" coords="2,108.23,112.31,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> is presented in Figure . 1.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We give an overview of the related work in Section 2. Section 3 introduces our task dataset. Section 4 discusses the reported evaluation measures. We then present an overview of the participants' systems in Section 5, and discuss the evaluation results in Section 6. A failure analysis discussion is presented in Section 7. Finally, we conclude in Section 8. </p></div>

The first category covers studies targeting topic expert finding, where given a topic the task is to retrieve a ranked list of expert accounts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,396.42,175.28,16.56,10.91" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.92,175.28,12.42,10.91" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Second, studies focusing on local expert finding, which is similar to topic expert finding, but the difference is that the experts should be within a specific location <ref type="bibr" coords="3,324.93,202.38,16.51,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,344.17,202.38,12.39,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>.

Additionally, several methods were proposed to address the task adopting either the Bayes theorem for estimating the probability that a user is an expert <ref type="bibr" coords="3,414.67,283.68,16.46,10.91" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,433.87,283.68,12.35,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref>, proposing a query-dependent personalized PageRank <ref type="bibr" coords="3,268.90,297.22,16.09,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, or utilizing a learning-to-rank framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,472.93,297.22,16.30,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,491.36,297.22,12.23,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Differently, Haouari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.73,310.77,17.91,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> introduced the task of authority finding for rumor verification in Twitter where not all experts are authorities. The authors considered the task as a subproblem of topic expert finding in social media. They released the first authority finder test collection targeting the Arabic language, and proposed a hybrid model that incorporates the lexical and semantic textual representation of users, and users networks features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Authority Finding Dataset</head><p>Training Data We adopted AuFIN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,252.37,423.60,17.75,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> test collection which comprises 150 rumors expressed in tweets, associated with 1,044 authority Twitter accounts, and a user collection of 395,231 Twitter accounts along with their Twitter lists <ref type="bibr" coords="3,293.89,450.69,12.83,10.91" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.72,450.69,12.83,10.91">192</ref>,284 unique lists). Each authority is graded whether she is highly relevant or relevant to the rumor, i.e., having a higher priority to be contacted for verification or not. The rumors cover three categories: politics, sports, and health (50 from each category). We split the rumors into 120 for training and 30 for development.</p><p>Testing Data We collected 30 new rumors from AraFacts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,366.45,520.10,16.42,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, where we focused on the ones collected from Misbar and Fatabayyano which were exploited recently to construct Arabic rumor verification <ref type="bibr" coords="3,171.80,547.20,17.76,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and fake news detection <ref type="bibr" coords="3,300.36,547.20,17.76,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> datasets. We selected 10 rumors from each one of the three above categories. For each rumor, two annotators were asked separately to identify all possible authority Twitter accounts who can help in supporting or debunking that rumor following the annotation guidelines and data quality evaluation provided by Haouari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,113.52,601.40,16.27,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation Measures</head><p>We report P@1 and P@5 to evaluate how well the participating systems retrieve Twitter authorities at the top of a short retrieved ranked list. We further report NDCG@5 to measure the ability of systems to retrieve highly relevant authority Twitter accounts higher up in that list. We adopt P@5 as the official evaluation measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Overview of the Participating Systems</head><p>A total of two teams participated in this task, submitting four runs. We present below an overview of each team approach.</p><p>bigIR bigIR team adopted the hybrid model proposed by Haouari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,410.39,581.62,17.91,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that incorporates lexical, semantic, and user network features to retrieve authorities. To get the initial candidates, they first utilized the bio_lists_index 4 to get the lexical scores of the top 1000 users, and then used the network features, i.e., count of Twitter lists, followers, and followees, to compute the initial scores. To get the semantic scores for the top 100 initial candidates, they used Arabic BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,116.45,649.37,17.76,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> fine-tuned with the full training data and deployed in Tahaqqaq real-time system <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.56,649.37,16.08,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Finally, the initial and the semantic scores were interpolated to get the hybrid final scores for the candidates to rerank them. The team submitted three runs varying the interpolation weight 𝛼 to 0.5, 0.75, and 0.25 for Hybrid1, Hybrid2, and Hybrid3 runs respectively. In other words, they assigned equal weights to both scores, more weight to the initial scores, and more weight to the semantic scores for the runs respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ES-VRAI [32]</head><p>Similar to bigIR, they leveraged the lexical matching and user features to retrieve authorities, however they neglected the semantic matching between the rumor and the users. The team utilized the bio_lists_index <ref type="bibr" coords="5,307.34,183.47,18.07,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and optimised BM25 hyper-parameters to retrieve the initial candidates. They then re-scored and reranked the initially retrieved candidates by exploiting the users' metadata features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Evaluation Results</head><p>Table . 3 shows the official results for Task 5. We can clearly notice that only three runs, which are submitted by bigIR team, managed to outperform the BM25 baseline. We observe that bigIR (Hybrid3) run is the top performing in terms of all evaluation measures. Contrary to the findings presented by Haouari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,210.53,309.84,16.22,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which states "the initial retrieval score is more indicative than the semantic score, " bigIR (Hybrid3) assigns higher weight (0.75 vs. 0.25) to the semantic scores than to the initial retrieval scores. Moreover, bigIR (Hybrid2), which assigns higher weight (0.75) to the initial scores is the least performing compared to other bigIR runs. These results highlight that there is no best setup for setting the interpolation weight, and that the data plays a significant factor, i.e., 𝛼 could vary for different data to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we can conclude that the ArabicBERT model fine-tuned on the training data is able to generalize to new emerging data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Failure Analysis</head><p>We conducted a thorough failure analysis on all rumors on which the best model, bigIR (Hybrid3), could not retrieve any authority at depth 100. This comprises 5 rumors of our test set (16.7%).</p><p>We study both the false negatives, and false positives error types. This section presents the main potential reasons of these failures in detail. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">False Negatives</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,115.80,532.06,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_0">4</ref> presents examples of rumors along with authorities failed to be retrieved at depth 100. We discuss below the potential reasons behind these failures.</p><p>1. No lexical overlap: Some rumors do not have any lexical overlap with the user textual representation, e.g., 𝑇 1 and 𝑇 2 . Thus, the model fails to retrieve these users, as the model initial candidates are retrieved by lexical matching.</p><p>2. Lack of context: Some rumors may require context expansion to retrieve relevant authorities, e.g., 𝑇 1 , which is about the appointment of a new coach to train the Algerian football team, where it is not clear that Djamel Belmadi is a football coach. Similarly, for 𝑇 2 , some additional context is required to understand that the vaccine is for COVID-19.</p><p>3. Misspelled entities: Some rumors have misspelled entities, which may affect the retrieval of relevant authorities, e.g., in 𝑇 1 , Algeria is misspelled (the only one in Arabic in this tweet, indicated in red).</p><p>4. Non-Arabic keywords: Some tweets may mention entities in non-Arabic, e.g., in 𝑇 1 .</p><p>The model used by bigIR preprocesses the rumors by excluding non-Arabic keywords, while these can be key terms in the rumor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">False Positives</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="7,128.88,459.13,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_1">5</ref>, we present examples of rumors along with their top retrieved non-authority. We found that the main reason behind this type of failure is lack of context, which leads to retrieving false positive users just because of some lexical overlap on some of the rumor keywords. For example, 𝑇 3 and 𝑇 4 , as discussed in Section 7.1, need additional context. This led the model to retrieve irrelevant users who have lexical overlap on some of the rumor keywords.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a detailed overview of the CLEF 2023 CheckThat! Lab Task 5 for authority finding in Twitter. Some of the participant systems leveraged the lexical matching along with user network features only, while others expanded this by incorporating the semantic matching between the rumor and the user textual representations, which showed a significant improvement over lexical matching. Moreover, all systems adopted the user profile and their Twitter lists to represent users, which is the SOTA user representation for this task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,373.52,373.02,8.96;2,103.08,247.79,124.74,59.40"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An illustration of the Authority Finding in Twitter task with a real-world example.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,103.08,247.79,124.74,59.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
