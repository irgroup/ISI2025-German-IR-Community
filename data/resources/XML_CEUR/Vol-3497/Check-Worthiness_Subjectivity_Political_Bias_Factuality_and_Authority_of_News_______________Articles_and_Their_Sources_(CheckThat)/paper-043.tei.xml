<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>News sources are expected to present factual evidence with accurate and unbiased reasoning to inform their readership. A news source that repeatedly presents reporting with low factuality can erode confidence and trust and lose a reader. With a low barrier to technical entry, numerous news sources have emerged, and it can be difficult to evaluate a new source for accuracy, especially if one is not familiar with their reputation. Tools such as social media and news aggregators can utilize social signals, but the social network propagating the news may not be motivated or qualified to evaluate the source for factuality. Propagation of false and misleading information through these networks can harm decision making of a group and cause spread of misinformation. This paper presents a model that learns the factuality levels of news articles and news sources, using an NLP data augmentation strategy to increase the size of the training data. The model can then be applied to unseen news sources and articles to identify the factuality level of the document. A system, like this one, could be utilized in a news aggregator or social network to flag an article with a credibility warning or to deactivate user interface elements that promote article dissemination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As news information ecosystems become increasingly fractured and divisive, and with the increase of citizen journalism causing an increase in news sources, users must constantly evaluate the veracity of the sources to which they are exposed. Automated reliability detection systems can remove some of this burden from the user and can aid search engines, news aggregators, and social media recommendation systems in leading users to accurate and reliable content. Our submission to CLEF's CheckThat! 2023 Task 4 develops an automated news source reliability detection system.</p><p>Detecting reliability based on a subset of articles for each domain is an inherently challenging task as the lines between "high", "mixed", and "low" reliability are often blurry. It can be unclear where cut-offs between each category should lie. Authors of articles can insinuate false conspiracies or explanations, recount stories in misleading and biased ways, or ask leading questions all without ever stating a technical falsehood. Even on highly-unreliable sites, some articles often contain true or mostly-true information. For example, In the task 4 data provided by organizers, "dcclothesline", an unreliable news domain, has an article that refers to the COVID-19 vaccine as a "genocide", but also has an article that accurately, albeit with biased language, recounts a story about Rashida Tlaib falsely attributing the death of a Palestinian child to "Israeli Settlers" on Twitter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,248.53,154.71,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Several works have used web graph data and search engine optimization data to explore statistical connections between unreliable news domains as well as the approaches the domains take to manipulate search engines <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.48,195.36,11.48,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,265.47,195.36,7.52,10.91" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.50,195.36,7.65,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>. While reliability detection remains rare in the literature, other misinformation detection tasks often leverage domain-level data. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.71,208.91,12.99,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> jointly predict news media reliability as well as bias using Copula Ordinal Regression (COR) models. Many researchers use site reliability labels within a larger detection system to detect false or misleading news (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.55,249.56,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,201.63,249.56,8.14,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>)</p><p>In this work, we describe the data augmentation and fine tuning approach employed by the Accenture Team for CLEF CheckThat! Lab's Task 4. Teams were tasked with classifying websites sources as "low", "mixed", or "high" factuality from their articles and evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Label Balance</head><p>The training dataset had label bias which skewed towards sources that were "high" labeled on factuality: 61% high, 26% mixed, and 13% low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">WordPiece Analysis</head><p>Transformer models utilize WordPiece tokenization schemes that are dependant on the model being evaluated. At the time of pre-training, the WordPiece algorithm determines which pieces of words will be retained, and which will be discarded. We present our analysis in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,500.04,618.52,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the RoBERTa tokenizers we used did not return UNK tokens on any dataset provided by the CLEF CheckThat! organizers.  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,110.75,315.96,16.17,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Data Augmentation</head><p>The organizers provided a training and a development set for each language. We use the provided training set and development set to create internal training and validation sets for experimentation. We use the test set provided by organizers as a hold-out test set.</p><p>For each article, augmentation and training were done with via back-translation using AWS translation. We appended back-translated low and mixed factuality articles to the training set. In our 2021 experiment <ref type="bibr" coords="3,195.16,476.85,16.21,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, we found that this form of augmentation resulted in a significant increase in recall and F1-score for check-worthy tweets. Due to significant sample imbalance in the training sets for both task, we augmented the 0 (Low)-and 1 (Mixed)-class until the samples are roughly balanced. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,251.85,517.49,5.01,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the BLEU score for each back-translation scheme performed. BLEU score is historically used to compute the quality of machine translation by comparing machine translated text to a human translated reference. When using BLEU score for data augmentation the lower the BLEU score, the more divergent the translation to the original text, providing more diverse training data.</p><p>The number of new tokens added to the text corpus by back translation can be found in 4. Adding a large number of useful new tokens aids in diversifying the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Classification</head><p>For the RoBERTa model, we added an additional mean-pooling layer and dropout layer on top of the model prior to the final three binary classification layers, each of which corresponding to a class (i.e., 0 (Low), 1 (Mixed), or 2 (High)). The highest class probability determines the article final classification. Adding these additional layers has been shown to help prevent over-fitting while fine-tuning. We used an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2𝑒 -5 and an epsilon of 1.5𝑒 -8. We use a binary cross-entropy loss function, 4 epochs, and a batch size of 32. The majority class of all articles released by a given news source determines the level at which the news source is factual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,115.43,471.08,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows model performance on the test set provided by the organizers. The classification task reached a weighted average F1-score of 0.592. The accuracy of the classifier was 0.590. This method received a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.467 in the official evaluation.</p></div>
