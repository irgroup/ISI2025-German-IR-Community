<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The CheckThat! Lab 2023 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,204.98,357.02,12.98,9.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> included five tasks targeting various aspects of misinformation. We describe our approach to Task 1 Check-Worthiness in Multimodal and Unimodal Contents, which contained two sub-tasks. Of the two sub-tasks, we participated specifically in sub-task 1A targeting multi-modal content. The goal was to classify a tweet consisting of both text and an image as check-worthy or not. The sub-task was offered both in Arabic and English. We only developed methods for the English data.</p><p>Check-worthiness classification represents an important first triage step in a fact-checking pipeline. Successfully removing claims that are not worth checking reduces the work-load of human fact-checkers. It has been part of all CheckThat! Lab iterations so far <ref type="bibr" coords="1,450.66,465.42,11.49,9.74" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,465.02,465.42,7.52,9.74" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,475.40,465.42,7.52,9.74" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,485.79,465.42,7.52,9.74" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,496.18,465.42,7.65,9.74" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Where previously the focus was on text content, this year's sub-task 1A is a multi-modal task, involving both text and image data. This represents an important next step since much of the current content on social media is multi-modal in nature.</p><p>In this work, we will describe the approaches of our team, ZHAW-CAI, for sub-task 1A in English. We developed several different classifiers based on text only, ranging from traditional word frequency, to deep learning, and LLM solutions. We also developed a multi-modal classification model, as well as a kernel-method based ensemble model. When discussing our results, we will in particular highlight the importance of threshold selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The general problem of misinformation in social media has recieved a lot of interest from the community in recent years. Apart from the CheckThat! Lab tasks there have been tasks focusing on identifying the veracity of a claim or rumour, such as RumourEval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.91,139.50,11.29,9.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.92,139.50,8.91,9.74" target="#b7">8]</ref> and FEVEROUS <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.54,139.50,11.35,9.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>The first modern systems for check-worthiness detection include ClaimBuster <ref type="bibr" coords="2,439.80,153.05,17.76,9.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and Claim-Rank <ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.53,166.60,16.41,9.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Their main focus is on identifying check-worthy claims in political debates. The various CheckThat! Lab check-worthiness tasks have targeted different text genres, including social media and tweets in particular. While TF-IDF features are a staple of any text classification task and have been included in systems such as ClaimBuster, many successful previous participants <ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.43,220.80,16.36,9.74" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.53,220.80,13.99,9.74" target="#b12">13]</ref> used fine-tuned masked language models such as BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.41,220.80,17.83,9.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,234.35,18.07,9.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> in their solutions. We include both approaches in our solution. In terms of analysis of multi-modal social media content, the Hateful Memes challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.32,247.89,17.76,9.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> has sparked a lot of interest in the community. For the challenge of multi-modality for disinformation in particular, we refer the reader to a recent survey <ref type="bibr" coords="2,245.92,274.99,16.38,9.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The MM-Claims dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.55,274.99,18.04,9.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is a recent multi-modal claim detection dataset, on which this shared task is based. Our multi-modal sub-component is most similar to systems such as <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.92,302.09,17.96,9.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref> that use cross-attention between modalities. However, we use a full transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.90,315.64,18.02,9.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> encoder to fuse the modalities. Of course, an important recent development involves the use of large language models such as the GPT family <ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.74,329.19,17.76,9.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and LLaMa <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,342.74,17.97,9.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that exhibit astonishing zero-shot classification capabilities. We include this approach in our solutions as well. Finally, we use a multiple kernel learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,368.26,356.29,17.76,9.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref> approach to combine these disparate classifiers into a unified ensemble model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>The multi-modal check-worthiness sub-task is a binary classification task where a tweet consisting of a short text and an image has to be classified as check-worthy or not. During the development phase of the shared task, the organizers released training data (𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ), validation data (𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣 ) and a dev-test set to be used for evaluation during development (𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣-𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ). The test data 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 was released shortly before the submission deadline and its labels were only released after the submission deadline. For all our experiments, we combine the 𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣 and 𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣-𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets into a single validation set 𝐷 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 . The individual systems are trained on 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and evaluated on 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 . The sizes of these sets and their label distributions are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,435.84,544.28,3.81,9.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. We note that each sample contained both text and image data. The training and development data came from the MM-Claims dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,194.68,571.37,17.88,9.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and for the full description of the task data, we refer the reader to the task overview <ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.12,584.92,16.25,9.74" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Systems</head><p>We will now describe the different uni-modal and multi-modal systems we trained and our method to combine them using a kernel-based ensemble. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Text N-gram Classifier</head><p>Our first uni-modal system is based on the tweet text only. We first pre-process the texts by replacing URLs<ref type="foot" coords="3,159.93,255.58,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , user handles, and sequences of emoji<ref type="foot" coords="3,337.34,255.58,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_1">2</ref> by placeholder tokens. The text was then lower-cased and tokenized by splitting on white-space. Tokens shorter than 2 characters were discarded. Based on this we computed TF-IDF <ref type="bibr" coords="3,330.48,285.36,18.07,9.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref> vectors for each text. This means counting the uni-grams and bi-grams of tokens for each sample. We count only one occurrence for each n-gram, meaning we ignore repetitions. We also ignore n-grams that appear in fewer than 3 samples in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . Based on these counts one can compute the inverse document frequency (IDF) for each token. The resulting feature vectors are normalized to have unit euclidean length. We used the TfidfVectorizer implementation provided by scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,391.52,353.10,16.15,9.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We call the resulting feature vectors 𝑥 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 . We then use these feature vectors to train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,465.03,380.20,17.89,9.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref> with regularization strength of 1. We again rely on the implementation provided by scikit-learn. In particular we also employ their implementation of reweighing the classes based on their frequency in the training data which was inspired by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,328.27,420.85,16.25,9.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We will call this model text-ngram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">MLM Classifier</head><p>Next, we trained another text-only system. For this we fine-tuned an electra-base-discriminator <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,483.73,18.05,9.74" target="#b28">[29]</ref> model on the training data. Electra models have the same architecture as BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,470.32,483.73,18.05,9.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> but follow a different pre-training setup. During masked language modelling (MLM) pre-training there is both a generator network 𝐺 and a discriminator network 𝐷. During pre-training a certain number of input tokens are masked and 𝐺 has to predict the original token. The masked tokens are then replaced by those predicted by 𝐺 and 𝐷 has to determine whether a token was the original or has been replaced.</p><p>For our experiments we use the provided discriminator model checkpoint from Huggingface<ref type="foot" coords="3,501.46,562.34,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_2">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,578.57,16.41,9.74" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We show the training hyper-parameters in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,344.65,578.57,3.81,9.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. We will call the resulting model electra-clf.</p><p>In section 3.2.5 we will need access to a feature vector extracted from electra-clf. For this we remove the final dense layer of electra-clf and use the model activations as feature vectors and scale them to unit length. We will refer to these feature vectors as 𝑥 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑎 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Multi-Modal Classifier</head><p>Our multi-modal model relies on pre-trained encoder models for each modality. For text, we use the twitter-roberta-base<ref type="foot" coords="4,194.57,284.34,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_3">4</ref> checkpoint from Huggingface. This is a RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="4,419.98,287.02,17.87,9.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> model that has been pre-trained on 58M tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="4,229.97,300.57,16.09,9.74" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The output of this text encoder has dimensions 𝐿 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 × 𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 where 𝐿 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 is the number of tokens and 𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 the dimension of the token embedding.</p><p>For images, we use a Vision Transformer (ViT ) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,305.32,327.66,17.76,9.74" target="#b32">[33]</ref> that has been pre-trained on ImageNet21k <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,341.21,16.41,9.74" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. We again use a checkpoint provided by Huggingface<ref type="foot" coords="4,359.56,338.54,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . The model takes images at a 224 × 224 pixel resolution as input and processes them as a sequence of 16 × 16 pixel patches. This results in an output representation of size 𝐿 𝑖𝑚𝑔 × 𝑑 𝑖𝑚𝑔 where 𝐿 𝑖𝑚𝑔 is the number of patches and 𝑑 𝑖𝑚𝑔 the patch embedding dimension.</p><p>We first project both representations into a shared space of dimension 𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 using a dense layer and relu activation for each representation. This results in representations of sizes 𝐿 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 × 𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 and 𝐿 𝑖𝑚𝑔 × 𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 . We then concatenate them to get a new representation of size 𝐿×𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 where 𝐿 = 𝐿 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 +𝐿 𝑖𝑚𝑔 . We then feed this representation through a transformer encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,449.61,18.07,9.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and a relu activation. The transformer encoder preserves the size of the representation and we use mean pooling across the sequence length to get an embedding 𝑥 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖-𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙 of size 𝑑 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 . Finally, we normalize 𝑥 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖-𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙 to unit length and feed it through a final dense layer for classification.</p><p>We fine-tune this model on 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 but keep the weights of both the RoBERTa and the ViT encoders frozen. We call the resulting model multi-modal-clf and show its hyper-parameters in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,115.79,530.90,3.74,9.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4.">LLM Classifier</head><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the GPT family <ref type="bibr" coords="4,363.96,580.23,17.76,9.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> have shown impressive fewshot and even zero-shot classification capabilities. In particular, chain-of-thought prompting <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,607.33,16.09,9.74" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, where the model is asked to generate a step-by-step explanation how it arrives at a certain prediction, has shown much promise. Based on these observations, we constructed a very simple zero-shot classification prompt. We use the Language Model Query Language (LMQL) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,319.49,315.07,17.76,9.74" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to formulate the prompt and constrain the answers. We show the prompt written in LMQL in Listing 1. The placeholder claim is where we insert the tweet text. The placeholders ANSWER and REASON are filled in by the model. In our case we use OpenAI 's text-davinci-003 <ref type="foot" coords="5,448.42,547.11,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_5">6</ref> model. The answer is constrained to the words Yes and No which we can directly use as predictions, which we will call gpt-answer. The reasoning is constrained to be one sentence, since it should stop generating when it produces the first full stop. We apply a similar feature extraction procedure as for text-ngram in Section 3.2.1 to these reasoning sentences. We forgo any special token replacements and use n-grams up to length 3 but keep the other parameters the same. The resulting feature vectors will be called 𝑥 𝑔𝑝𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 . We then train a linear SVM on 𝑥 𝑔𝑝𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 and call it gpt-ngram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5.">Kernel Ensemble</head><p>We have seen that all our base models have an associated feature vector: 𝑥 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 , 𝑥 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑎 , 𝑥 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖-𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙 , and 𝑥 𝑔𝑝𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 . For each of these we can define a linear kernel. The kernel value for two samples 𝑖 and 𝑗 for a given system 𝑠 is then defined as 𝑘 𝑠 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝑥 𝑇 𝑠 (𝑖)𝑥 𝑠 (𝑗), where 𝑥 𝑠 (𝑖) is the feature vector of system 𝑠 for sample 𝑖. Given such a kernel 𝑘 𝑠 , we can then train an SVM. For 𝑥 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 and 𝑥 𝑔𝑝𝑡-𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 this is equivalent to their associated classifiers text-ngram and gpt-ngram. On the other hand, for 𝑥 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑎 and 𝑥 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖-𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑙 we will call the resulting SVM classifiers electra-kernel and multi-modal-kernel respectively.</p><p>We will include an additional ViT encoder based feature vector 𝑥 𝑖𝑚𝑔-𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 . It is based on the same ViT encoder as multi-modal-clf, which also provides a pooled representation for classification, which we will use as 𝑥 𝑖𝑚𝑔-𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 . We will call the resulting kernel-based SVM classifier img-untrained-kernel.</p><p>Next, we show how we combine these kernels into an ensemble. Given a set of systems 𝑆, we can define their average kernel as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,246.51,292.74,102.26,27.45">𝑘 𝑎𝑣𝑔 (𝑖, 𝑗) = ∑ 𝑠∈𝑆 1 |𝑆| 𝑘 𝑠 (𝑖, 𝑗)</formula><p>This is known as a fixed rule multiple kernel learning method <ref type="bibr" coords="6,373.74,329.36,16.41,9.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. We can then use 𝑘 𝑎𝑣𝑔 to train an SVM. Our main submission was based on this method and used an average kernel using text-ngram, gpt-ngram, electra-kernel, and multi-modal-kernel as components. We will also show results for all-kernels which additionally includes img-untrained-kernel in the average. <ref type="foot" coords="6,501.66,367.33,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_6">7</ref>All kernel-based SVMs were trained using a regularization strength of 1 and frequency based class weights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.98,455.52,5.07,9.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> we show our main results. Our submission achieved an F1 score of 0.708 on the test set. We note that if we use the default classification threshold<ref type="foot" coords="6,370.35,466.39,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_7">8</ref> electra-kernel and all-kernels achieve that exact same score. This could indicate that our ensemble method is redundant. In practice, F1 scores can be sensitive to the decision threshold. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,399.92,496.17,4.98,9.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we show the Precision and Recall Curves for each system. They show the Precision and Recall of a system for all potential thresholds. In the plot we include lines of constant F1 in light gray. We can see that the default thresholds (black cross marks) tend to select sub-optimal operating points. We could therefore try to find a better classification threshold. For this we can use the validation set 𝐷 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 and use the threshold which maximizes the F1 score on 𝐷 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 . The results are shown as red cross marks in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,265.87,577.46,5.08,9.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and in the column called Tuned Threshold in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,500.18,577.46,3.74,9.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>Since gpt-answer provides only binary outputs we can not change its threshold. The values for electra-clf and multi-modal-clf are missing since we did not compute their output on 𝐷 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 <ref type="foot" coords="6,500.69,601.88,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_8">9</ref> . We can see that for most systems this method selects an even worse threshold. We had already noticed this during development, where system performance varied greatly between 𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣 and 𝐷 𝑑𝑒𝑣-𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , and therefore we chose the default classification threshold. Finally, in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,174.26,571.34,5.12,9.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> we also include the scores that could be achieved if we had access to the ideal threshold. We computed it by selecting the threshold which maximizes the F1 score on 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 . Of course, in reality one never has access to this knowledge, but we include it here to show how much influence threshold selection can have on the system comparison.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,144.71,625.53,5.17,9.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we can also see that the curve for submission lies above the individual kernel based systems over the most recall values. Meaning that for most fixed recalls it achieves higher precision. This indicates that our ensembling method indeed yields an improved classifier. On the other hand, we can also see that electra-clf and multi-modal-clf perform even better. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,142.83,343.69,5.03,9.74" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we show the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for all our systems. We can again see that electra-clf and multi-modal-clf have the highest area under the curve (AUC), meaning that for most fixed false positive rates they have a higher true positive rate than other systems. We can also see that our ensembling method outperforms individual kernel methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have laid out our solution to the CheckThat! Lab 2023 sub-task 1A on multi-modal checkworthiness classification. Our solution includes diverse components that we combine using a multiple kernel learning approach. Our submission achieved second place out of 7 teams with an F1 score of 0.708. While analysing our results, we noted that the performance measure can vary drastically based on the selected decision threshold. When considering threshold-free methods such as ROC and PR curves, we find that our ensemble indeed seems to perform better than its individual components. Nevertheless, we note that the directly fine-tuned models outperform our submission under this lens. The performance gap between electra-clf and electra-kernel as well as multi-modal-clf and multi-modal-kernel is an open question requiring further study.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,243.64,351.13,108.00,9.74;5,116.31,367.67,37.60,9.74;5,136.47,381.22,186.47,9.74;5,136.87,394.77,42.29,9.74;5,135.09,408.32,352.52,9.74;5,156.65,421.87,89.12,9.74;5,135.74,435.42,96.21,9.74;5,136.38,448.97,115.22,9.74;5,116.40,462.51,24.33,9.74;5,136.45,476.06,148.21,9.74;5,116.29,489.61,31.09,9.74;5,135.37,503.16,134.73,9.74;5,135.91,516.71,173.82,9.74"><head>Listing 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>LMQL Prompt argmax C o n s i d e r t h e f o l l o w i n g Tweet : { c l a i m } Do you t h i n k t h i s Tweet c o n t a i n s a c l a i m t h a t i s worth f a c t -c h e c k i n g ?
