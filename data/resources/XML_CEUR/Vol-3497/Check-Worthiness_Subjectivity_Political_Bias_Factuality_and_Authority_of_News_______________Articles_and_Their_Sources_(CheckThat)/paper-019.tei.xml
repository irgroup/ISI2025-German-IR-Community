<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present an overview of CheckThat! Lab's 2023 Task 1, which is part of CLEF-2023. Task 1 asks to determine whether a text item, or a text coupled with an image, is check-worthy. This task places a special emphasis on COVID-19, political debates and transcriptions, and it is conducted in three languages: Arabic, English, and Spanish. A total of 15 teams participated, and most submissions managed to achieve significant improvements over the baselines using Transformer-based models. Out of these, seven teams participated in the multimodal subtask (1A), and 12 teams participated in the Multigenre subtask (1B), collectively submitting 155 official runs for both subtasks. Across both subtasks, approaches that targeted multiple languages, either individually or in conjunction, generally achieved the best performance. We provide a description of the dataset and the task setup, including the evaluation settings, and we briefly overview the participating systems. As is customary in the CheckThat! lab, we have release all datasets from the lab as well as the evaluation scripts to the research community. This will enable further research on finding relevant check-worthy content that can assist various stakeholders such as fact-checkers, journalists, and policymakers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fact-checking of multimodal and multigenre content is crucial to ensure the accuracy and the reliability of information shared on different communication channels such as news, political debates, and social media platforms. It helps to prevent the spread of misinformation and to promote informed decision-making. By verifying the claims in such content, individuals can make well-informed judgments and contribute to a more accurate and trustworthy online discourse.</p><p>The CheckThat! 2023 lab was held in the framework of CLEF 2023 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.50,433.58,11.23,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.27,433.58,7.42,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.23,433.58,7.49,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. <ref type="foot" coords="2,433.46,431.83,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,471.09,433.58,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the full CheckThat! identification and verification pipeline, highlighting the five tasks targeted in this fifth edition of the lab: Task 1 on detecting check-worthiness (this paper), Task 2 on subjectivity in sentences <ref type="bibr" coords="2,197.77,474.23,11.28,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and Task 3 on detecting political bias of the news articles/media <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.15,474.23,11.28,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Task 4 on detecting factuality of news media <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.34,487.78,11.34,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and Task 5 on authority finding in twitter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.49,487.78,11.34,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Task 1 ask for the detection of check-worthiness in multimodal and multigenre content. We provided manually annotated data for two subtasks in three languages: Arabic, English, and Spanish. Among the different subtasks, the check-worthiness on multigenre content was popular, with 12 teams participating. English was the most popular target language for the participants. Across the different submitted systems, transformer-based models were widely used, with XLM-RoBERTa being the most popular among the models. The top-ranked systems also employed data augmentation and additional preprocessing steps.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the different subtasks offered this year. Section 3 describes the datasets and the evaluation measures. Section 5 discusses the system submissions and the evaluation results. Section 6 presents some related work. Section 7 offers final remarks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task</head><p>The goal of this task is to assess whether a given statement, in a tweet or from a political debate, is worth fact-checking <ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.52,300.02,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In order to make that decision, one would need to ponder about questions, such as "does it contain a verifiable factual claim?" or "is it harmful?", before deciding on the final check-worthiness label <ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.12,327.11,11.59,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Task 1 is divided into two subtasks. Subtask 1A is offered in Arabic and English, Subtask 1B is offered in Arabic, English, and Spanish. Subtask 1A: Multimodality Given a tweet with the text and its corresponding image, predict whether it is worth fact-checking. Here, answers to the questions relevant for deriving a label are based on both the image and the text. The image plays two roles for check-worthiness estimation: (i) there is a piece of evidence (e.g., an event, an action, a situation, a person's identity, etc.) or illustration of certain aspects from the textual claim, and/or (ii) the image contains overlaid text that contains a claim (e.g., misrepresented facts and figures) in a textual form. Subtask 1B: Multigenre The task requires the assessment of a text snippet for check-worthiness. This snippet could be a standalone segment extracted from a variety of sources such as a tweet, a political debate, or a speech. The objective is to evaluate whether the information contained within the snippet is reliable and worthy of further fact-checking, contributing to the credibility and the integrity of the information ecosystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Datasets</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Subtask 1A: Multimodality</head><p>In subtask 1A for English, we followed the annotation schema reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,432.88,582.85,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The dataset used for the challenge was derived from <ref type="bibr" coords="3,268.08,596.40,11.32,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, with the existing data repurposed for training and development purposes, and new data developed for the evaluation. The dataset focused on three topics: COVID-19, climate change, and technology. Each tweet was labeled using both the image and the text, with OCR performed using the Google Vision API to extract the text from the images. We provided 3,175 annotated examples and around 110k unlabeled tweets of text-image pairs and OCR output to all participants. Two annotators, one expert and one new, annotated the new test set. The new annotator went through a dry run of 50 examples, where disagreements were discussed and resolved. For the final test set of 736 examples, the Cohen's Kappa inter-annotator agreement <ref type="bibr" coords="4,447.55,114.06,17.93,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was 0.49 for the check-worthiness label, indicating a moderate agreement. The expert annotator resolved any remaining disagreements for a higher quality test set.</p><p>For Subtask 1A Arabic, our data curation involved several steps for the training, the development, the dev-test, and the test datasets. For the first three partitions, we used the CT-CWT-21 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,181.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and CT-CWT-22 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,187.85,181.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> datasets, both of which had been annotated for check-worthiness and focused on topics related to COVID-19 and politics. These datasets followed the annotation schema described in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,181.89,208.91,16.43,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,201.03,208.91,7.57,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In order to develop multimodal datasets from these resources, we crawled images linked to the tweets. Since a tweet can be associated with multiple images, we only selected the first image for our study. The labels for multimodality in the first three partitions were derived from the textual modality, so these annotations can be considered as weakly labeled. For the test set, we collected tweets using similar keywords to those reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,276.66,16.42,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,108.44,276.66,7.56,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For the annotation of the test set, we followed the same annotation schema. Our three annotators had prior experiences in annotating datasets for similar tasks. We used majority voting (and sometimes discussion) to select the final labels in case of disagreements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Subtask 1B: Multigenre</head><p>The dataset for Subtask 1B consists of tweets in Arabic, English, and Spanish, as well as statements from English political debates. The Arabic tweets for Subtask 1B were collected using keywords related to COVID-19 and vaccines, using the annotation schema described in Alam et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.22,394.13,11.39,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The training, the development, and the dev-test partitions of the dataset were obtained from CT-CWT-21 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,213.53,407.68,18.04,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and CT-CWT-22 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,311.36,407.68,16.38,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For the test dataset, we used the same approach as discussed in the previous section 3.1.</p><p>The English dataset comprises sentences made by presidential election candidates during the US general election debates, annotated by human annotators <ref type="bibr" coords="4,388.09,448.32,16.41,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. While the first three partitions primarily use the same dataset described in Arslan et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,386.40,461.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, there have been some updates made to improve the quality of the annotations. The test set includes sentences that were not featured in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,182.24,488.97,16.25,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>The Spanish dataset, a combination of CT-CWT-21 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,330.09,502.52,16.29,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, CT-CWT-22 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,410.16,502.52,16.29,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, as well as newly collected content, consists of tweets from Twitter accounts and transcriptions from Spanish politicians. These were annotated by professional journalists with expertise in fact-checking.</p><p>Statistics about the datasets for Task 1 are given in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,361.98,543.17,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Across the different subtasks, dataset sizes range from 3,911 to 29,984, which are the largest so far across different languages over the years for the check-worthiness task. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,330.15,570.27,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows examples of checkworthy and non-checkworthy tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation Settings</head><p>For the lab, we provided a training, a development, and a dev-test dataset. The latter was intended to allow participants to validate their systems internally, while they could use the development set for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection. For each language and subtask, we annotated new instances, using three annotators per instance. The final label was assigned using majority voting and disagreements were resolved by a consolidator or by discussion among the annotators. The test set was used for the final evaluation and ranking. The participants were allowed to submit multiple runs on the test set (without seeing the scores), and the last valid run was considered as official.</p><p>For evaluation, we used the F 1 -measure with respect to the positive class (yes) to account for class imbalance. The data and the evaluation scripts are available online. <ref type="foot" coords="5,428.53,450.41,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> The submission system was hosted on the CodaLab platform. <ref type="foot" coords="5,289.44,463.96,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and Overview of the Systems</head><p>Fourteen teams participated in this task and submitted 35 final runs, with English being the most popular language. Below, we provide a summary of the systems submitted by the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Subtask-1A</head><p>A total of 7 and 4 teams submitted their runs for English and for Arabic, respectively, out of which four made submissions for both languages.

They trained different unimodal and multimodal systems and then combined them using a kernel-based ensemble. This ensemble was trained using an SVM for classification. For the text-based model, 𝑛-gram features were extracted separately from the tweet text, and from the prompt response from GPT-3 (Open AI's text-davinci-003), and SVMs were trained on these features. In addition, an Electra <ref type="bibr" coords="6,122.19,457.78,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> model was fine-tuned on the tweet text for classification.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We presented an overview of task 1 of the CLEF-2023 CheckThat! lab. The lab featured tasks that span the full verification pipeline: from spotting check-worthy claims to checking whether a claim has been fact-checked before. Task 1 asked to identify check-worthiness in multimodal and multigenre content. For the multimodality, notable systems used fusion of the text and the image modalities (BERT and ViT-based Vision Transformer). For the multigenre text classification, the majority of the systems fine-tuned pre-trained models, with XLM-RoBERTa being most popular. The top-performing system was based on GPT-3. In general, the current iteration of the task has encompassed a variety of strategies, involving different models such as various types of transformers.</p><p>In future work, we plan to expand the task in a variety of ways, e.g., by enlarging the dataset and by incorporating more languages.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,254.50,417.79,8.93;2,88.99,266.51,418.09,8.87;2,88.99,278.47,416.99,8.87;2,88.99,290.42,133.10,8.87;2,141.38,84.19,312.53,162.89"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The CheckThat! lab verification pipeline.
