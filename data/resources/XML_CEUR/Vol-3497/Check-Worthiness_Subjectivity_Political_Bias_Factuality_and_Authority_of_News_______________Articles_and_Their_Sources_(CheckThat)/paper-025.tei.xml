<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the challenge of detecting political bias in news articles and media outlets from CheckThat!lab Task 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.34,232.06,9.29,8.97" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,229.87,232.06,7.34,8.97" target="#b1">2]</ref> by proposing an automated method for classifying these as left, center, or right-leaning. As mass media consumption continues to grow, the capability to identify bias in news reporting is crucial due to the potential societal impact of unaddressed political bias. To tackle this issue, we present a comprehensive approach employing machine learning techniques to detect political leaning in news media and articles. Our model, CatBoost, is evaluated on a diverse dataset comprising over 55,000 news articles sourced from AllSides 1 at the article-level. For each model, we aggregate predictions made across news items by a single medium using a majority voting system at medium-level. Our dataset gathered and annotated from over 1,000 popular online platforms as rated by Media Bias/Fact Check 2 , categorizes political bias into the left, center, or right-wing. We have approximately ten articles from each of these platforms, yielding over 8,000 articles in total. We employ both CatBoost and CatBoost OF 3 for media-level classification. These effectively detect political ideology across various media sources, with our CatBoost model demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse data. Our findings suggest that utilizing the majority voting technique at the medium level improves model performance. We also highlight the importance of addressing class imbalance and implementing balanced data splits to enhance model performance. Regarding article-level classification using CatBoost, we achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.270, an F1 score of 0.690, and an accuracy of 0.694. For media-level classification, we achieve a competitive MAE of 0.320, and with the use of the majority voting classifier, our model attains an F1 score of 0.727 and an accuracy of 0.725.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The political leaning of news articles and news media has become an increasingly important topic in today's world of information overload. How news is presented and reported can have a significant impact on people's perceptions, beliefs, and even voting behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="1,448.75,547.15,11.55,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A recent study has shown that political bias may influence citizens' voting decisions and can change the voting preferences of undecided individuals at least by 20% <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.72,86.97,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Therefore, detecting the political leaning of news articles and news media has become crucial for researchers, journalists, and policymakers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.90,114.06,11.43,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in detecting the political leaning of news articles and news media is the lack of a standardized approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.78,141.16,11.58,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Researchers and journalists use various methods to determine the political leaning of news and news outlets, such as manual coding, content analysis, and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,235.13,168.26,13.10,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,251.51,168.26,7.65,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref>. However, these methods have limitations, including subjectivity, biases, and the inability to detect nuanced political perspectives. Moreover, the increasing use of social media and online news platforms has made it even more challenging to detect the political leaning of news. With the rise of user-generated content, identifying the political orientation of a particular news article or media outlet has become more complex <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,236.01,11.36,10.91" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,103.37,236.01,12.55,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.65,236.01,12.32,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>The CheckThat!lab CLEF 2023 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.61,249.56,16.30,10.91" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.30,249.56,7.42,10.91" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.12,249.56,13.95,10.91" target="#b12">13]</ref> has initiated several tasks aimed at contributing to the scientific community.

To address this issue, we propose a CatBoost framework to predict political bias, and we present the results of our model. Our research contributes to the scientific community by proposing a new system for predicting political bias in news articles and news media.

However, their method has some potential issues. Horne et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.34,606.27,17.84,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> introduced the News Landscape (NELA) Toolbox. This open-source toolkit allows for investigating news veracity using content-based indicators as a step toward automated news credibility research. Kiesel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.22,633.36,17.76,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> created a large-scale dataset for hyper-partisan news detection and organized a successful SemEval shared task, with the top team achieving a high accuracy rate. Potthast et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.43,660.46,17.85,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref> used a meta-learning approach called unmasking to evaluate style similarity between text categories, revealing significant commonalities and differences between news types, but found it inadequate for fake news identification. Rashkin et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.95,100.52,18.03,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref> conducted a study on the language of news media, contrasting the language of legitimate news with satire, hoaxes, and propaganda, and highlighted the potential of stylistic clues in assessing text veracity. Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.77,141.16,18.07,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref> developed a system using averaged word embeddings from a pre-trained ELMo model, achieving first place in a hyper-partisan news detection challenge. Barron et al. developed a model to identify propagandistic material in articles, highlighting the effectiveness of character n-grams and other style criteria over word n-grams while discussing the drawbacks of distant supervision. Martino et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,327.77,195.36,18.07,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref> proposed identifying all fragments containing propaganda techniques in a text and developed a corpus of manually annotated news articles for this purpose, demonstrating the effectiveness of a novel multi-granularity neural network.</p><p>Dinkov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,159.85,249.56,17.83,10.91" target="#b38">[39]</ref> developed a multimodal deep-learning architecture to predict the political ideology of news media by studying YouTube channels, which resulted in an extensive multimodal dataset. Another approach by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.64,276.66,12.84,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> involves assessing each document's stance towards a claim and predicting the claim's factuality while also taking into account the source's credibility. The same corpus was annotated to reflect the interdependencies between these tasks, yielding an advanced Arabic fact-checking corpus. The political bias and factual accuracy of news media have also been studied by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,233.79,330.85,16.11,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, where posture detection has been introduced as a crucial part of fact-checking systems. This study by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,288.95,344.40,17.91,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> employed information from various sources, such as media-produced pieces, Wikipedia pages, Twitter profile metadata, and online features. Lastly, the issue of assessing the bias and factuality of online news sources has been studied by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.05,385.05,16.41,10.91" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The researchers modeled the similarity between media outlets based on audience overlap, contrasting with text-based approaches. The resulting inter-media connectivity graph, processed through graph neural networks, led to better predictions of the factuality and bias of news media sources when supplemented with pre-computed representations from various platforms.</p><p>In conclusion, prior and recent research have explored various approaches for predicting the political ideology of news media, examining the general stance. Studies found that joint prediction of factuality and political bias proved more advantageous than predicting each separately <ref type="bibr" coords="3,138.35,493.44,11.45,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.53,493.44,12.58,10.91" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,167.84,493.44,12.39,10.91" target="#b37">38]</ref>. However, more than traditional bias detection methods are required to achieve highly accurate results, and a more nuanced and interdisciplinary approach is necessary for future research. As such, there is a need to undertake further research to develop and quantify more recent studies on detecting ideological biases to enhance the fundamental background of bias detection methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>In the following section, we outline our methodological approach.</p><p>TF-IDF. We used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to vectorize our text data <ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.75,633.36,16.26,10.91" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This method calculates the frequency of each term in each article and assigns a weight to each term based on its importance in the article and its frequency in the dataset. This allowed us to feed our textual data into our models and obtain a numerical K-means. We used the K-means algorithm to cluster similar articles based on their political bias <ref type="bibr" coords="4,109.23,301.53,16.09,10.91" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. This helped us better understand the distribution of political ideologies in our dataset and enabled us to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data.</p><p>CatBoost. CatBoost <ref type="bibr" coords="4,194.79,328.63,17.95,10.91" target="#b41">[42]</ref> is an open-source machine learning library developed by Yandex, designed explicitly for gradient boosting on decision trees. It offers a highly efficient and accurate approach to handling categorical features, leveraging a special algorithm to avoid target leakage, and provides numerous options for model interpretation. Its advantages include fast prediction times, robust handling of categorical variables, and a feature that allows it to handle missing data.</p><p>Majority voting. We use the majority voting technique as another approach, which is a method employed in ensemble learning <ref type="bibr" coords="4,280.09,423.47,16.55,10.91" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,299.55,423.47,14.11,10.91" target="#b43">44]</ref> by aggregating the predictions made over the news by a single medium at medium level. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,333.07,437.02,5.16,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> demonstrates the architecture of our proposed majority voting approach. It determines the final prediction for a given data point by selecting the class or outcome that receives the majority of votes from the ensemble models.</p><p>Given a set of 𝑚 classifiers, 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 , . . . , 𝐶 𝑚 , and an input data point 𝑥, each classifier makes a prediction for the class label: 𝑃 1 , 𝑃 2 , . . . , 𝑃 𝑛 . The majority voting classifier determines the final output class label 𝑃 𝑓 by selecting the class with the most votes from the individual classifier predictions.</p><p>Mathematically, the majority voting classifier can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,233.24,558.96,273.39,11.50">𝑃 𝑓 " modep𝑃 1 , 𝑃 2 , . . . , 𝑃 𝑚 q<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In this Equation <ref type="formula" coords="4,175.80,578.99,3.81,10.91" target="#formula_0">1</ref>, the mode function returns the class label that appears most frequently among the individual classifier predictions, where 𝑃 𝑓 is the final prediction.</p><p>For our task, we used hard voting, as we were afraid that the classifiers were not well calibrated, e.g., they can be over-confident in their decisions even when they are wrong; put another way, the classifier might not know when it does not know, and thus their output probability might not be usable directly. Thus, we opted for majority voting. We leave calibration and subsequent soft-voting for future work. </p></div>

Our dataset has a broad range of topics, including elections, domestic and foreign policy, finance, and others, with "elections" and "other" being the most common topics. Also, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,407.80,609.98,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the class label distribution and the number of articles in each subset. We can see that there are more articles with a right-leaning stance in almost all subsets, with fewer articles in the left-leaning category. Meanwhile, the center class remains consistently in the middle in terms of size. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experimental Setup</head><p>In this subsection, we provide a detailed description of the experimental setup for our models.</p><p>Baseline. The default experimental setup has been used for SVM model with a linear kernel.</p><p>CatBoost. For the CatBoost model, we considered the following hyperparameters: learning rate 0.1, depth 6, the maximum number of boosting iterations rate set to 10000, the best model from all iterations is selected as the final model, and the frequency of logging information during a training set to 500, which means that the training progress will be printed every 500 iterations. At medium-level, we modified the number of iterations to 2000, the learning rate to 0.05, and set the progress to log iterations to 100.</p><p>CatBoost OF. In the case of the CatBoost model using only the first 300 most important features from the TF-IDF, the experimental setup is slightly modified. The model is trained using only the top 300 most important features derived from the TF-IDF representation of the dataset, focusing on the most relevant information for the classification task. The number of iterations is set to 1000, which means the model trained for 1000 boosting rounds. This parameter determines the maximum number of trees that can be built by the model. The learning rate is set to 0.05, controlling the contribution of each tree to the ensemble model. A lower learning rate generally results in a more robust model, albeit at the expense of longer training times. The frequency of logging the training progress is set to 500 iterations, meaning that the training progress will be logged every 500 iterations, providing less frequent updates compared to the previous setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results</head><p>In this subsection, we present the results of our experiments on predicting the political bias of news articles and news outlets. We applied a majority voting ensemble approach to each model by aggregating the predictions made over the news by a single medium. The performance of the individual models and the majority voting ensemble is summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,446.43,621.57,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p><p>Baseline. The task completion's foundational system was provided by the organizers. A traditional machine learning approach Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected for this purpose.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CatBoost (Subtask A). This model consistently yielded the best results in our experiments.</head><p>In terms of MAE model reached 0.270 an F1 score 0.620 and an accuracy 0.621. This can be attributed to its robust gradient-boosting algorithm and optimized implementation for decision tree learning. Moreover, the algorithm incorporates built-in regularization techniques that help prevent overfitting and improve generalization, which is crucial for maintaining high performance on unseen data.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,133.09,627.41,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows a plot illustrating the distribution of article lengths in terms of dataset characters. Our dataset exhibits a long-tailed distribution, with most articles having symbolic lengths peaking at 100-150 and 350-500 characters.</p><p>Similarly, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,175.70,668.06,5.05,10.91" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the distribution of article lengths in terms of words in our dataset, albeit with slightly lower numbers. In our dataset, the majority of the articles have word counts within the ranges of 10-30 and 50-65 words.</p><p>The relationship between symbolic count and word count is evident; a higher symbolic length generally corresponds to a higher word count. This observation underscores the interdependence between these two factors in the structure and the content of the articles in our dataset.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the feature importance of CatBoost for classifying the political bias in news articles using our dataset. We considered five features: symbolic length, word length, lemmas, content, title, and all text. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,382.87,445.72,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. Our observations indicate that word and symbolic length were not significant features of the model. In our machine learning model, we computed feature importance using the 'SelectPercentile' method and 𝐶ℎ𝑖 2 criterion. We ranked features by 𝐶ℎ𝑖 2 scores, indicating their relevance to the target variable.</p><p>For our dataset, all text emerged as the most important feature, followed by title, content, and lemmas. Our analysis demonstrates that feature importance varies between them. It is important to note that using all text as a feature when training the model on our data accelerates the learning process.</p><p>Next, we computed a confusion matrix, which provides a convenient way to assess our model's classification performance by presenting the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class in a tabular format, allowing us to identify patterns and areas where the model may struggle. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,220.27,594.76,3.73,10.91" target="#fig_8">9</ref>, the confusion matrix for our model predictions on our dataset reveals distinct differences in performance across the political bias categories.</p><p>In our dataset, the model exhibits a substantial performance in predicting center-and rightleaning articles, whereas it struggles to classify left-leaning ones accurately.</p><p>We further investigated the performance of CatBoost a per-class level on our dataset, and the results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,208.81,662.50,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref>.  Table <ref type="table" coords="11,126.66,426.81,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref> shows the classification report for CatBoost. The model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.59, with a macro-average F1-score of 0.56 and a weighted F1-score of 0.57. It performs best in classifying center-leaning articles with an F1-score of 0.70, while it has lower F1-scores of 0.49 for both left-and right-leaning articles. Support refers to the number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset. In our case, it means the number of instances for each class ("Center", "Left", and "Right") present in the dataset. For example, there are 2959 instances of "Center", 2589 instances of "Left", and 650 instances of "Right". For "Accuracy", "Macro Avg", and "Weighted Avg", the support is the total number of instances, which is 5198 in this case.</p><p>CatBoost (Subtask B). At medium-level CatBoost also consistently achieved superior results throughout our experiments. Moreover, it reached MAE with a score of 0.320 and after applying majority voting we have solid increase in terms of an F1 score and an accuracy which are 0.727 and 0.725, respectively. The confusion matrix in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,330.98,575.85,9.94,10.91" target="#fig_9">10</ref> for the test set of the CatBoost model reveals that the model demonstrates strong predictive performance for center-leaning and rightleaning categories. However, its accuracy in predicting left-leaning instances is comparatively lower than that of the other classes.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="11,136.72,630.05,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_2">4</ref> CatBoost model demonstrates the highest precision for the left class at 0.64, followed closely by the center class at 0.63. The right class exhibits a slightly lower precision of 0.60. In terms of recall, the right class outperforms the others with a value of 0.68. The left and  center classes show recall values of 0.60 and 0.58, respectively. The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, indicates that the left class achieves a slightly better score of 0.62 compared to the center and right classes, which have F1-scores of 0.60 and 0.63, respectively. The overall accuracy of the CatBoost model stands at 0.62, while the macro and weighted averages for precision, recall, and F1-score are also equal to 0.62.</p><p>CatBoost OF. The CatBoos OF model incorporates the top 300 most important features derived from the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method. Despite a relatively modest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.375, an F1 score of 0.537, and an accuracy of 0.538, the model exhibited less favorable results compared to other CatBoost models, securing the bottom position. This held true even when a majority voting approach was applied to enhance the performance of our model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>During the initial stage of our analysis, we observed that our dataset exhibited an unbalanced distribution of classes. To investigate the impact of balanced splits on model performance, we created train, test, and development sets with balanced class distributions. Our findings revealed that using balanced splits led to improved results, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="13,409.52,424.62,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_3">5</ref>. This suggests that balancing the dataset can contribute to more accurate and reliable predictions. Upon conducting a comparative analysis of the BERT and CatBoost models, we have chosen to implement the CatBoost model in our experiments. This decision was guided by its demonstrably superior performance compared to BERT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We explored predicting the political bias of news articles and news media using a dataset comprising 55,000 news articles and over 1,000 news media sources with over 8,000 articles. We proposed a new model, CatBoost, which was used to determine the political leaning. Furthermore, we employed the majority voting technique to enhance our model's performance at the media level. Our approach effectively classified the political bias, yielding consistent results. The CatBoost model trained on our article-level dataset achieved a classification accuracy of 0.690, an F1 score of 0.694, and a MAE of 0.270. When the model was applied to the medium-level, it reached an MAE of 0.320.</p><p>By implementing the majority voting classifier, which aggregates the predictions made over the news by a single medium, we achieved an enhanced F1 score of 0.727 and an accuracy of 0.725. Our comprehensive experiments showed that CatBoost consistently performed effectively. However, the CatBoost OF model delivered the least effective results on the media-level dataset. We noticed that applying majority voting to the news from a single medium improved each model's performance.</p><p>In future work, we aim to explore topic-level bias prediction and move beyond the left-centerright political bias classification. This may require collecting additional labels and breaking away from the current 3-way classification. Furthermore, we intend to carry out cross-language experiments to adapt these methods to languages other than English. Another potential area of investigation is predicting veracity and political leaning simultaneously, necessitating the development of models incorporating both textual and non-textual features, such as source credibility or author reputation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,90.62,287.16,8.93;4,213.06,106.51,166.67,145.21"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Majority voting architecture.
