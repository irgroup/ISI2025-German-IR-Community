<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents our participation in the CLEF2023 CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,394.77,223.09,9.47,8.97" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, focusing on Task 5, which addresses Authority Finding in Twitter [2]. This study addresses the gap in rumor verification by exploring the use of Bio and Lists information from trusted authorities' bios as evidence sources in social media. A Twitter Bio is a brief description or introduction about oneself or an organization displayed on a user's profile, providing a snapshot of their identity, interests, or purpose. Twitter Lists are curated groups of Twitter accounts created by users to organize and categorize specific individuals or topics for easy viewing and engagement. Previous research has primarily focused on propagation networks and user-generated content. The findings highlight the potential of incorporating Bio and Lists information to enhance existing rumor verification systems. Additionally, the study evaluates different retrieval approaches, showing that combining Bio and Lists information leads to effective lexical retrieval. A hybrid approach combining lexical and semantic retrieval further improves performance. These findings contribute to advancing rumor verification methods in social media.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Previous research on rumor verification in social media has primarily focused on using propagation networks as a source of evidence, examining reply stances <ref type="bibr" coords="1,381.09,458.88,11.39,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, reply structures <ref type="bibr" coords="1,471.72,458.88,11.39,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and retweeters profile features <ref type="bibr" coords="1,207.43,472.43,11.33,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, according to <ref type="bibr" coords="1,327.52,472.43,11.33,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where they constructed a dataset for the purpose, no prior studies have explored the use of evidence from the timelines of trusted authorities, defined as "entities with the actual knowledge or power to confirm or refute a particular rumor, for rumor verification in social media" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,284.23,514.09,13.91,9.72" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Identifying the stance of relevant authorities regarding rumors can significantly enhance the evidence sources used by current rumor verification systems. Additionally, it can be a useful tool for fact-checkers to automate the process of examining authority tweets for rumor verification. It's important to note that while the stance of authorities can be a valuable source of evidence, it should complement other sources and may not always be entirely reliable for determining the truthfulness of rumors on its own. The task of expert finding, which aims to identify individuals with relevant expertise in a particular domain, has gained significant attention in recent years <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.66,100.52,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Previous research in this area has often focused on incorporating spatial information to address the expert-finding problem. For example, McDonald et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.63,127.61,11.73,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> conducted a study in a medium-sized software company to develop a system that cataloged people's expertise, aiming to facilitate the process of locating experts. In a similar vein, Dom et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.91,154.71,16.00,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a graph-based ranking algorithm for expert finding by analyzing email communications. Their approach incorporated link analysis techniques, assigning each email owner a node with a score derived from PageRank and HITS algorithms. Campbell et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,384.61,195.36,15.92,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> compared two methods for identifying expertise within email communities. The first method focused solely on email text content, while the second method utilized a graph-based ranking algorithm considering both text and communication patterns. The expert search task was introduced in TREC 2005 Enterprise track <ref type="bibr" coords="2,159.60,249.56,17.20,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, with the top-performing approach, THUENT0505, utilizing all W3C web part information, email Lists, and in-link anchor text of related files, then restructuring text content to form description files for each potential expert.</p><p>Pal and Counts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,171.64,290.20,18.05,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a probabilistic clustering framework that utilized nodal and topical features to identify authoritative experts in a given topic. Ghosh et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.89,303.75,16.31,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> developed the Cognos system, which utilized Twitter Lists to determine user expertise and demonstrated comparable performance to Twitter's official system in identifying top users for specific topics. Additionally, Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,193.90,344.40,16.29,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> investigated the use of multiple types of relationships on Twitter to identify experts associated with a particular topic. Studies, such as the one referenced in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,371.50,16.39,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, integrate user-related Twitter data to improve expert finding outcomes. They employ a semi-supervised graph ranking technique to rank expertise levels.</p><p>The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the data employed in this study, Section 3 elucidates the ranking metrics to enhance the understanding of the results, Section 4 presents the proposed methodology, Section 5 offers the experimental results and in-depth discussions, and finally, Section 6 concludes the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data overview</head><p>In this section, we present the Authority Finder in Twitter dataset provided as part of the CheckThat! 2023 competition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.92,511.42,11.36,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,238.00,511.42,7.57,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Given a tweet stating a rumor, we retrieve a ranked list of authorities that may help verify the rumor. The dataset is available in Arabic only, and it's composed of the following:</p><p>• Rumors: The data is in a JSON format. It contains JSON objects representing rumors.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,147.63,574.58,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the different entries for each rumor. • Relevance Judgments (Qrels): The file is a TAB-separated file in TREC format. Each rumor ID is associated with user IDs of the authorities. The file is in the following format:</p><p>-rumor_id: Unique ID for the given rumor -0: Literally 0 (this column is needed to comply with the TREC format).</p><p>-user_id: Unique ID for the given authority.  relevance: 2 if the authority is highly relevant to the rumor (has higher priority to be contacted); 1 if it is relevant; 0 is assumed for all pairs not appearing in the qrels file.</p><p>• Users Metadata: It has a collection of 1000 JSON files.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Proposed method</head><p>Our methodology consists of several steps inspired by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,333.76,111.28,16.30,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, including preprocessing, creating user documents, indexing and retrieval, and incorporating lexical and semantic scoring for ranking users. Below is a description of each step in the process:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Indexing and Retrieval</head><p>We used Pyserini<ref type="foot" coords="5,166.53,185.99,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , a Python toolkit for information retrieval, to index our user collection for lexical retrieval. We experimented using different values of BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,383.28,201.29,17.91,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> parameters. We set the language to Arabic and performed normalization on both documents and queries. The Lucene Arabic analyzer was employed for stemming and removing stop words. As our queries (rumors) are expressed in tweets, we preprocessed the data by discarding URLs, emojis, and non-Arabic characters. We considered three types of user representation indexes:</p><p>• Bio_index: each user is represented by their translated Twitter profile name and description. • Lists_index: each user is represented by concatenating their translated Twitter list names and descriptions. • Bio_lists_index: each user is represented by concatenating their translated Twitter profile name and description with their translated Twitter Lists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Lexical Retrieval</head><p>We employed the BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,193.88,396.81,17.76,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> retrieval model to compute the lexical score 𝑆𝑥 for a candidate user 𝑢 given a rumor 𝑟, considering only the textual representation of users. The BM25 algorithm calculates a term-weighted score for a given document-query pair as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,139.19,447.36,367.45,30.29">𝐵𝑀 25(𝑡 𝑢 , 𝑡 𝑟 ) = ∑︁ 𝑖∈𝑡𝑟∩𝑡𝑢 𝐼𝐷𝐹 (𝑞 𝑖 ) • (𝑘 1 + 1) • 𝑓 (𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑢 ) 𝑘 1 • ((1 -𝑏) + 𝑏 • |𝑡𝑢| 𝑎𝑣𝑔𝑑𝑙 ) + 𝑓 (𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑢 )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where 𝑡 𝑢 and 𝑡 𝑟 are the textual representations of the user 𝑢 and rumor 𝑟, respectively, 𝑓 (𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑢 ) is the frequency of term 𝑞 𝑖 in the user document 𝑡 𝑢 , |𝑡 𝑢 | is the length of the user document, 𝑎𝑣𝑔𝑑𝑙 is the average document length in the collection, and 𝐼𝐷𝐹 (𝑞 𝑖 ) is the inverse document frequency of term 𝑞 𝑖 . The parameters 𝑘 1 and 𝑏 control the term frequency saturation and field-length normalization, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Initial Retrieval</head><p>Assuming authoritative users have more followers and are involved in more Twitter Lists than regular users. We computed the initial score 𝑆 𝑖 (𝑢, 𝑟) by incorporating the number of Twitter Lists, followers, and users as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,196.10,636.95,310.53,25.50">𝑆 𝑖 (𝑢, 𝑟) = 𝑆 𝑥 (𝑢, 𝑟) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔 2 [(𝑙 𝑢 + 2)( 𝑓 𝑢 𝑤 𝑢 + 2)]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑙 𝑢 is the number of Twitter Lists the candidate is a member of, 𝑓 𝑢 is the number of followers the candidate has, and 𝑤 𝑢 is the number of users the candidate is following. We added 2 when computing the logarithm of both factors for smoothing in case 𝑙 𝑢 or 𝑓 𝑢 is zero. In any of those cases, the initial score will fall back to the lexical score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Semantic Reranking</head><p>Contextualized transformer-based models such as BERT that are pre-trained on large corpora have shown superiority in document reranking. Given that, we also employed a semantic reranking approach based on BERT to re-rank the initial retrieved users, using the same technique as <ref type="bibr" coords="6,147.70,217.98,17.87,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for the generation of input data. Practically we used three pretrained Arabic models:</p><p>• AraBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,165.08,254.01,16.09,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a BERT-based language model, is optimized for Arabic NLP tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in sentiment analysis, and text classification. • ArBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,160.83,282.45,17.93,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is a large-scale pre-trained masked language model for Modern Standard Arabic, based on BERT-base architecture, with 163 million parameters. • MARBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,174.66,310.90,18.05,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is an Arabic language model pre-trained on a diverse Twitter dataset specifically designed to handle Arabic dialect variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Hybrid Reranking</head><p>As the initial score incorporates user profile features like the count of Twitter Lists, followers, and followees, which are crucial in measuring user popularity, we adopted an existing hybrid approach <ref type="bibr" coords="6,133.95,401.27,16.37,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, that combines both the initial and semantic scores to compute a final score of candidate users as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="6,194.37,439.89,312.27,13.53">𝑆 ℎ (𝑢, 𝑟) = 𝛼 × 𝑆 𝑖 ˆ(𝑢, 𝑟) + (1 -𝛼) × 𝑆 𝑠 (𝑢, 𝑟),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1] is a weight that indicates the relative importance of each score, and 𝑆 𝑖 ˆ(𝑢, 𝑟) is the normalized initial score using min-max normalization per rumor. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage both lexical and semantic information along with user profile features to better identify authoritative users for Arabic rumors. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,358.91,502.57,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the whole process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussion</head><p>The results presented in this study were obtained using the Development Dataset prior to the release of the Test dataset, with the objective of identifying the most appropriate configuration to be employed during the evaluation phase. This pre-release assessment aimed to discern the optimal setup for subsequent evaluations and ensure the reliability and validity of the findings.</p><p>The following tables (2 3 4 5) show the results of the different previously mentioned steps of ranking.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,128.25,642.48,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> (Lexical Retrieval): The table compares the performance of three different index approaches (Bio Index, Lists Index, and Bio Lists Index) using various combinations of the parameters k1 and b. We used Gready-Search to evaluate the optimal configuration of BM25,  where k1 ∈ <ref type="bibr" coords="7,143.28,543.84,11.52,9.57" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,156.61,543.84,8.49,9.57" target="#b3">4]</ref> with a step of 0.1, and b ∈ [0.1, 0.4] with a step of 0.1. The best-performing lexical model was the one utilizing the Bio Lists index and setting the BM25 parameters k1 and b to 3 and 0.1, respectively, resulting in P@1=0.2750, P@5=0.1383, and nDCG@5=0.1865. This indicates that combining the Bio and Lists information led to the most effective retrieval strategy. It is important to note that the results for parameter values of 𝑏 = 0.3 and 𝑏 = 0.4, including the default parameters for Pyserini with 𝑘1 = 0.9 and 𝑏 = 0.4, were not reported in this study due to their relatively moderate performance.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="7,138.58,637.95,3.70,10.91" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we present the results of the initial retrieval using the Lists and Bio Lists indexes, where we adopted the optimal BM25 parameter settings (k1=3 and b=0.1). The Bio Lists Index yielded better results, with P@1=0.3500, P@5=0.1667, and nDCG@5=0.2345, further demonstrating the benefit of combining Bio and Lists information and it shows the importance of using user network features.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="8,140.54,410.12,3.81,10.91">4</ref>, we present the semantic reranking results using three Arabic-language BERT models (AraBERT, ArBERT, and MARBERT) with the initial retrieval results from Table <ref type="table" coords="8,478.21,423.67,3.71,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The initial retrieval outperformed all the semantic models in terms of P@1, P@5, and nDCG@5, suggesting that the lexical approach is more effective than the semantic approach in this case.</p><p>The hybrid retrieval results of reranking the top 100 candidate users from the initial retrieval (Bio+Lists) by interpolating initial and semantic scores are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,470.11,477.87,3.76,10.91">5</ref>. MAR-BERT performed the best among the semantic models, with P@1=0.3445, P@5=0.1835, and nDCG@5=0.2427, demonstrating that the hybrid approach combining lexical and semantic retrieval can lead to better performance than using either method alone.</p><p>During the evaluation cycle, an attempt was made to employ Hybrid reranking with MAR-BERT. However, the limited availability of computational resources hindered the production of the necessary results within the specified evaluation cycle deadline. As a result, the submission solely consisted of the results obtained using Initial Retrieval with the optimal configuration of BM25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This study evaluates different retrieval approaches for authority finding, where each user is represented by their translated Twitter profile name and description (Bio index) or by the translated Twitter list names and descriptions (Lists index) or combined (Bio-Lists index). The findings indicate combining Bio and Lists information leads to the most effective lexical retrieval strategy. The initial retrieval process demonstrates the superiority of the Bio Lists Index over the Lists Index, emphasizing the importance of incorporating Bio and Lists information. Moreover, the results showed that both lexical and initial retrieval models outperformed all the semantic retrieval models. However, a hybrid approach combining lexical and semantic retrieval, particularly using the MARBERT model, shows improved performance.
