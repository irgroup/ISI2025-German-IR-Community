<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article provides an overview of eRisk 2023, the seventh edition of the CLEF conference's lab dedicated to early risk detection. Our lab has been committed to exploring evaluation methodologies, effectiveness metrics, and other associated processes in the field of early risk detection since its inception. The applications of early alerting models are wide-ranging and span various domains, including health and safety. eRisk 2023 encompassed three tasks. The initial task involved ranking sentences based on their relevance to standardized depression symptoms. The second task concentrated on detecting signs associated with pathological gambling early. Lastly, the third task required participants to automatically estimate an eating disorders questionnaire by analyzing user writings on social media. In this extended overview, we include additional details about the participants' proposals and more detailed explanations about metrics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The main objective of eRisk is to investigate evaluation methodologies, metrics, and other pertinent factors about research collection development and identifying signs associated with early risk detection. The potential of early detection technologies is significant, particularly in fields that address safety and health applications.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task 1: Search for Symptoms of Depression</head><p>Task 1 introduced a novel challenge in 2023 involving the production of sentence rankings based on their relevance to specific symptoms of depression. We instructed participants to rank sentences derived from user writings according to their relevance to the 21 standardized symptoms outlined in the BDI-II Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.02,538.52,16.40,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In this context, a sentence was deemed relevant to a particular symptom if it provided information about the user's state of that symptom. It is important to emphasize that a phrase could be considered relevant even if it conveyed positive information about the symptom. For instance, "I feel quite happy lately" should be regarded as relevant for symptom 1, "Sadness, " in the BDI-II.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Dataset and format</head><p>The corpus provided to the participants was a TREC formatted sentence-tagged dataset (based on eRisk's past data). Table <ref type="table" coords="2,213.09,655.99,5.07,10.91">1</ref> reports some statistics of the corpus.  Given the corpus of sentences and the description of the symptoms from the BDI questionnaire, the participants were free to decide on the best strategy to derive queries for representing the BDI symptoms. Each participating team submitted up to 5 variants (runs). Each run included 21 TREC-style formatted rankings of sentences, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,377.76,544.62,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Assessment Process</head><p>For each symptom, the participants could should submit up to 1000 results sorted by estimated relevance. We received 37 runs from 10 participating teams (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,402.46,607.89,3.57,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). The generation of relevance judgments involved the participation of three expert assessors who annotated a pool of sentences associated with each symptom. We selected the candidate sentences using a top-k pooling process using the participants' submissions ( 37 different ranking methods)</p><p>The assessors were provided with explicit instructions regarding the determination of sentence relevance. They were instructed to consider a sentence relevant if it pertained to the symptom and provided explicit information about the individual's state in relation to it. This dual concept of relevance, encompassing both the topic and the reflection of the user's state, introduced a higher complexity level than more conventional relevance assessments. As a result, we developed a robust annotation methodology and formal assessment guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy. To create the pool of sentences for assessment, we employed 𝑘 = 50 in the pooling method. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,194.63,181.81,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref> presents the resulting pool sizes per sentence. It was observed that certain sentences had identical text but different IDs, potentially stemming from multiple users writing the same content. To reduce the assessors' workload, we automated removing duplicate sentences. The annotation software, specifically developed to support the annotation process of eRisk 2023, automatically assigned the assessors' relevance labels to all identical sentences. Despite implementing these optimizations, the average time spent per sentence by the three assessors was still over 30 seconds, even for this sentences that are very short documents. These resulted in more than 210 hours of assessors' time.  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,198.67,399.15,10.61,9.96" target="#b4">(5)</ref> 829 794 83 Punishment Feelings <ref type="bibr" coords="4,222.25,411.10,10.61,9.96" target="#b5">(6)</ref> 1079 1036 21 50 Self-Dislike <ref type="bibr" coords="4,183.40,423.06,10.61,9.96" target="#b6">(7)</ref> 1005 957 158 Self-Criticalness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,203.36,435.01,10.61,9.96" target="#b7">(8)</ref> 1072 1023 76 Suicidal Thoughts or Wishes <ref type="bibr" coords="4,253.96,446.97,10.61,9.96" target="#b8">(9)</ref> 953 923 260 Crying <ref type="bibr" coords="4,165.06,458.92,15.24,9.96" target="#b9">(10)</ref> 983 917 230 Agitation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,174.87,470.88,15.24,9.96" target="#b10">(11)</ref> 1080 1057 69 Loss of Interest <ref type="bibr" coords="4,199.25,482.83,15.24,9.96" target="#b11">(12)</ref> 1077 1021 70 Indecisiveness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,195.02,494.79,15.24,9.96" target="#b12">(13)</ref> 1110 1044 61 Worthlessness <ref type="bibr" coords="4,195.39,506.74,15.24,9.96" target="#b13">(14)</ref> 1067 986 71 Loss of Energy <ref type="bibr" coords="4,196.54,518.70,15.24,9.96" target="#b14">(15)</ref> 1082 1027 129 Changes in Sleeping Pattern <ref type="bibr" coords="4,253.23,530.65,15.24,9.96" target="#b15">(16)</ref> 938 904 203 Irritability <ref type="bibr" coords="4,178.56,542.61,15.24,9.96" target="#b16">(17)</ref> 1047 1008 94 Changes in Appetite <ref type="bibr" coords="4,220.55,554.56,15.24,9.96" target="#b17">(18)</ref> 984 947 103 Concentration Difficulty <ref type="bibr" coords="4,237.15,566.52,15.24,9.96" target="#b18">(19)</ref> 1024 981 83 Tiredness or Fatigue <ref type="bibr" coords="4,219.84,578.48,15.24,9.96" target="#b19">(20)</ref> 1033 994 123 Loss of Interest in Sex <ref type="bibr" coords="4,226.21,590.43,15.24,9.96" target="#b20">(21)</ref> 971 922 97</p><p>The annotation process involved a team of three assessors with diverse backgrounds and expertise. One assessor was a psychologist, while the other two were computer science researchers-a postdoctoral fellow and a PhD student-specialised in early-risk technologies.</p><p>The lab organisers conducted a preparatory session with the assessors to ensure consistency and clarity. During this session, an initial version of the guidelines was discussed, and any doubts or questions raised by the assessors were thoroughly addressed. Through this collaborative effort, the final version of the guidelines shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,316.18,114.06,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_2">2</ref> was developed.

Following these guidelines, a sentence is deemed relevant only if it provides "some information about the state of the individual related to the topic of the BDI item." This criterion serves as the foundation for determining the relevance of sentences during the annotation process.</p><p>After the initial meeting, the assessors proceeded to label the pools of sentences for the first three BDI topics (sadness, pessimism, and past failure). Following this phase, we organized another meeting to address any additional concerns or questions that arose during the annotation process. This collaborative session was vital in refining the annotation criteria and ensuring consistency. The final outcomes of the annotation process, including the number of relevant sentences per BDI item, are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,291.78,181.81,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref> (last two columns). We applied two aggregation criteria for sentence relevance determination: unanimity and majority.</p><p>The performance results of the participating systems are presented in Tables 4 (majority-based qrels) and 5 (unanimity-based qrels). These tables show results for multiple standard ranking metrics, namely Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean R-Precision, mean Precision at 10, and mean NDCG at 1000. Notably, Formula-ML models based on setence transformers, developed by the NITK Surathkal team, achieved the highest performance rankings across all metrics and relevance judgment types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task 2: Early Detection of Pathological Gambling</head><p>This task marks the third edition of the challenge, which aims to develop innovative models for the early identification of pathological gambling risk. Pathological gambling, also known as ludomania or "gambling addiction, " involves an irresistible urge to gamble despite the adverse consequences. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of adult gambling addiction in 2017 ranged from 0.1% to 6.0% <ref type="bibr" coords="6,333.33,389.48,16.41,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The objective of this task was to process evidence in a sequential manner and detect early indications of compulsive or disordered gambling as promptly as possible. Participating systems were required to analyze user posts on social media in the order of their occurrence. Successful outcomes from this task could potentially be employed for sequential monitoring of user interactions across diverse online platforms such as blogs, social networks, and other forms of digital media. The test collection employed for this task followed the same format as the collection described in the work by Losada and Crestani <ref type="bibr" coords="6,244.57,484.32,16.09,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. This collection comprises writings, including posts and comments, obtained from a carefully selected group of social media users. Within this dataset, users are classified into two categories: pathological gamblers and non-pathological gamblers.</p><p>For each user, the collection contains a chronological sequence of writings. To facilitate the task and ensure equitable distribution, we established a dedicated server that systematically provided user writings to the participating teams. Further details regarding the setup and functioning of the server can be found on the lab's official website <ref type="foot" coords="6,317.38,563.86,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . This task followed a train-test approach. During the training stage, teams were provided with training data, including the complete history of writings for training users. We indicated which users explicitly identified themselves as pathological gamblers, allowing participants to tune their systems using this training data. In 2023, the training data for Task 1 consisted of users from previous editions of the self-harm task. During the test stage, participants connected to our server and engaged in an iterative process of receiving user writings and sending their responses. Participants had the discretion to pause the process and issue an alert at any point in the chronology of user writings. After reading each user's writing, teams had to decide between two options: i) issuing an alert about the user, indicating a predicted sign of gambling risk, or ii) not issuing an alert. Each participant independently made this choice for every user in the test split. It is important to note that once an alert was issued, it was considered final, and no further decisions regarding that particular individual were taken into account. On the other hand, we did not consider the absence of alerts as final, allowing participants to subsequently submit an alert if they detected emerging signs of risk.</p><p>In constructing the ground truth assessments, we employed established approaches that aim to optimize the utilization of assessors' time <ref type="bibr" coords="8,287.40,602.81,16.41,10.91" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,306.53,602.81,12.31,10.91" target="#b31">32]</ref>. These methods utilize simulated pooling strategies, which facilitate the efficient creation of test collections. The key statistics of the test collection used for Task 2 are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,306.81,629.91,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. . To evaluate the performance of the systems, we used two indicators: the accuracy of the decisions made and the number of user writings required to reach those decisions. These criteria offer valuable insights into the evaluated systems' effectiveness and efficiency. To support the test stage, the server distributed user writings iteratively and waited for responses from participants. Importantly, new user data was only provided to a specific participant after the service received the response from previous evidence from that particular team. The submission period for the task was open from January 16th, 2023, until April 14th, 2023.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Decision-based Evaluation</head><p>This form of evaluation revolves around the (binary) decisions taken for each user by the participating systems. Besides standard classification measures (Precision, Recall and F1<ref type="foot" coords="9,497.22,327.69,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> ), we computed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, the early risk detection error used in previous editions of the lab. A full description of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,282.90,356.54,16.38,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Essentially, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is an error measure that introduces a penalty for late correct alerts (true positives). The penalty grows with the delay in emitting the alert, and the delay is measured here as the number of user posts that had to be processed before making the alert.</p><p>Since 2019, we complemented the evaluation report with additional decision-based metrics that try to capture additional aspects of the problem. These metrics try to overcome some limitations of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, namely:</p><p>• the penalty associated to true positives goes quickly to 1. This is due to the functional form of the cost function (sigmoid). • a perfect system, which detects the true positive case right after the first round of messages (first chunk), does not get error equal to 0. • with a method based on releasing data in a chunk-based way (as it was done in 2017 and 2018) the contribution of each user to the performance evaluation has a large variance (different for users with few writings per chunk vs users with many writings per chunk). • 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is not interpretable. Some research teams have analysed these issues and proposed alternative ways for evaluation. Trotzek and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="9,191.55,601.31,17.76,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . This is a variant of ERDE that does not depend on the number of user writings seen before the alert but, instead, it depends on the percentage of user writings seen before the alert. In this way, user's contributions to the evaluation are normalized (currently, all users weight the same). However, there is an important limitation of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . In real life applications, the overall number of user writings is not known in advance. Social Media users post contents online and screening tools have to make predictions with the evidence seen. In practice, you do not know when (and if) a user's thread of messages is exhausted. Thus, the performance metric should not depend on knowledge about the total number of user writings. Another proposal of an alternative evaluation metric for early risk prediction was done by Sadeque and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="10,195.19,168.26,16.10,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. They proposed 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 , which fits better with our purposes. This measure is described next. Imagine a user 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 and an early risk detection system that iteratively analyzes 𝑢's writings (e.g. in chronological order, as they appear in Social Media) and, after analyzing 𝑘 𝑢 user writings (𝑘 𝑢 ≥ 1), takes a binary decision 𝑑 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, which represents the decision of the system about the user being a risk case. By 𝑔 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, we refer to the user's golden truth label. A key component of an early risk evaluation should be the delay on detecting true positives (we do not want systems to detect these cases too late). Therefore, a first and intuitive measure of delay can be defined as follows <ref type="foot" coords="10,227.34,274.90,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="10,184.61,310.61,322.03,12.74">latency 𝑇 𝑃 = median{𝑘 𝑢 : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This measure of latency is calculated over the true positives detected by the system and assesses the system's delay based on the median number of writings that the system had to process to detect such positive cases.

This is calculated by multiplying F by a penalty factor based on the median delay. More specifically, each individual (true positive) decision, taken after reading 𝑘 𝑢 writings, is assigned the following penalty:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="10,202.86,561.13,303.77,24.89">𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) = -1 + 2 1 + exp -𝑝•(𝑘𝑢-1)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 is a parameter that determines how quickly the penalty should increase. In <ref type="bibr" coords="10,457.82,593.36,16.11,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, 𝑝 was set such that the penalty equals 0.5 at the median number of posts of a user 5 . Observe that a decision right after the first writing has no penalty (i.e. 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(1) = 0). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,453.60,86.97,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_3">3</ref> plots how the latency penalty increases with the number of observed writings. The system's overall speed factor is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="11,158.27,322.03,348.37,11.36">𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 = (1 -median{𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1})<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where speed equals 1 for a system whose true positives are detected right at the first writing. A slow system, which detects true positives after hundreds of writings, will be assigned a speed score near 0.</p><p>Finally, the latency-weighted F score is simply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="11,244.56,423.97,262.08,11.50">𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝐹 • 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Since 2019 user's data were processed by the participants in a post by post basis (i.e. we avoided a chunk-based release of data). Under these conditions, the evaluation approach has the following properties:</p><p>• smooth grow of penalties; • a perfect system gets 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 1 ;</p><p>• for each user 𝑢 the system can opt to stop at any point 𝑘 𝑢 and, therefore, now we do not have the effect of an imbalanced importance of users; • 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 is more interpretable than 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Ranking-based Evaluation</head><p>In addition to the evaluation discussed above, we employed an alternative form of evaluation to further assess the systems. After each data release (new user writing), participants were required to provide the following information for each user in the collection:</p><p>• A decision for the user (alert or no alert), which was used to calculate the decision-based metrics discussed previously. • A score representing the user's level of risk, estimated based on the evidence observed thus far.</p><p>The scores were used to create a ranking of users in descending order of estimated risk. For each participating system, a ranking was generated at each data release point, simulating a continuous re-ranking approach based on the observed evidence. In a real-life scenario, this ranking would be presented to an expert user who could make decisions based on the rankings (e.g., by inspecting the top of the rankings). Each ranking can be evaluated using standard ranking metrics such as P@10 or NDCG. Therefore, we report the performance of the systems based on the rankings after observing different numbers of writings</p></div>

For this task, our focus was on questions 1-12 and 19-28 from the EDE-Q. This questionnaire is specifically designed to assess various aspects and the severity of features associated with eating disorders.

The main objective of this task was to investigate the feasibility of automatically estimating the severity of multiple symptoms associated with eating disorders. The participating algorithms estimated the user's response to each question based on their writing history. To evaluate the performance of the systems, we collected questionnaires completed by users on social media, along with their corresponding writing history.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Participating Teams</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="19,116.02,594.90,10.25,10.91" target="#tab_0">12</ref> reports the participating teams and the runs that they submitted for each eRisk task.</p><p>The next paragraphs give a brief summary on the techniques implemented by each of them. Further details are available at the CLEF 2023 working notes proceedings for the participants. BFH-AMI <ref type="bibr" coords="19,137.68,636.49,17.65,9.76" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The BFH-AMI team, affiliated with Applied Machine Intelligence of Switzerland, participated in Task 3 of the eRisk 2023 challenge. The team employed a logistic regression model that incorporated user and question embeddings derived from the Large Language Models. To address the challenge, the authors employed two different models, namely BERT and GPT-Large, to generate embeddings for users' posts and publications. These embeddings were then utilized as input features for the logistic regression model. The aim was to capture the underlying patterns and information within the social media writing history of patients that could help predict their responses to the EDE-Q. The use of logistic regression allowed the team to build a predictive model that could estimate the likelihood of different responses based on the extracted features. By incorporating user and question embeddings the model could effectively leverage the semantic information and context within the social media writings. BLUE <ref type="bibr" coords="20,119.63,528.19,17.68,9.76" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The BLUE team participated in Task 1 of the eRisk 2023 challenge. Their approach involved using dense retrievers for semantic search, with the aim of retrieving relevant sentences from a collection. They employed two types of queries for the search process. First, they utilized the descriptions of each symptom found in the BDI-II questionnaire. These symptom descriptions served as queries for the search. Additionally, they leveraged ChatGPT, a language model, to generate synthetic queries for each symptom in the BDI-II questionnaire. The team believed that using ChatGPT to generate synthetic queries would introduce more diversity in expressions and potentially yield more relevant sentences during the search process. The team conducted five runs of their approach and employed two transformer-based models for embedding the social media posts. These models were the original and generated responses of the BDI-II, MentalRoBERTa, and a variant of MPNet. Surprisingly, the model that performed semantic search using the initial responses from the BDI-II questionnaire as queries achieved better performance compared to the model using generated queries. Furthermore, it was observed that the generated synthetic data was too specific for this particular task. BioNLP-IISERB <ref type="bibr" coords="21,171.35,438.37,18.00,9.76" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. BioNLP-IISERB participated in Task 2 of the challenge. The team submitted five different runs, employing various text-mining frameworks and strategies for text classification and feature engineering. To extract features from the social media posts, BioNLP-IISERB utilized both traditional and transformer-based approaches. They employed the bag of words model, specifically TF-IDF weighting, as well as transformer-based embeddings such as BERT, Longformer, and RoBERTa. For the classification stage, the team explored several classifiers to determine their effectiveness in the task. They utilized classifiers such as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and transformer-based classifiers. Among their different approaches, BioNLP-IISERB found that combining a Support Vector Machine and an Adaptive Boosting classifier yielded their most successful performance. ELiRF-UPV <ref type="bibr" coords="21,149.33,587.41,17.92,9.76" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. ELiRF-UPV, associated with the Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the informatics School of Universitat Politècnica de València, participated in the eRisk 2023 Task 2. Their approach centered around utilizing SVMs, a traditional machine learning technique. The ELiRF-UPV team employed SVMs with different kernels and regularization parameters in their experiments. They utilized cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the SVM classifiers. To represent the text data, they employed a TF-IDF vectorizer with a maximum limit of 5,000 features. Notably, the ELiRF-UPV team achieved the highest scores in Precision, F1 score, ERDE5, ERDE50, and latency-weighted F1 in the eRisk 2023 Task 2. Formula-ML <ref type="bibr" coords="22,154.40,115.00,17.87,9.76" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The Formula-ML team participated in Task 1. To represent the sentences, Formula-ML utilized various techniques such as word2vec, the TF-IDF model, and sentence transformers. These techniques allowed them to convert the text data into numerical representations or embeddings. To determine the degree of correlation between the sentences and the answers from the BDI questionnaire, Formula-ML utilized a soft cosine similarity measure. This measure assessed the relatedness of the topics discussed in the sentences to the symptoms of depression. The results obtained by Formula-ML varied depending on the embedding model used. The models based on SentenceTransformers achieved great performance and even ranked highly in some evaluation metrics. However, the word2vec-based models did not reach the same level of performance.</p><p>Mason-NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="22,148.73,250.49,17.67,9.76" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The Mason-NLP team from George Mason University participated in Task 1 of the CLEF eRisk lab. Their approach incorporated two deep learning models, MentalBERT and RoBERTa, along with LSTM. The team employed several steps to reduce the number of sentences before passing them through the MentalBERT model, which computed an embedding representation for each sentence. The ranking of each symptom was then determined by calculating the cosine similarity between the embedding representation of each sentence and the embedding representation of the symptom options. However, the evaluation results of their approach did not meet the expectations of the authors. Despite this outcome, they acknowledged the opportunity for improvement and proposed several avenues for future work. One suggestion was to fine-tune MentalBERT using BDI training data, which could potentially enhance the model's performance.</p><p>NailP <ref type="bibr" coords="22,121.07,399.54,17.99,9.76" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The NailP team participated in Task 1. Their approach focused on data preprocessing and calculating similarity between text representations. Initially, the authors performed data pre-processing by selecting publications that contained self-referential content, specifically highlighting personal pronouns. They then filtered out positive or neutral sentences, focusing only on those with potentially negative sentiment. Sentence embeddings were calculated using SBERT (Sentence-BERT), a model that generates contextualized sentence embeddings. Additionally, the team obtained embeddings from the descriptions of the BDI-II items using the same SBERT model. To rank the sentences, a semantic search was conducted with different filters to include or exclude negative posts. NLP-UNED-2 <ref type="bibr" coords="22,159.43,521.48,18.00,9.76" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The NLP-UNED-2, from the Spanish National University of Distance Education, participated in Task 2 of the eRisk 2023 challenge. Their approach consisted of dataset relabeling using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) on vectorial representations of messages. ANN is a technique that finds approximate matches for a given query in a highdimensional space. By utilizing ANN, the team aimed to improve the labeling of the dataset. For classification, the UNED team employed neural networks. These neural networks were used to classify and identify instances of pathological gambling within the social media data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OBSER-MENH [21].</head><p>The OBSER-MENH team participated in both Task 1 and Task 2 of the eRisk challenge. For Task 1, their approach involved using SBERT to compute vector representations of each publication. They then utilized the descriptions of the BDI-II as queries to rank depressive symptoms. By leveraging SBERT and the BDI-II descriptions, they aimed to assess the relevance of each symptom in the publications. In Task 2, the OBSER-MENH team focused on addressing class imbalance and preventing overfitting. They employed an ensemble approach that combined variants of three models. The ensemble aimed to analyze the different penalty weights applied to a feedforward neural network (FNN). This approach allowed them to train multiple models with varying penalty weights, helping to find an optimal balance and prevent overfitting. RELAI <ref type="bibr" coords="23,124.91,155.65,17.84,9.76" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The RELAI team, a collaboration between universities in Quebec and McMaster, participated in both Task 1 and Task 2. For Task 1, the team utilized transformer-based sentence encoders and employed the Okapi BM25 method to select sentences. The selected sentences were then subjected to a similarity task, and the similarity scores were used for ranking, with different strategies employed. While their results did not yield significant improvements, they did outperform their chosen simple baseline in some cases. In Task 2, the RELAI team employed "lightweight" approaches. One approach involved extracting stylometric and shallow features, such as character and n-gram frequencies and sentence length. These features were then fed into a multilayer perceptron for classification. Another approach utilized topic modeling of the posts, with the resulting topics used as input to a multilayer perceptron. The final approach took a probabilistic approach, estimating the proportion of positive users from past editions to determine the gamma distribution from which they emerge.</p><p>RiskBusters <ref type="bibr" coords="23,150.98,318.24,17.73,9.76" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The RiskBuster team from the University of Bucharest participated in Task 3. Their approach involved the use of a transformer-based topic modeling method to measure the severity of eating disorder symptoms. The team customized the BERTopic framework to obtain topic distributions at the user level. These topic distributions were then utilized as input features for downstream classification tasks. By leveraging topic modeling, the team aimed to capture the underlying themes and severity of eating disorder symptoms within the social media writings. To improve the quality of embeddings, the RiskBuster team adapted MentalBERT, a transformer-based language model, to the eating disorder domain. SINAI <ref type="bibr" coords="23,120.22,426.63,17.65,9.76" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The SINAI team, a collaboration between Jaén and Bocconi universities, participated Task 2. They developed various approaches using XLM-RoBERTa and RoBERTa transformer models, with their most innovative proposal combining LSTM and RoBERTa architectures. Their approach involved encoding each user's post using RoBERTa to obtain embeddings, which were then passed through an LSTM. The final prediction was made using a Feed Forward Network.</p><p>The team also designed pre-processing steps for the corpus before training. With this approach, they achieved the highest Recall score among all participants for the binary task and had the second-highest ERDE value. In terms of ranking-based evaluation, they achieved one of the highest positions. UMU <ref type="bibr" coords="23,117.39,548.58,17.68,9.76" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The UMU team introduced different strategies to address the three distinct tasks in the eRisk 2023 challenge. For Task 1, the team approached it as a question-answering problem and presented two proposals: one for monolingual text and another for multilingual text. They employed a pre-trained sentence transformer model to assess the severity of each depressive symptom within users' text collections. The team used a depression-domain lexicon approach to select texts closely related to depression and ranked the 21 depression symptoms of the BDI questionnaire. By treating Task 1 as a question-answering task, they linked the questions of the BDI questionnaire to their possible answers in users' writings. This approach allowed them to determine the degree of relationship between each text and the 21 symptoms of depression. For Task 2, which focused on the early detection of signs of pathological gambling, UMU team presented five runs that combined decision-making strategies with classification models. In Task 3, UMU team presented a run based on fine-tuning a pre-trained sentence transformer model. They processed the dataset and performed emoji feature extraction to enhance the model's performance. UNSL <ref type="bibr" coords="24,120.58,142.10,18.00,9.76" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The UNSL (Universidad Nacional de San Luis) team participated in both Task 1 and Task 2. For Task 1, they submitted three proposals. The first two proposals focused on the similarity of contextualized embedding vectors between the posts and the symptoms of the Beck Depression Inventory. The third proposal utilized a prompting strategy, reformulating the sentence retrieval task into a masked language problem. They used ChatGPT to generate synthetic examples related to a specific symptom, and a RoBERTa model was fine-tuned to solve the masking language problem. The prompting-based strategy yielded better results than the similarity-based proposals, providing promising outcomes for information retrieval. For Task 2, related to the early detection of signs of pathological gambling, the UNSL team proposed three fine-tuned models, followed by a decision policy based on criteria defined by an early detection framework. One of the models incorporated an extended vocabulary with important words specific to the domain. The UNSL models demonstrated good performances in decision-based metrics, ranking-based metrics, and runtime for Task 2. uOttawa <ref type="bibr" coords="24,133.36,318.24,17.72,9.76" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The uOttawa team, representing the University of Ottawa, participated in Task 1. They employed a combination of word embedding models, including GloVe, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). Among the models submitted by the uOttawa team, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) consistently performed the best for every metric, whether using majority voting or unanimity for the qrels. The methods based on contextual representations, including USE, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, outperformed the methods based on GloVe embeddings. After empirical analysis, the team hypothesized that the better performance of contextual-based methods could be attributed to the removal of pronouns, which may contain relevant information in the discourse. This removal was not applied to the methods based on GloVe embeddings.</p><p>Xabi_EHU <ref type="bibr" coords="24,142.45,453.73,17.67,9.76" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The Xabi_EHU team, representing the University of the Basque Country (UP-V/EHU), participated in Task 2. To address the issue of class imbalance, where the Pathological Gamblers group is smaller than the Control group, the team employed a neural network with a customized loss function. This approach allowed them to adjust penalties for false positives and false negatives, providing flexibility to meet specific requirements. By utilizing this customized loss function, their training approach did not penalize false positives and negatives equally.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper provides an overview of eRisk 2023, which marked the seventh edition of the lab. The lab focused on three distinct tasks: symptoms search (Task 1 on depression), early detection (Task 2 on pathological gambling), and severity estimations (Task 3 on eating disorders). In Task 1, participants were presented with a collection of sentences and tasked with ranking them based on their relevance to each symptom of depression outlined in the BDI-II questionnaire. Task 2 required participants to sequentially analyze social media posts and issue alerts for individuals displaying signs of gambling risk. In Task 3, participants were provided with the complete user history and required to automatically estimate the user's responses to a standardized depression questionnaire. A total of 105 runs were submitted by 20 teams for the proposed tasks. While the effectiveness of the solutions varies across tasks, the experimental results highlight the value of extracting evidence from social media. This suggests the promising potential of automatic or semiautomatic screening tools for detecting at-risk individuals. These findings emphasize the necessity for the development of benchmarks for text-based risk indicator screening.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,260.28,281.18,9.96"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of TREC format for a participant's run for Task 1.</figDesc></figure>

Regarding 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 and 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 SINAI (runs 0 and 2) are the ones that having perfect values obtained the best 𝐹 1. The majority of teams made quick decisions.
