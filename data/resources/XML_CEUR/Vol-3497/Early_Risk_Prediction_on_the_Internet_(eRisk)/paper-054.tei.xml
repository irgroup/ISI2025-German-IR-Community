<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Depression is a global health concern with severe consequences for individuals, making its recognition and understanding crucial. Recently, there has been a growing interest in utilizing social media platforms as valuable sources of information to gain insights into individuals' experiences with depression. Analyzing textual data from diverse user populations enables the identification of common symptoms, triggers, coping mechanisms, and potential warning signs. Researchers have developed algorithms and machine learning models to automate the detection of depressive symptoms in text, facilitating more efficient screening and early intervention. This paper describes the participation of team NailP in the CLEF eRisk 2023 task 1, which focuses on ranking sentences from user writings based on their relevance to symptoms of depression. The goal is to evaluate the sentences and determine their level of relevance to each symptom outlined in the Beck Depression Questionnaire-II.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, in 2015, approximately 4.4% of the global population was affected by depression (i.e., around 322 million people) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,414.10,498.73,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Over the period from 2005 to 2015, there was an 18.4% increase in the total number of individuals living with depression. This growth reflects the overall expansion of the global population, as well as a proportional rise in the age groups where depression is more prevalent. According to the World Health Organization, these statistics emphasize the substantial global impact of depression and underline the importance of addressing and understanding this prevalent mental health condition.</p><p>Depression is a serious health condition that may lead to severe consequences on individuals. It can cause significant suffering and impair their ability to perform effectively in various domains such as work, school, and family life <ref type="bibr" coords="2,292.46,168.26,11.36,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In its most severe form, depression can even result in suicidal thoughts and actions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,259.42,181.81,11.32,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Therefore, recognizing and addressing depression is crucial for promoting mental well-being and preventing tragic outcomes.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a significant number of studies dedicated to exploring the data related to depression on various social media platforms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,340.73,222.46,11.52,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Researchers have recognized the potential of these platforms as valuable sources of information that can shed light on individuals' experiences with depression. An increasing number of studies have focused on analyzing textual data, such as posts, comments, and messages, shared by users discussing their thoughts, feelings, and struggles related to depression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.18,276.66,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.26,276.66,7.57,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Analyzing a wide range of textual data from diverse user populations enables researchers to identify common symptoms, triggers, coping mechanisms, and even identify potential warning signs for early intervention. By developing algorithms and machine learning models, these studies aim to automate the detection of depressive symptoms in text, enabling more efficient screening and early intervention. Such research contributes to the development of innovative tools and techniques that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of depression in several languages. For example, since 2014 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC <ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.81,385.05,12.23,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) has been used for depression detection, as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,391.21,385.05,11.57,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Since LIWC has been developed for multiple languages <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.99,398.60,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, it can be adapted in a similar manner across different languages to detect manifestations of depression. This advancement in linguistic analysis tools, such as LIWC, and their extensive language coverage offer researchers valuable resources to investigate the expression of depression within diverse cultural and linguistic contexts.</p><p>Early intervention, combined with the use of early detection technologies, plays a key role in effectively addressing the challenges posed by depression. The use of early detection technologies finds significant applications across various domains, with particular relevance to areas encompassing health and safety. Notably, the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) has played a significant role since 2010 by establishing tasks focused on early risk (eRisk) prediction on the internet. These initiatives have contributed to the development of effective methods and tools for identifying and predicting potential risks and dangers in online environments</p><p>In this paper, we describe the participation of our team, NailP, in the Task 1 of CLEF eRisk 2023 <ref type="foot" coords="2,109.18,572.98,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The goal of this task is to rank sentences from a collection of user writings based on their relevance to symptoms of depression. Participants are tasked with providing rankings for the 21 symptoms of depression as outlined in the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,615.39,16.41,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. By evaluating the sentences, the aim was to determine their level of relevance to each symptom. An overview of the competition can be found at <ref type="bibr" coords="2,352.97,628.93,16.25,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines some related work. Section 3 is dedicated to the description of the task we participated, and includes both the methodology used and the obtained results. We conclude the paper and discuss future work in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The organization of eRisk at CLEF in 2017 marked its inaugural year, representing a significant milestone in the field <ref type="bibr" coords="3,187.41,172.69,16.39,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The main purpose of eRisk was to investigate evaluation methodologies, efficacy measures, and other process issues related to early detection of risk. Early detection techniques can be used in various areas, especially health and safety. In the first edition of eRisk, a significant component was dedicated to a pilot task focused on early detection of depression risk. Participants were invited to engage in this task, which aimed to explore novel approaches and methodologies for identifying early indicators of depression utilizing diverse data sources. Since then, the task of depression detection has been consistently proposed and included in subsequent editions of eRisk. This ongoing focus on depression detection highlights the recognition of its significance as a critical area of research within the early risk detection domain.</p><p>As part of the Early Detection of Depression task at CLEF 2017, Trottek et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,440.29,308.18,17.77,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> conducted a thorough investigation of various linguistic and meta features, which encompassed items such as personal and possessive pronouns, past tense verbs, occurrences of the word 'I,' and text readability measures. The authors combined these features with n-gram features to train a logistic regression classifier. This work achieved top scores in precision, F1, and ERDE 5 .</p><p>In the following year (i.e., 2018), different authors achieved the top performance measures in the Early Detection of Depression task at CLEF. Trotzek et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.30,389.48,18.03,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> achieved the best ERDE 50 and F1 scores by establishing a threshold for the logistic regression probabilities. Funez et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,416.58,17.87,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> employed the Flexible Temporal Variation of Terms (FTVT) approach, utilizing sequential information on term variations across different post chunks, resulting in the best 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 score for the task. Paul et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.43,443.67,17.90,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> utilized an Ada Boost classifier with Bag of Words (BoW) features, leading to the highest precision score.</p><p>Since then, several other approaches have been proposed for the Early Detection of Depression task. In 2019, Cacheda et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.45,484.32,17.94,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> used data from social media networks to investigate various machine learning-based methods for early detection of Major Depressive Disorders (MDDs). Through a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, the subjects' behavior was characterized based on different aspects of their writings, including textual spreading, time gap, and time span. Two distinct approaches were proposed, namely the singleton and dual methods, both relying on machine learning techniques. The singleton approach employed a single random forest (RF) classifier with two threshold functions, while the dual approach utilized two independent RF classifiers. One classifier aimed to detect depressed subjects, while the other aimed to identify nondepressed individuals. In both cases, features were derived from textual, semantic, and writing similarities, enhancing the effectiveness of the classification process for early detection of MDDs. The results improved state-of-the-art detection models by more than 10%.</p><p>Figuerêdo et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.60,633.36,18.07,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a method for early detection of depression in social media applying a combination of a convolutional neural network, context-independent word embeddings, and Early and Late Fusion approaches. Experimental evaluations were conducted, taking into account the significance of the underlying emotions conveyed by emoticons. The findings reveal that the proposed method successfully identified potentially depressive users, achieving a precision of 0.76. Moreover, the method exhibited equivalent or superior effectiveness compared to several baseline approaches, as evidenced by an F1 score of 0.71.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="4,112.33,141.16,16.42,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors used neural language models to devise two distinct methods to detect depression symptoms by computing semantic similarities using the cosine similarity on both the sentences and descriptions of BDI-II. The first exploits users' general language based on their publications. The second seeks more direct evidence from publications that specifically mention the symptoms concerns. The authors find that approaches based on neural language models are a feasible alternative for estimating depression rating scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task 1 -Search for symptoms of depression</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Task description</head><p>The provided dataset was a collection of writings (posts) gathered from social media. The collection presents writings from 3,107 different users. In this collection, each user is the author of many writings. Also, each writing is a sequence of text sentences. There are in total 3,606,209 sentences.</p><p>The participants were also pointed to the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). This questionnaire consists of 21 multiple-choice items that assess the severity of depressive symptoms experienced by an individual. Each item describes a specific symptom or feeling related to depression, and the respondent is asked to choose the statement that best reflects their experience. The BDI items cover a wide range of depressive symptoms, including emotional, cognitive, motivational, and physical aspects. The questionnaire is typically scored by summing the responses to the individual items, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of depression. The list below presents the general theme of each BDI item. Each item above is associated to four possible answers, that are presented in increasing level of severity. When fulfilling this questionnaire, an individual should choose exactly one answer for each item. The answers are associated to integer number in such a way that a total score can be attributed to an individual, and this score is used to assess her/his corresponding level of depression.</p><p>In Task 1, participants were assigned the task of ranking sentences of the provided collection according to their relevance to the set of BDI depression symptoms. The organizers stated that, to be considered relevant to a BDI symptom, a sentence must convey information about the user's state concerning the symptom. Hence, a sentence should be considered relevant even when it indicates that the user is ok with the symptom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data preprocessing</head><p>We first performed some data preparation on the provided collection (which is given as a set of XML documents) to put it in a tabular format. During this steps, we replaced all 386,328 URL occurrences by a special marker '[URL]'. As a result, a tabular dataset of 3,606,209 entries was created. For each entry, we have fours data items: user_ID, sequence_ID, doc_ID, and text. These are the user identifier, the sentence identifier, the post identifier and the sentence content, respectively.</p><p>Based on the information that indicators of depression in textual content involve emotional content and self-reference [20], we proceeded to perform some data enrichment using the NLTK library <ref type="foot" coords="5,118.79,324.63,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Concretely, we extracted sentiment and self-reference information from each sentence. For the sentiment metadata, we identified the polarity scores for each sentence. NLTK library produces four polarity scores for each sentence given as input: positive, negative, neutral, and compound. We computed these scores for all sentences and then kept the predominant emotion for each sentence by selecting the sentiment associated to the maximum score value.</p><p>For the self-reference metadata, we tokenized each sentence to break it into individual words. We then assigned part-of-speech tags to the resulting tokens. This allowed us to enrich each sentence with a self-reference flag: if an input sentence contains at least one reference to a personal pronoun (from a predefined list), we flag it as a self-referential content. We used the following list of personal pronouns: 'myself', 'my', 'I', 'ourselves', 'me'.</p><p>In the next step, we filtered the collection of sentences, using the following procedure. We kept only sentences with self-referential content. From this subset, we applied a second filter: we discarded predominantly neutral or positive sentences; we also ignored completely nonnegative sentences. As a result of this step, the number of potentially relevant sentences was reduced drastically, going from 3,606,209 to 109,230.</p><p>Next, we built vector embeddings for the sentences that remained after applying the previous (filtering) step. To build the vector embeddings, we used the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 pretrained model" <ref type="foot" coords="5,121.01,554.96,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . This is a language model based on the MiniLM architecture. The MiniLM model is a variant of the Transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network architecture widely used for natural language processing tasks. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model has been pretrained on a large corpus of text data to learn general language representations. The model is designed to be smaller and more computationally efficient compared to larger language models. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model was trained to understand and generate text in a variety of languages and can perform tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. We used the MiniLM model to map each input sentence to a 384 dimensional dense vector. As a result, a total of 109,230 vector embeddings were created.</p><p>We also used MiniLM to encode the textual content related to the answers in each of the 21 items in the BDI questionnaire. Let 𝒜 be the set of 84 (4 × 21) answers in this questionnaire. We first used GPT3 to automatically generate semantically equivalent answers for each answer 𝑎 ∈ 𝒜. As a result, an augmented set 𝒜 + 𝑖 of answers was generated for each original answer 𝑖, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 84. These augmented sets are presented in Appendix A. We then generated vector embeddings for each element of each set 𝒜 + 𝑖 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Sentence ranking systems</head><p>In this section, to simplify mathematical notation, we use the same symbol to denote a fragment of textual content and its corresponding vector embedding. This way, we use 𝑠 to denote both a sentence written by some user, and the vector embedding computed for 𝑠. We do the same for a given answer in one of the BDI items, denoting both its textual content and vector embedding by the same symbol 𝑎.</p><p>The general approach we used in our systems (i.e, alternative solutions) to rank sentences in the provided collection according to the BDI items was the following. For each candidate sentence 𝑠, we compute a set of real numbers {𝜎 𝑠𝑑 }, which are the similarities between 𝑠 and item 𝑑 in the BDI questionnaire, 1 ≤ 𝑑 ≤ 21. For a given pair (𝑠, 𝑑), we compute 𝜎 𝑠𝑑 as the maximum value considering the similarities between 𝑠 and the corresponding answers of 𝑑, 𝒜(𝑑). We use the cosine similarity as our measure of similarity between sentences and answers. See Eq. 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,238.37,407.68,268.26,18.35">𝜎 𝑠𝑑 = max 𝑎 𝑖 ∈𝒜(𝑑) cosine(𝑠, 𝑎 𝑖 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>By using the procedure outline above, we compute the similarities between the set of candidate sentences 𝒮 and the set of BDI items. Then, to determine the set of most similar sentences to a given item 𝑑, we sort the elements 𝑠 ∈ 𝒮 by decreasing values of 𝜎 𝑠𝑑 and select the top-ranked sentences in the resulting sorted list. The number of selected sentences for a given BDI-item is controlled by a hyperparameter which we call minimum-score, a value between 0 and 1. All the sentences with similarity greater than or equal to this predefined value are selected as relevant.</p><p>We built five ranking systems using the general approach described above. These systems (aka runs) are named T1_M1, T1_M2, T1_M3, T1_M4, and T1_M5. These systems basically differ in (1) how the set 𝒜(𝑑) for each item 𝑑 was built, and (2) which sentiment polarities were considered to filter the set of candidate sentences. The particularities of each proposed ranking system are described below.</p><p>• T1_M1. When build the 𝒜(𝑑) sets, ignores predominantly positive or neutral posts (i.e., keeps "neg" posts). Minimum score value is set to 0.0. Also, considers only negative posts. • T1_M2. T1_M1. When build the 𝒜(𝑑) sets, ignores predominantly neutral posts (i.e., keeps both "neg" and "pos" posts). This system was inspired by one of the instructions provided by the organizers: A sentence will be deemed relevant to a BDI symptom when it conveys information about the user's state concerning the symptom. That is, it may be relevant even when it indicates that the user is ok with the symptom. Minimum score value is set to 0.0. • T1_M3. This approach is similar to T1-M2. Minimum score value is set to 0.4. Also, considers only negative posts. • T1_M4. This approach is similar to T1-M2. Additionally, considers equivalent ways to express the answers in each item (symptom). Minimum score value is set to 0.4. • T1_M5. This approach is similar to T1-M2. Additionally, considers equivalent ways to express the answers in each item (symptom). That is, 𝒜(𝑑) is built considering the set of equivalent answers. Minimum score value is set to 0.0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Results</head><p>Task participants had to provide a resulting file for each proposed ranking system. Each resulting file was required to have at most 1, 000 lines for each BDI item. Each line contained five columns: item_number (a value from 1 to 21 identifying the Beck's Depression Inventory item), the string "Q0" (for TREC format compliance), the sentence_id, position_in_ranking, score (we used the cosine similarity), and system_name (one of "T1_M1", "T1_M2", "T1_M3", "T1_M4", "T1_M5", identifying the ranking system corresponding to the file).</p><p>The performance results obtained by our team are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,425.66,328.09,5.17,10.91">1</ref> (majority-based qrels) and Table <ref type="table" coords="7,164.82,341.64,5.17,10.91">2</ref> (unanimity-based qrels).

Being this our first participation in these challenges, we understand there is still room to improve our methodology. Indeed, the results obtained encourage us to further contribute to this area of research. For future work, we plan to extend the methodology we used, which was completely unsupervised, with supervised techniques. Concretely, we plan to investigate how several classifier models trained on different symptoms of depression could leverage the detection of improved values of similarities. Adding more information coming from the collected metadata (such as the user-id) is also in our plans.</p><p>artmed.2022.102380.</p><p>[20] A. Nejad, P. Fossati, C.
