<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mental health problems, such as depression and pathological gambling, are conditions that can have very serious consequences if untreated, and cause the patient a lot of suffering. Research suggests that the way people write can reflect mental well-being and mental health risks, and social media provides a source of user-generated text to study. Early detection is crucial for mental health problems, and with this in mind the shared task eRisk was created. This paper describes the participation of the group OBSER-MENH on the T1 and T2 subtask at 2023. In the Task 1, participants had to provide rankings for the 21 symptoms of depression from the BDI-II Questionnaire and we used an approach based on the semantic textual similarity using Transformers. Task 2 consisted of sequentially processing pieces of evidence and detect early traces of pathological gambling as soon as possible. We implemented a penalty strategy in the loss function to deal with label imbalance. We combined three feed-forward neural networks with varying penalty values.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Mental health conditions, including depression and pathological gambling, have a significant impact on the lives of millions of individuals annually. Unfortunately, many individuals with these disorders fail to seek timely medical attention, resulting in unnecessary suffering. Some individuals are unaware of their need for treatment, while others avoid seeking help due to the associated stigma. Regardless of the reasons, untreated mental illnesses tend to worsen over time and can lead to severe consequences, such as substance abuse or even death.</p><p>Language serves as a fundamental means of communication between individuals, allowing for the transmission of intended messages while also conveying information about various aspects of oneself, such as upbringing, mood, and emotional well-being. Numerous studies have revealed a correlation between differences in language usage and writing style and the presence of mental health conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.23,247.89,11.33,9.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.28,247.89,7.55,9.74" target="#b1">2]</ref>. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, researchers can explore the application of language analysis to identify untreated mental health problems.</p><p>Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit provide an extensive collection of usergenerated texts, where individuals interact with friends, follow discussion groups, and express their thoughts and emotions. These platforms offer a vast amount of information that can be leveraged for NLP-based techniques with various purposes. Recent research has employed such techniques to automatically detect users who may be experiencing various mental health issues.</p><p>In the context of mental health, early intervention is particularly crucial as it enhances the likelihood of positive treatment outcomes. The longer a patient suffers without medical intervention, the higher the chances of experiencing associated risks. Early detection aids in identifying such cases before they escalate into more significant problems. While existing literature primarily focuses on detecting individuals who already have established mental health conditions, we contend that emphasizing early detection is vital for enabling prompt diagnosis and intervention.</p><p>To address this objective, the eRisk shared task was established. This shared task concentrates on the early detection of mental health problems within social networks. Previous editions of this initiative have targeted issues such as anorexia, self-harm, and pathological gambling. In the 2023 eRisk shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,224.43,491.78,11.58,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, three subtasks were proposed, and this paper outlines our participation in subtasks T1 (Search for symptoms of depression) and T2 (Early Detection of Signs of Pathological Gambling).</p><p>The following sections are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the participation of our team in the task 1; Section 3 details our work for the participation in the task 2; Finally, Section 4 presents our conclusions and ideas for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task 1: Search for symptoms of depression</head><p>The objective of this task entails the arrangement of sentences extracted from a corpus of usergenerated texts, based on their pertinence to a specific manifestation of depression. Participants will be requested to assign rankings to the 21 symptoms of depression as outlined in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" coords="2,293.70,658.80,11.53,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. A sentence will be considered relevant to a particular symptom if it contains information pertaining to the user's condition with respect to that symptom. In other words, a sentence may be deemed relevant even if it indicates that the user is experiencing no difficulties associated with the symptom in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Related Work</head><p>eRisk, under the umbrella of the international Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF), is one of the most important initiatives towards early detection of mental health-related problems on the Internet. These evaluation campaigns provide a suitable environment for the automatic identification of early risks, the publication of corpora and collections, and the development of evaluation methodologies and metrics. In 2017 was proposed an initial pilot program <ref type="bibr" coords="3,129.37,232.66,12.68,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> devoted to predicting depression, aiming to determine as soon as possible, whether an individual exhibits traces of depression through the analysis of posts in social media. In particular, the open-source platform Reddit was selected for building the collection of posts used in this task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,141.99,273.31,11.59,9.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The task was also proposed in the 2018 and 2022 editions of eRisk. Different features have been considered for the detection of signs of depression in this task: emotion and sentiment words <ref type="bibr" coords="3,164.16,300.41,11.28,9.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, readability features <ref type="bibr" coords="3,267.81,300.41,11.28,9.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, words from depression-based lexicon or ontologies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,313.96,11.58,9.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, linguistic metadata <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.94,313.96,16.56,9.74" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,217.61,313.96,14.11,9.74" target="#b10">11]</ref> or information on the writing style <ref type="bibr" coords="3,398.71,313.96,16.42,9.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, as well as features widely employed in NLP such as word embeddings or linguistic information like Part-of-Speech tagging. Deep learning models based on neural networks (Long-Short Term Memory or LSTMs and Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs) have achieved the best results in this task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,477.50,354.60,11.23,9.74" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,491.36,354.60,12.23,9.74" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In the 2022 edition, many proposals were based on transformers, or combinations of these with other technologies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,174.76,381.70,16.25,9.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The current edition differs from previous editions in that the focus is now on ranking of sentences from each user's writings according to their relevance with respect to a symptom of depression. We have resorted to the application of semantic similarity techniques to address it. The methods used for the calculation of semantic similarity include vector-based representations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,449.45,16.39,9.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, graph-based models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.97,449.45,18.06,9.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and transformer-based models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,367.23,449.45,16.39,9.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this work we have preferred the transformer-based methods that currently provide the best results. These models use attention to capture interactions between words and generate high quality contextual representations. Similarity between texts can be computed using distance or cosine similarity between corresponding transformer representations. Specifically, we have used BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,287.86,517.19,16.09,9.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a language model that is known for its ability to capture the context and relationships between words. It uses a transformer architecture that applies multiple layers of attention and representational computations to process both the information before and after a given word. This allows BERT to capture the meaning and dependency of words in a broader context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Dataset Description</head><p>The organizers provide to the participants a TREC formatted sentence-tagged dataset together with the BDI-II questionnaire.</p><p>The dataset is composed of a set of 3107 documents and each of these documents is composed of sentences. Below is an excerpt from document s_949.trec:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,128.02,89.33,168.46,35.24">&lt; D O C &gt; &lt; D O C N O &gt; s _ 9 4 9 _ 1 4 0 9 _ 1 &lt; / D O C N O &gt; &lt; T</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Proposed Model</head><p>In order to calculate the similarity between the sentences and the 21 symptoms, we first transformed each piece of text into an embedding and then we calculated the cosine distance between the embeddings of each pair of pieces of text. The sentences are mapped such that symptoms with similar meanings are close in the vector space. For this, we use the Sentence Transformers (ST) framework <ref type="bibr" coords="4,229.18,232.66,18.08,9.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> which employs a pre-trained BERT model to obtain the contextual representation of the sentences and symptoms and applies a mean pooling method to the output in such a way that it converts the embeddings of tokens to embeddings of sentences of a fixed size. This mean pooling technique, used by default in ST, is done by averaging the output embeddings.</p><p>We have used several models derived from BERT to obtain the embeddings that represent both the sentences and the text of every symptom in the questionnaire. BERT (and other transformer networks) output for each token in our input text an embedding. In order to create a fixed-sized sentence embedding out of this, the model applies mean pooling, i.e., the output embeddings for all tokens are averaged to yield a fixed-sized vector.</p><p>The models used in the different runs are as follows:</p><p>• all-mpnet-base-v2<ref type="foot" coords="4,198.48,387.99,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_0">1</ref> : This model maps sentences and paragraphs to a 768 dimensional dense vector space. • all-distilroberta-v1<ref type="foot" coords="4,201.18,416.44,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_1">2</ref> : This model is pretrained from distilroberta-base model and finetuned on a 1B sentence pairs dataset. • all-MiniLM-L12-v2<ref type="foot" coords="4,202.34,444.90,4.06,7.79" target="#foot_2">3</ref> : This model is pretrained from the microsoft/MiniLM-L12-H384uncased model and fine-tuned on a 1B sentence pairs dataset.</p><p>For models "all-mpnet-base-v2" and "all-distilroberta-v1", two different runs were performed depending on the number of terms used to calculate the semantic similarity. Various sizes were used in the preliminary experiments and finally results were submitted for the first 90 and 20 terms respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Results</head><p>In this section we analyze the task results of our participation. Once the runs from the participating teams have been submitted, organizers created the relevance judgements with the help of human assessors using pooling. They have used the resulting qrels to evaluate the systems with classical ranking metrics.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,127.19,88.09,5.11,9.74">1</ref> shows the ranking-based evaluation for Task 1 using the majority voting approach. Based on the results obtained, the model with the best performance is "all-distilroberta-v1". In addition, across the different models, the use of the first 90 terms performed better than the use of 20.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task 2: Early Detection of Signs of Pathological Gambling</head><p>The aim of this task is to identify signs of pathological gambling as earlier as possible <ref type="bibr" coords="5,465.11,588.00,11.28,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. With that aim, participants are given a set of social media posts that have to be processed in the order they were written. The sooner a pathological gambler is detected by the system, the better. The task is also addressed as a ranking decision problem, rather than assigning labels 0 (non pathological gambler) or 1 (pathological gambler), a score of the estimation of the risk to suffer such a disorder is computed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Related Work</head><p>Early detection of signs of pathological gambling is crucial to increase the effectiveness of psychological therapies and be able to help patients at an early stage of the disease. When this assignment was first introduced in 2021, eRisk did not offer labeled data <ref type="bibr" coords="6,461.52,135.76,16.09,9.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Both last and this year the task has been carried out with provided labeled training data <ref type="bibr" coords="6,458.96,149.31,16.25,9.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the methods employed to address this task, in 2021 UNSL team, the team attaining the best results, analyzed three different early alert policies based on standard classification models, rule-based algorithms and deep learning models. In this case, the best result was achieved with an SVM <ref type="bibr" coords="6,150.81,203.50,16.39,9.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. On the same year, UPV-Symanto team made use of BERT transformers in order to detect pathological gamblers <ref type="bibr" coords="6,258.00,217.05,16.25,9.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Last year, with training data made available, UNSL team proposed a variant of the previous year incorporating two score normalization steps reducing the runtime and improving the model performance <ref type="bibr" coords="6,180.67,257.70,16.42,9.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The BLUE <ref type="bibr" coords="6,254.10,257.70,18.07,9.74" target="#b23">[24]</ref> team, who achieved similar results, trained a BERT classifier with additional training data. The team that achieved the best F-score was NLP-UNED <ref type="bibr" coords="6,89.29,284.80,17.76,9.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref> with a 0.868 F1. They used an Approximate Nearest Neighbour approach in order to assign post level labels.</p><p>There was, as well, an approach based on FFNN, by the SINAI group <ref type="bibr" coords="6,397.20,311.90,16.09,9.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, attaining an F-score of 0.8. They fed the FFNN with vectors that encapsulated emotions, semantic information, lexical diversity and volumetry of the posts. For what us regards we found that this approach was comprehensive and opted to explore it to get base-learners in order to build an ensemble model.</p></div>

Pathological gamblers do not exceed 6% and 5% in training and test sub-sets respectively.</p><p>The texts were pre-processed, as follows: first the title and posts were concatenated, next, stop-words were removed.</p><p>In order to obtain a numeric representation of the posts, we employed the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,158.69,670.00,16.41,9.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This encoder, on it's Dynamic Aggregation of Network (DAN) variant, generates an embedding of dimension 512 as the output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Proposed Model</head><p>Our approach focuses on tackling skewed class-distribution and also prevent over-fitting and entails an ensemble combining variants of a base-model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Base models</head><p>Our approach consists of a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) implemented using Python torch library <ref type="bibr" coords="7,181.88,240.16,17.80,9.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref> fed by the posts represented by USE <ref type="bibr" coords="7,363.26,240.16,17.80,9.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref> encoder. Softmax activation function is employed to predict the class at post level. With respect to the practical details, we paid attention to over-fitting and tried to prevent it in two ways. On the one hand, AdamW optimizer was selected in the training process; on the other hand, 0.1 dropout was set.</p><p>The class distribution is clearly imbalanced, with 'Control' being the majority label (nearly 20 times more frequent than the target 'Pathological gamblers'), as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,479.70,307.90,3.81,9.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. As a consequence the network can become skewed, and consequently obtain low accuracy in the minority class. To address the class imbalance, we have applied a loss function based on cross-entropy also implemented in torch library.</p><p>During training, when labels are assigned at post level, first, the loss is calculated using cross entropy loss between the predicted post level labels (denoted as 𝑦 ′ 𝑘 ) and ground truth labels (denoted as 𝑦 𝑘 ). Additionally, a user-level label is estimated from the estimated post-level labels. If any of the post level predicted labels, (𝑦 ′ 𝑘1 , … , 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 ), is positive (being 𝑛 the amount of posts for user k), the user is considered positive (𝑌 ′ 𝑘 = 1), as in expression <ref type="bibr" coords="7,389.62,416.30,10.47,9.74" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. This user-level label is then compared with the user's ground truth label to train the model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="7,196.68,451.14,309.30,26.02">𝑌 ′ 𝑘 = { 1, if ∃ i in 1 &lt;= 𝑖 &lt;= 𝑛 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑖 &gt; 0.5 0, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒<label>(1)</label></formula><p>As an additional measure in order to address over-fitting, we implemented a penalty at user-level. That is, when a user is positive but was predicted as negative, the cross entropy loss is penalized by a scalar. The higher the penalty, the more will the loss be penalized. Our base penalty function is presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,258.42,525.33,10.51,9.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. We consider all post level predictions of a user 𝑘 as the vector ⃗ 𝑦 ′ 𝑘 = (𝑦 ′ 𝑘1 , … , 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 ) and ground truth post level labels as vector ⃗ 𝑦 𝑘 = (𝑦 𝑘1 , … , 𝑦 𝑘𝑛 ), 𝑤 is the penalty weight. The penalization is applied whenever a user label is predicted incorrectly</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="7,88.96,564.81,417.02,57.27">(𝑌 ′ 𝑘 ≠ 𝑌 𝑘 ) 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = { 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 ( ⃗ 𝑦 ′ 𝑘 , ⃗ 𝑦 𝑘 ) if 𝑌 ′ 𝑘 = 𝑌 𝑘 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 ( ⃗ 𝑦 ′ 𝑘 , ⃗ 𝑦 𝑘 ) ⋅ 𝑤 otherwise<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Ensemble models</head><p>In order to analyze the impact of different penalty values to deal with label imbalance, we implemented an ensemble model. We trained three base-models varying the values of the penalty weight (𝑤 0 =5, 𝑤 1 = 3, 𝑤 2 = 2). Note that we get a post level prediction for a user post (𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 ) by each of the three base-models involved, denoted as 𝑀 𝑙 (with 0 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 2). These predictions are denoted as 𝑀0 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 , 𝑀1 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 , 𝑀2 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 respectively. Next, we built three alternative ensemble models (𝑀 𝑒 ), each, yielding its prediction (𝑀 𝑒 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 ) using the following techniques:</p><p>• Max voting: The final prediction for a post is the maximum among the base-models involved as in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,181.24,177.27,10.48,9.74" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="8,268.26,201.14,237.72,19.86">𝑀 𝑒𝑀𝑎𝑥 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 = max 𝑙 𝑀𝑙 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛<label>(3)</label></formula><p>• Average: The prediction represents the average of all models predictions, as in expression <ref type="bibr" coords="8,116.24,238.91,10.48,9.74" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="8,265.70,248.77,240.29,27.80">𝑀 𝑒𝐴𝑣𝑔 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 = 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑙 𝑀𝑙 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛<label>(4)</label></formula><p>• F-score weighted average: On this technique different weights are assigned to each model predictions based on their F-score (𝑓 𝑙 ) to promote each models contribution to the average as in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,177.43,308.03,10.48,9.74" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="8,265.12,319.63,240.86,42.87">𝑀 𝑒𝑊 𝑎𝑣 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 = ∑ 𝑙 𝑓 𝑙 ⋅ 𝑀𝑙 𝑦 ′ 𝑘𝑛 ∑ 𝑙 𝑓 𝑙<label>(5)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Results</head><p>In a preliminary experiment we tested the base-models with and without the penalty weight presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,148.65,411.67,10.52,9.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and also varying the penalty weight. Experimentally, we found that it was worth using the penalty weight and the best weighting values resulted to be 𝑤 0 =5, 𝑤 1 = 3, 𝑤 2 = 2. Next we combined the selected base learners (each with the aforementioned penalty weight) and thus built ensemble models following the three alternative combination methods explored in section 3.3.2. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,236.11,465.87,5.17,9.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the configuration used on each run. The first two rows refer to base-models while the last three rows refer to ensemble models combined the base-learners mentioned in the corresponding column.  behavior is similar. The Recall is 1 in all the runs and the precision is close to 0. This means that the model is effectively identifying the positive gamblers. Nevertheless, the low precision indicates a high number of false positives. In other words, the model predicts a user as positive in almost all cases. In table <ref type="table" coords="9,135.63,276.80,4.97,9.74">6</ref> we present the ranking based performance results. These results concern the users' level of risk estimated from the writings processed so far. As in previous results, our models show the same behaviour with a little improvement in runs 0,3 and 4 when taking into account 1000 writings. It achieves good results in P@10 and NDCG@10. However, when the ranking is calculated accross 100 sample users (NDCG@100) our results worsen.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>Our participation in the 2023 edition of eRisk has focused on two tasks. On the one hand, task 1 addressed the challenge of searching for symptoms of depression. On the other hand, task 2 dealt with the problem of early detection of signs of pathological gambling.</p><p>Regarding task 1, we tackle the issue as a semantic similarity task by leveraging transformers and employing pre-trained models to compute the similarity. Our approach has yielded a highly effective method, exhibiting optimal performance and being the second team in the ranking of best results. In the future we would like to address the problem of ambiguity in the use of certain terms that can confuse models based on semantic similarity.</p><p>Our proposed approach for task 2: early detection of signs of pathological gambling, was an ensemble between three models. The aim of the ensemble models was to analyze the different penalty weights applied on the FFNN. The implemented model was effective when predicting the risk level of the patients, obtaining proficient results in that task. Nevertheless, it wasn't able to detect users that don't have signs of pathological gambling.</p><p>Further research should be done to deal with the label imbalance and improve our method. It would be interesting to asses the effects of oversampling the minority class or to use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for artificial examples. Moreover, results suggest that to perform an ensemble on this scenario isn't beneficial, showing similar results in all cases. Therefore, a natural progression of this work is to make an ensemble of different Deep Learning methods that show differences on their individual performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2" coords="6,88.99,511.65,386.25,73.22"><head>Table 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Quantitative description of the train and test data sets.</figDesc><table coords="6,116.87,539.30,358.37,45.57"><row><cell></cell><cell>Train</cell><cell></cell><cell>Test</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell cols="4">Pathological Gamblers Control Pathological Gamblers Control</cell></row><row><cell>Num. subjects</cell><cell>245</cell><cell>4,182</cell><cell>103</cell><cell>2,071</cell></row><row><cell>Num. total posts</cell><cell>2,298,412</cell><cell></cell><cell>1,102,871</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
