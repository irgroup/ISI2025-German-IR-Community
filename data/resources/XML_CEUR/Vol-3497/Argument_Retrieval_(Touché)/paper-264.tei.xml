<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents our (team Renji Abarai) participation in Touché 2023 Task on Argument Retrieval for Controversial Questions. In our approaches submitted to the task, we investigate the influence of argument quality estimation on the overall ranking effectiveness of retrieval approaches. In particular, we train several feature-based classifiers that predict the rhetorical quality of arguments in web documents. Additionally, we use ChatGPT prompted with a few examples as a quality and stance predictor. Then, we re-rank top-10 results retrieved by ChatNoir, a BM25F-based search engine, using the predicted stance and argument quality. In total, we submit seven runs that exploit different types of quality and stance predictors. Re-ranking based on ChatGPT predictions for both, the stance and the argument quality, yields our best-performing run. Applying this re-ranking method to the official baseline outperforms all submissions to the shared task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and Background</head><p>The Touché 2023 Task on Argument Retrieval for Controversial Questions was organized with the idea in mind to develop retrieval approaches that help users find relevant opinions and arguments on socially important debated topics like "Should education be free?" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,437.67,452.51,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[1]</ref>. Specifically, the task was to rank web documents from the ClueWeb22-B dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,391.18,466.06,12.79,10.91" target="#b3">[2]</ref> for 50 search topics by relevance to the topic and argument quality and to detect the documents' stances.</p><p>Previous editions of the Touché shared tasks on argument retrieval have shown that overall retrieval effectiveness can be improved by document re-ranking based on argument quality estimation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,138.32,520.25,11.26,10.91" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,152.31,520.25,7.51,10.91" target="#b5">4]</ref>. In our submissions to the task, we thus focus on exploiting various argument quality classifiers for ranking web documents. We also consider stance prediction to ensure that documents contain arguments.</p><p>Over the last decade, the paradigms to tackle argument quality and stance prediction have shifted dramatically. Traditionally, the respective approaches were based on manually selected linguistic features, for example, bag-of-word counts for stance detection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,417.75,588.00,11.46,10.91" target="#b6">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,431.95,588.00,7.64,10.91" target="#b7">6]</ref>. With the rise of deep learning and big data, automatic feature extraction became possible, such as semantic embeddings from BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,197.98,100.52,11.44,10.91" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. Both, the manual and the automatic features, can then be used in classification models to obtain a final prediction. Recently, generative language models such as ChatGPT <ref type="foot" coords="2,130.53,125.86,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> have been exploited for various NLP tasks, including text classification.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate: (i) the effectiveness of different classifiers for argument quality prediction that are based on manually and automatically extracted features, as well as the effectiveness of prompting GPT-3.5-turbo <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.27,168.26,11.58,10.91" target="#b9">[8]</ref>, and (ii) the influence of predicting argument quality on the overall document ranking effectiveness. Our code and data are publicly available on GitHub. <ref type="foot" coords="2,138.62,193.61,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Approaches and Runs</head><p>For our runs submitted to the shared task, we re-rank top-10 results retrieved via the API of the BM25F-based search engine ChatNoir <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.26,267.54,11.58,10.91" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, using the ChatNoir-Retriever Python library<ref type="foot" coords="2,501.78,265.78,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> integrated into the PyTerrier framework <ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.93,281.08,16.41,10.91">[10]</ref>. To query ChatNoir, we pre-process the topic titles as follows: First, we remove punctuation and stopwords using a custom list of stopwords, since the standard existing lists (e.g., from NLTK <ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.39,308.18,17.11,10.91" target="#b12">[11]</ref>) contain terms that are important for argumentation (e.g., should, because, etc.). Afterwards, the query terms are lowercased and lemmatized with the Stanza NLP package <ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.50,335.28,16.25,10.91">[12]</ref>.</p><p>We submitted seven runs in total via the official task submission platform TIRA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.36,348.83,16.41,10.91" target="#b14">[13]</ref>. Our baseline approach simply uses the results returned by ChatNoir for the pre-processed queries (topic titles). The other six submissions re-rank the baseline results based on the estimated argument quality and predicted document stance. For argument quality prediction, we train feature-based and neural classifiers using handcrafted and automatically extracted features, or prompt ChatGPT as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. In Section 2.3 we describe our final submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Feature Extraction</head><p>This Section describes our document-level features which we extract manually or automatically as described in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, respectively. Then, Section 2.1.3 introduces our featurebased classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Manual Feature Extraction</head><p>We manually create a set of 32 linguistic features that can potentially serve as indicators of argument quality, as identified by existing studies. In the subsequent paragraphs, we present the implemented features, categorizing them into four distinct groups: length-based, occurrencebased, list-based, and external.</p><p>Length. The lengths of certain pieces of text can hint at their argument quality. The varying length of paragraphs, words, or the document itself can be linked to the argumentation's completeness, clarity, complexity, evidence, and coherence <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.46,114.06,16.43,10.91" target="#b15">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,371.62,114.06,12.32,10.91" target="#b16">15]</ref>.</p><p>As an initial step, we extract the length of the document by calculating the number of characters that may indicate the document's completeness. Longer documents allow for comprehensive analysis, addressing multiple perspectives, and providing ample supporting evidence, strengthening the argument <ref type="bibr" coords="3,219.76,168.26,16.42,10.91" target="#b17">[16]</ref>. Then, we split the text into paragraphs using line breaks and compute the average sentence length (in characters) within each paragraph. Examining the average sentence length within each paragraph can leverage insights into the document's structure and clarity <ref type="bibr" coords="3,186.24,208.91,16.42,10.91" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. We also calculate the average length of sentences in the whole document. Longer sentences may demonstrate higher complexity and detailed reasoning, while shorter sentences can convey information more succinctly and maintain the reader's attention. Finally, we compute the average word length in the text. Longer words may suggest technical or specialized vocabulary, indicating a more advanced level of discourse. On the other hand, shorter words may contribute to simplicity and accessibility.</p><p>Occurrences. We further count the number of occurrences of selected characters or words relative to the overall text size to asses rhetorical impact and linguistic style as possible indicators of the argument's effectiveness.</p><p>We calculate the number of stopwords drawn from the NLTK <ref type="bibr" coords="3,380.50,346.06,17.88,10.91" target="#b12">[11]</ref> stopword list, including common articles, conjunctions, and prepositions, as possible hints towards lexical choices, grammatical structure, and overall text complexity. The punctuation marks, numerics, and external links are counted to grasp the texts' linguistic style, use of rhetorical devices, and logical reasoning. For similar reasons, we extract the number of words that start with an uppercase letter and the ones that are written fully uppercase, as well as sentences starting with an uppercase letter to check for a more formal style of writing. Connected to that, we include the average number of sentence types for a question, exclamation, and statements.</p><p>Word lists. We furthermore determine features based on selected word lists to assess the argument's sophistication, professionalism, and appropriateness. In particular, we use the academic word list <ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.70,496.76,17.75,10.91" target="#b19">[18]</ref> and profanity words <ref type="bibr" coords="3,296.55,496.76,17.76,10.91" target="#b20">[19]</ref> to estimate the levels of formality, precision, and adherence to scholarly discourse. We extract keywords from the original question and count their appearances in the respective arguments to examine the accordance between the question and argument. Also, we check for vocabulary richness with and without stopwords by determining the ratio of different words per text. Finally, we compile a list of argumentative words using ChatGPT-3.5 and manual modification based on our own experience.</p><p>External. Subsequently, we extend our feature set by incorporating external sources with additional features of higher complexity. We use the neural argument mining framework TARGER <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.16,620.37,17.83,10.91" target="#b21">[20]</ref>  <ref type="foot" coords="3,148.99,618.61,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> to extract the number of arguments (number of tokens tagged as a claim or a premise) from the given texts and the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the rule-based model Vader <ref type="bibr" coords="3,117.27,647.47,17.83,10.91" target="#b22">[21]</ref> to assess subjectivity and sentiment to grasp affective and subjective aspects that can influence an argument's effectiveness and credibility. We include 7 readability measures and the number of spelling mistakes for similar reasons. We estimate readability using the state-of-the-art measures like Flesch <ref type="bibr" coords="4,259.39,114.06,16.41,10.91" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, Flesch-Kincaid <ref type="bibr" coords="4,353.74,114.06,16.41,10.91" target="#b24">[23]</ref>, Gunning Fog <ref type="bibr" coords="4,441.32,114.06,16.41,10.91" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, Coleman Liau <ref type="bibr" coords="4,110.47,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, Dale Chall <ref type="bibr" coords="4,180.10,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b27">[26]</ref>, Automated Readability Index <ref type="bibr" coords="4,330.43,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b28">[27]</ref>, Linsear Write <ref type="bibr" coords="4,413.80,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b29">[28]</ref>, and Spache <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.08,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b30">[29]</ref>, all implemented in the NLTK library <ref type="bibr" coords="4,251.70,141.16,16.08,10.91" target="#b12">[11]</ref>. For checking grammar and spelling mistakes, we use hunspell <ref type="bibr" coords="4,139.50,154.71,16.15,10.91" target="#b31">[30]</ref>. Incorporating the mentioned features can provide insights into an argument's accessibility, clarity, and overall quality.</p><p>One could also integrate features focusing on external knowledge bases <ref type="bibr" coords="4,434.62,181.81,16.55,10.91" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,454.60,181.81,14.11,10.91" target="#b33">32]</ref> such as ConceptNet <ref type="bibr" coords="4,144.43,195.36,16.15,10.91" target="#b34">[33]</ref>, but for this work we restrict our analysis to more language-oriented features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Automatic Feature Extraction</head><p>To automatically extract features from documents, we use an instruction-based fine-tuned embedding model INSTRUCTOR <ref type="bibr" coords="4,238.41,258.24,18.07,10.91" target="#b35">[34]</ref> that allows the creation of task-and domain-specific embeddings. The model was trained on 30 different datasets spanning a wide range of tasks (e.g., retrieval, clustering, classification, etc.) and domains (e.g., science, finance, etc.) and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the 70 diverse benchmarks, improving over the previous best results. To deal with long documents, we split them into sentences using the NLTK's sentence tokenizer, represent each sentence with the INSTRUCTOR-XL model<ref type="foot" coords="4,391.72,324.23,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref> from Hugging Face <ref type="bibr" coords="4,486.90,325.98,16.23,10.91" target="#b36">[35]</ref>, and calculate the mean of the values across each feature of the sentence embeddings array. Each sentence is passed to the model using the following format: &lt;Instruction&gt;: &lt;Input&gt; with the instruction text "Represent a sentence for argumentation quality classification".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Classifiers for Argument Quality</head><p>To train classifiers that predict the argument quality of documents, we use manual labels from the Touché 2021 Task 1 ('low / no arguments', 'medium', and 'high' quality) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,416.72,429.51,12.68,10.91" target="#b4">[3]</ref> and split the data into the train (3,000 samples) and validation (700 samples) sets. To account for the discrepancy between the task topics in 2021 (used for training classifiers) and 2023 (used for the actual prediction), we ensure that all the manually judged documents retrieved for one topic are in the same split. By doing so, we tackle the so-called cross-topic argument quality prediction. For both feature types, manually and automatically extracted, we use the same 6 classification models: feedforward neural network (FNN) with 3 hidden layers, LightGBM <ref type="bibr" coords="4,398.97,510.80,16.41,10.91" target="#b37">[36]</ref>, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, SVM, and random forests. The classifiers' hyperparameters <ref type="foot" coords="4,408.12,522.60,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> are optimized with a grid search in a five-fold cross-validation on the train set.</p><p>The classifiers predict both, the class labels of argument quality and the probabilities of each class, on the validation set. We further train a metalearner classifier on the predictions of individual classifiers on our validation set. By testing different models and feature sets, the most effective metalearner is based on random forests with feature vectors combining class predictions and probabilities from all the 6 classification models trained on manual features and embeddings (i.e., 12 classifiers in total). The metalearner's hyperparameters are optimized with a grid search in a five-fold cross-validation on the validation set.</p><p>In Section 2.3, we provide a detailed description of how we use the argument quality predictions to re-rank the top-10 initially retrieved documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Prompting ChatGPT</head><p>Using few-shot prompting, we predict the argument quality of a given document with ChatGPT 7 . Our prompt consists of a brief instruction as well as 3 examples per label (i.e., 9 examples in total). We do not include queries in the prompt, as we assume argument quality to be independent of the query. The instruction gives a description of argument quality, which is taken from the shared task website. 8 Partially we slightly modified some examples (taken from our train set; see Section 2.1.3) to make them clearer or shorter. The examples are presented as a message history, i.e., the input to ChatGPT looks as if it provided the previous correct quality labels. Following the annotation guidelines, we ask ChatGPT to predict the quality as 'high', 'medium', or 'low'. 9</p><p>Sampling. Since the ChatGPT API from OpenAI only returns the generated text, but not the corresponding logits, we cannot use the logits to infer the class probabilities. To alleviate this issue, we predict the quality of each document 3 times and aggregate the (potentially different) predictions into one final score. The concrete aggregation depends on each specific run and is described in Section 2.3. 10   Context length. The prompt and document often exceed the maximum context length of ChatGPT. 11 Therefore, we truncate 218 out of 500 initially retrieved documents. We truncate documents such that they are at most 10,000 characters. Where possible, we truncate documents such that they end after a paragraph. We hypothesize that this makes truncated documents more natural, as they do not end in the middle of a paragraph, sentence, or even word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manual curation.</head><p>In about 16 % of the cases, ChatGPT does not return one of the desired labels, but generates a different text. Hence, we manually curate these text spans according to the following two rules: (i) If it is clear what label ChatGPT assigned, then we choose that label, (ii) otherwise we assign the label 'low'. The assigned label is clear if the generated text is a label as well as additional text (usually an explanation of the label). 12   Stance prediction. Similar to argument quality prediction, we use ChatGPT to predict the stance of documents given a query (the query is now included in the prompt). Here, the possible labels for ChatGPT are 'pro', 'con', 'neutral', and 'none' (i.e., a text does not take any stance because it, for instance, contains only facts but not arguments). We provide one instance as an example per label. Due to the lack of examples for 'neutral' and 'none' in our train set, we write a 'neutral' example ourselves and take the first paragraphs from a Wikipedia article (that contain some definitions, but no arguments) as 'none'. <ref type="foot" coords="6,358.95,139.41,7.41,7.97" target="#foot_6">13</ref> We again manually curate the predictions, where we assign the 'none' label if no clear label was predicted.</p><p>For stance, we again collect from ChatGPT 3 predictions per document. To aggregate the stance label we (i) take the majority label. If there is no majority we (ii) assign 'none' if 'none' was predicted once, and (iii) 'neutral' otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Submission Description</head><p>For all our submissions, we first retrieve 10 documents per query with ChatNoir using lemmatization and custom stopwords removal (see Section 2). Then, we re-rank these documents by different criteria, which are described below for each run. If our re-ranking strategy results in a tie, then documents are ranked by the relevance score obtained from the initial retrieval with ChatNoir. All submissions use the stance predicted by ChatGPT (see Section 2.2).</p><p>Run baseline: simply uses the ChatNoir results when queried with the topic titles after removing customized stopwords and lemmatization.</p><p>Run meta_qual_score: top-10 initially retrieved documents are re-ranked based on the predicted numerical quality labels using a metalearner (sorted by the quality labels in descending order).</p><p>Run meta_qual_prob: analogous to meta_qual_score but the documents with the same quality label are sorted by the class probability of the metalearner.</p><p>Run ChatGPT_mmEQhl: documents are re-ranked based on the quality predictions from ChatGPT. To aggregate the predictions from the 3 samples, we convert the discrete labels to scalars: 0, 1, and 2 for 'low', 'medium', and 'high' quality, respectively. Then, we take the average over all 3 predictions.</p><p>Run ChatGPT_mmGhl: analogous to ChatGPT_mmEQhl, except that the 'medium' quality prediction has a weight of 1.1. This means that documents where 'medium' is predicted twice are ranked higher than documents where 'low' and 'high' quality is predicted once (assuming that the third prediction is the same in both cases).</p><p>Run stance_ChatGPT : analogous to ChatGPT_mmEQhl but we additionally consider the stance prediction. Documents with stance 'none' include by definition no arguments and are therefore of low argument quality. Thus, we first (i) place the stance 'none' documents at the bottom of the ranking, and then, (ii) rank the remaining documents based on the predicted argument quality.</p><p>Run stance-certainNO_ChatGPT : analogous to stance_ChatGPT, except that documents are only considered to have no stance if that is predicted by the majority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluation Results</head><p>Following the shared task setting, 14 we evaluate our approaches for the rhetorical argument quality and the general topic relevance, both measured with nDCG@10 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,414.46,124.83,16.41,10.91" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. We also report the macro-averaged F1 scores for our stance prediction (four stance classes). Additionally, we evaluate the stance prediction in a binary fashion, where one class is 'none' (i.e., a document does not take any stance) and the other class is any stance (i.e., 'pro', 'con' or 'neutral'). We report this value since our runs stance_ChatGPT and stance-certainNO_ChatGPT depend on the quality of binary stance prediction.</p><p>None of our initially submitted runs to the task outperforms the official task baseline in terms of relevance and argument quality (see the lower part (Ours) and the middle part (BL) of Table <ref type="table" coords="7,497.16,219.67,3.50,10.91">1</ref>). The task's official retrieval baseline uses the results that the search engine ChatNoir <ref type="bibr" coords="7,453.24,233.22,12.68,10.91" target="#b10">[9]</ref> returned for the topics' titles used as queries without any pre-processing, i.e., it is an argumentationagnostic BM25F-based retrieval system. The worse effectiveness of our runs is likely due to the poor performance of our initial retrieval (run 'baseline' in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,389.92,273.87,3.79,10.91">1</ref>; details on the run are in Section 2.3) that was used in the re-ranking step.</p><p>First, we analyze our initial submissions to the task in Section 3.1. Then, Section 3.2 describes the results when applying our most promising re-ranking strategies to the official task baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Evaluation of the Submitted Runs</head><p>Our most effective initial submission ('stance_ChatGPT' run) exploits ChatGPT to predict the argument quality and stance. Then, a two-step re-ranking strategy is applied to our 'baseline' run: (i) move the 'no stance' documents to the bottom of the ranked list and then (ii) rerank the remaining documents based on the predicted argument quality in descending order. Overall, while almost all of our re-ranking strategies improve over our baseline run, statistically significant improvements are achieved only by two ChatGPT-based re-ranking approaches and only quality-wise (see Table <ref type="table" coords="7,216.50,445.54,3.57,10.91">1</ref>).</p><p>As for the stance prediction, our submitted results achieved a macro-averaged F1 of 0.599, which outperforms the official task baseline stance detector (Flan-T5 model <ref type="bibr" coords="7,431.20,472.64,18.02,10.91" target="#b39">[38]</ref> in zero-shot settings). Note that these values should not be directly compared as they are evaluated on different retrieved documents. However, when applying our stance classifier on the documents retrieved by the task baseline, we achieve a macro F1 of 0.556, which is more than twice the official task baseline effectiveness.</p><p>For our stance-based re-ranking techniques, we only consider whether (i) the document contains arguments (i.e, classes 'pro', 'con', and 'neutral') or whether (ii) the document does not contain any arguments (i.e., class 'none'). Thus, we also calculate the macro F1 scores in a binary classification fashion. We observe that ChatGPT consistently achieves scores higher than 0.75, which may explain the high effectiveness of re-ranking approaches using the predicted stance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Evaluation results of our submissions to the task (Ours), the official task baseline (BL), and our ChatGPTbased re-ranking approaches applied to the official task baseline (Ours w/ BL; experiments were conducted after the task was officially ended). The dagger † indicates a statistically significant improvement (𝑝 &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) over our baseline run. For the stance scores marked by (*) we aggregate the 3 stance predictions by assigning the majority label if it exists and assigning 'neutral' otherwise. Thus, these values are not as in our official submission described in Section 2.2. We also evaluated stance prediction in a binary (bin.) fashion: either any stance or no stance. nDCG@10 macro F1 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Improving the Task Baseline</head><p>In the post-task evaluation, we apply our most promising ChatGPT-based re-ranking strategies to the official task baseline run. Again, our re-ranking consistently improves over the baseline, although the improvements are not statistically significant (see the upper part (Ours w/ BL) of Table <ref type="table" coords="8,129.76,469.28,3.65,10.91">1</ref>). Overall, the most effective systems combine the official task baseline with our stance-based re-ranking approaches stance_ChatGPT and stance-certainNO_ChatGPT, resulting in an nDCG@10 score of about 0.84 for both quality and relevance dimensions. In general, while our re-ranking strategies consider only the argument quality estimation and predicted stance (unless there are ties), they also improve the relevance-based ranking effectiveness. This observation aligns with the findings of previous Touché iterations <ref type="bibr" coords="8,470.18,537.03,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,484.26,537.03,7.57,10.91" target="#b5">4]</ref>. A possible reason is that documents that contain high-quality arguments tend to be perceived as more relevant by human annotators. A precise investigation of the reasons for this observation might be an interesting avenue for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we described our participation in the Touché shared task on argument retrieval for controversial questions. With our proposed approaches, we aimed to investigate the influence of ranking documents based on the predicted argument quality and stance on the overall document ranking effectiveness. Thus, we proposed to re-rank initially retrieved documents with BM25F by boosting the position in the ranked list of documents that have a higher rhetorical argument quality and by penalizing documents that do not take any stance.</p><p>While none of our approaches submitted to the task were able to outperform the official task baseline, our re-ranking strategies improved the retrieval effectiveness of our initial ranked list of documents. These improvements, however, were not sufficient to reach the task baseline effectiveness, due to the much worse performance of our first-stage retrieval. We also found that ChatGPT used for argument quality prediction contributed to better improvements than our trained feature-based classifiers. Additionally, we applied our most promising ChatGPT-based re-ranking strategies to the official task baseline result. Our re-ranking consistently improved over the baseline, although the improvements were not statistically significant.</p><p>Our experiments showed the potential of including argument quality and stance predictions into retrieval pipelines for queries that address controversial topics and thus request highquality argumentation in retrieved documents. Interesting directions for future work might be improving the effectiveness of argument quality and stance classifiers as well as developing more sophisticated re-ranking approaches.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1" xml:id="foot_0" coords="2,92.57,649.05,117.74,8.97"><p>https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt</p></note>
