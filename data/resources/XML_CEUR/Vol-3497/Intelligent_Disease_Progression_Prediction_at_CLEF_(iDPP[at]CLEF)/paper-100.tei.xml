<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that causes the disruption of the ability of the nervous system to transmit signals thus resulting in a progressive neurologic impairment. Unfortunately, MS onset and progression are extremely heterogeneous across patients that tend to have significantly different management and treatment needs. This heterogeneity in disease progression is among the main aspects of MS that hinder efforts to assess the efficacy of developmental treatments designed to delay disease progression, improve the patient's quality of life, and prolong survival. Consequently, the prediction of disease progression has vastly gained interest among researchers in recent years, with the main aims of deriving new relevant insights into disease mechanisms and manifestations and enabling better treatment development. However, this crucial point has not yet been sufficiently addressed mostly due to insufficient access to rich clinical datasets and effective methodologies. Developed in the context of the iDPP@CLEF 2023 challenge, this work aims at developing different machine-learning approaches to predict a worsening in patient disability caused by MS using a shared dataset provided by the challenge organisers. Results were modest (C-Index and AUROC ∼ 0.6) and employing non-linear methods did not lead to a discernible advantage with respect to the well-known Cox proportional hazard model. Exploring alternative, more sophisticated, machine learning techniques or improving data pre-processing to obtain more relevant input features may help in augmenting model discrimination and obtaining satisfactory results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the demyelination of nerve cells. This damage leads to the disruption of the ability of affected parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a progressive neurologic impairment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,375.64,86.97,11.27,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Typically, clinical practice is aimed at keeping the progression of the disability caused by the disease under control. As an obstacle, however, MS onset and progression are extremely heterogeneous across patients <ref type="bibr" coords="2,491.93,114.06,11.44,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which, as a result, exhibit significantly different management and treatment needs. This poses challenges for caregivers and clinicians who would benefit from the possibility of preemptively identifying the need for specific interventions or tailored therapeutic decisions that would have significant implications for the patient's quality of life. Therefore, developing automatic tools that could aid the clinicians' decision-making process to facilitate therapeutic choices would be of uttermost importance.</p><p>Specifically, this paper addresses the challenge proposed in the context of iDPP@CLEF 2023, in which participants were asked to rank subjects based on their risk of experiencing a worsening in the MS progression course. The challenge consisted of two Tasks. In Task 1, the prediction problem was cast as a survival analysis task where developed algorithms should reflect how early a patient experiences a worsening event. In Task 2, participants were asked to explicitly assign the cumulative probability of worsening at different prediction horizons, namely: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. The worsening event was defined according to clinical standards by considering Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.41,303.75,12.83,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> values over time. In particular, for each Task, two different clinically-relevant definitions of worsening were considered for as many sub-tasks (a and b), as detailed in Section 3. For each sub-task, participants were given a dataset containing 2.5 years of visits, with the occurrence (yes/no) of the worsening event and the time of the event. The data came from two Italian clinical institutions, one in Pavia and the other in Turin, and consisted of fully anonymised data from real-world MS patients.</p><p>To address the proposed problems, three different survival analysis approaches were used: the Cox proportional hazard model, the survival support vector machine (SSVM), and the random survival forest (RSF), refining the pipeline employed to an ALS patients cohort to address the previous iDPP@CLEF Challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,233.78,425.70,11.23,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.61,425.70,7.49,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Performance was evaluated via the metrics identified by the challenge organisers, i.e., C-index for Task 1, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and O/E ratio for Task 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.58,452.79,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.67,452.79,7.57,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related works and the main methodological approaches implemented until now to address MS progression prediction. Section 3 describes our approach in terms of data preprocessing and adopting machine learning techniques. Section 4 discusses the findings and, finally, Section 5 draws conclusions and presents the outlook for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Different approaches have been proposed in the literature to describe and predict the prognosis of MS patients.

Classification tasks, such as the prediction, at a given time, of the occurrence of a clinically relevant event, are mainly based on support vector machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,141.16,16.45,10.91" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,108.47,141.16,12.34,10.91" target="#b18">19]</ref>, RF <ref type="bibr" coords="3,142.09,141.16,17.94,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and logistic regression <ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.78,141.16,16.44,10.91" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,284.95,141.16,12.47,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>; Cox proportional hazard model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.95,141.16,16.27,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and RSF are the most frequent approaches in the survival analysis setting.</p><p>The vast majority of literature models use as predictors a set of variables collected at a visit considered as baseline (e.g., the visit at the time of MS diagnosis, or the first visit of a clinical trial), however, studies that considered as predictors variables collected over a 1-2 year time window around a baseline visit showed promising results <ref type="bibr" coords="3,352.49,208.91,16.42,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. More recently, also variables derived from MRI images (i.e., the number and location of T1 or T2 lesions) have started to be considered as possible predictors of MS progression, showing good predictive power <ref type="bibr" coords="3,471.95,236.01,16.50,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,491.17,236.01,12.37,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Finally, it is worth mentioning that many literature models have been developed on top of specific clinical trial datasets instead of datasets collected during everyday clinical practice. This may be a potential limitation to the practical use of predictive models by clinicians as models developed specifically after a clinical trial may struggle to perform well in a different and broader context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>This paragraph describes the experimental workflow using the nomenclature used in the iDPP challenge guidelines. The two tasks will be referred to as:</p><p>• Task 1: predicting risk of disease worsening in MS; • Task 2: predicting cumulative probability of worsening in MS; and the two subtasks as:</p><p>• subtask a: the patient crosses the threshold EDSS ≥ 3 at least twice within a one-year interval; • subtask b: the second definition of worsening depends on the first recorded value, according to current clinical practice:</p><p>if the baseline is EDSS &lt; 1, then the worsening event occurs when an increase of EDSS by 1.5 points is first observed; -if the baseline is 1 ≤ EDSS &lt; 5.5, then the worsening event occurs when an increase of EDSS by 1 point is first observed; -if the baseline is EDSS ≥ 5.5, then the worsening event occurs when an increase of EDSS by 0.5 points is first observed.</p><p>A common preprocessing and model-training pipeline was devised and applied to all subtaskspecific datasets provided by the organisers.</p><p>The following sections describe: i) the data processing steps needed to obtain the final set of static and dynamic input variables (sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2); the data filtering step aimed at excluding scarcely populated variables and subjects (section 3.1.3); the normalisation (section 3.1.5) and imputation (section 3.1.6) steps; the model-independent workflow for training, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimisation via bootstrap resampling (section 3.1.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>The data were made available in several .csv files, ad described in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,370.22,107.54,11.23,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,383.62,107.54,7.49,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>, reporting static variables, and dynamic assessments, such as information about the relapses, the EDSS measurements, the evoked potentials, the MRI, and the MS course of the subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Static Variables' Preprocessing</head><p>In the raw data, sex was reported as a string with two levels: "male" and "female". It was then mapped to a Boolean variable such that 0 = "male" and 1 = "female". Similarly, the variable centre, which records the clinical centre from which the data originated, was converted to a Boolean variable such that 0 = "Pavia" and 1 = "Turin".</p><p>For the residence area classification, there were three possible levels: "rural area," "towns," and "cities". The two dummy variables included in the models were residence_rural_area, and residence_towns. The variable ethnicity only assumed the value "Caucasian", therefore it was discarded from the predictors. While it is not used to build the models, it is essential to account for the fact that the built models are only trained on Caucasian subjects.</p><p>The column other_symptoms was discarded because of the low percentage of valorised rows (2%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Dynamic Variables' Preprocessing</head><p>One of the dynamic variables available for iDPP Challenge was the EDSS, as measured and reported by the clinician, together with the corresponding date of annotation. To describe the score's evolution during the observation window provided, four variables were derived for each subject: the minimum EDSS value (min_EDSS), the maximum EDSS value (max_EDSS), the first EDSS value (first_EDSS), and the last EDSS value (last_EDSS).</p><p>The second dynamic dataset carried information related to the evoked potentials (EP): the type of EP tested, the location examined, the date, and a Boolean variable to account for alterations. In the proposed models, alterations in EP were accounted as Boolean variables, divided by location (altered_auditory_EP, altered_somatosensory_EP, and altered_visual_EP). For each subject, the variable has value = 1 if an alteration in that EP was ever recorded, and 0 otherwise. MRI assessments were also made available together with the date of the visit and reported details on the examined area, T1 lesions presence, T1 gadolinium-enhanced lesions presence and number, new T2 lesions presence and number, and total T2 lesions presence and number. To embed this information in the static dataset, we mapped the original columns as follows:</p><p>• brain_stem_T1_lesions_gadolinium: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T1 gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the Brain Stem area, 0 otherwise. • brain_stem_T2_lesions: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T2 lesion in the Brain Stem area, 0 otherwise. • max_brain_stem_T1_lesions_gadolinium: is the maximum value registered in the column number_of_lesions_T1_gadolinium for mri_area_label equal to "Brain Stem". • max_brain_stem_T2_lesions: is the maximum value registered in the column number_of_total_lesions_T2 for mri_area_label equal to "Brain Stem".</p><p>• cervical_spinal_cord_T1_lesions_gadolinium: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T1 gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the Cervical Spinal Cord area, 0 otherwise. • cervical_spinal_cord_T2_lesions: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T2 lesion in the Cervical Spinal Cord area, 0 otherwise. • max_cervical_spinal_cord_T1_lesions_gadolinium: is the maximum value registered in the column number_of_lesions_T1_gadolinium for mri_area_label equal to "Cervical Spinal Cord'. • max_cervical_spinal_cord_T2_lesions: is the maximum value registered in the column emphnumber_of_total_lesions_T2 for mri_area_label equal to "Cervical Spinal Cord". • spinal_cord_T1_lesions_gadolinium: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T1 gadolinium-enhanced lesion in the Spinal Cord area, 0 otherwise. • spinal_cord_T2_lesions: Boolean, has value 1 if the subject had at least one T2 lesion in the Spinal Cord area, 0 otherwise. • max_spinal_cord_T1_lesions_gadolinium: is the maximum value registered in the column number_of_lesions_T1_gadolinium for mri_area_label equal to "Spinal Cord". • max_spinal_cord_T2_lesions: is the maximum value registered in the column emphnum-ber_of_total_lesions_T2 for mri_area_label equal to "Spinal Cord".</p><p>As for the MS type, the information was not reported for 230 subjects over 440. This information was thus discarded for the scarcity of records.</p><p>Another piece of dynamic information was related to the relapses experienced by each subject. In the dedicated sheet, for each subject was available the date on which a relapse started: in the proposed models, this information was accounted for by deriving, for each subject, the number of relapses that occurred during the proposed observation period (n_relapses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Quality Control</head><p>Once all variables were converted and embedded in the static dataset, a data quality analysis was performed to verify that each variable had more than 70% valid values and that no subjects had more than 20% of missing values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Bootstrap</head><p>A total of 100 bootstrap sets, each having the same size as the entire dataset, were created from the training set made available by the challenge organisers. These bootstrap sets were employed as internal training sets, containing approximately 63.2% of the subjects, with the possibility of subject repetition. The remaining 36.8% of subjects, called out-of-bag subjects, were used as the corresponding validation set.</p><p>To ensure an effective model training process, a stratification analysis was performed on each bootstrap set to evaluate the extent to which the considered variables were appropriately distributed between the internal training set and the respective validation set. In order to assess the adequacy of the stratification, a comparison of variable distributions was conducted for each training/test pair. Statistical tests were employed based on the type of variable: the Kruskal-Wallis test <ref type="bibr" coords="5,176.54,664.75,17.95,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was utilized for continuous variables, while the Chi-squared test <ref type="bibr" coords="5,488.04,664.75,17.95,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> was employed for categorical and ordinal variables. The stratification of a variable was deemed satisfactory based on the outcome of the corresponding test. The percentage of well-stratified variables for each split was calculated using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,173.82,136.92,332.81,24.43">𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐 𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙-𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑓 𝑖𝑒𝑑 = 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 * 100<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Finally, to ensure a thorough and balanced analysis of performance, while accounting for computational complexity, the k bootstrap sets with the highest percentage of well-stratified variables were selected. The number of final bootstrap sets k was determined as the minimum number of bootstrap sets such that each subject is included in the validation set at least five times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.5.">Normalisation</head><p>Normalisation is helpful to avoid introducing bias related to the different dynamic ranges of each variable, and to promote consistency between the scale of the coefficients that might be estimated during model training. Here, min-max scaling was used. In practice, let x be the variable to be normalised, this method constrains x into the range [0, 1] according to the following equation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,232.19,338.50,274.45,24.43">𝑥 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 = 𝑥 -𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥) -𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The normalisation parameters were derived separately on the k selected internal training sets and applied to the respective k validation sets.</p></div>

The imputation parameters were estimated separately on the k selected internal training sets and applied to the respective k validation sets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model Training</head><p>Three survival analysis methods were considered, namely: Cox, SSVM, and RSF. They were chosen to represent a broad spectrum of methodological approaches including parametric (SSVM), semi-parametric (Cox), linear (Cox, SSVM), and nonlinear (RSF) models. The same training workflow, based on feature selection and hyperparameter optimisation was considered for all models. The Cox model and the RSF give as output the survival function. The survival function is characterised by survival probabilities that can easily be inverted to obtain a risk score to be used to rank MS patients according to their risk of worsening (𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘(𝑡) = 1 -𝑆(𝑡)). Such probabilities can be used to address Task 1 by considering the risk at the maximum observed time (𝑡 = 15 years), and Task 2 by considering the risks at the requested times (𝑡 ∈ (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) years). Instead, the SSVM can be used either as a ranker or a time regressor depending on how the risk ratio hyperparameter is set during model training. Here, the SSVM was initially trained as a time regressor, then, its predicted times were converted into worsening probabilities in the range [0-1] using Platt scaling <ref type="bibr" coords="7,223.13,141.16,17.76,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for each time window of interest (Task 1: 15 years, Task 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years).</p><p>The same training workflow was used for all considered models (and both sub-tasks). For each bootstrap set, an optimal model was obtained by performing hyperparameter optimisation and feature selection. Hyperparameters were optimized using a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) and a random search approach <ref type="bibr" coords="7,209.65,208.91,17.91,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> over a given hyperparameter space specific for the considered methodology to be trained. A single hyperparameter was optimised for the Cox model: the strength of the L2 regularisation (𝛼, 500 values randomly sampled from a log-uniform distribution with support [10 -5 -10 5 ]). For the SSVM a linear kernel was used and the rank ratio was set equal to 0 so as to obtain a time regression model. The hyperparameter space consisted of a single hyperparameter: the penalisation weight of the squared hinge loss objective function (𝛽, randomly sampled from a log-uniform distribution with support [10 -3 -10 4 ]). Finally, the RSF's hyperparameter space consisted of two hyperparameters, namely the number of trees in each random forest (n_estimators, uniformly sampled in the interval [40 -500]), and the maximum depth of each tree (uniformly sampled in the interval <ref type="bibr" coords="7,368.33,331.58,32.18,9.57">[2 -10]</ref>). By default, the square root of the total number of features is evaluated at each node for splitting.</p><p>The optimal hyperparameters were chosen as those that maximised the average Harrell's concordance index (C-index) over the five validation folds. The optimal set of features was obtained contextually by using the forward recursive feature selection (FRFS) approach <ref type="bibr" coords="7,471.92,385.05,16.09,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. At each FRFS step, the best feature to be added was chosen as the one that led to the maximum average C-index over the 5 validation folds. The early stopping criterion for FRFS was a relative variation of the average C-index &lt; 0.01%. For feature selection purposes, the optimal model (i.e., the one with the optimal hyperparameters and features set) at each FRFS iteration was applied also to the bootstrap validation set, and the corresponding FRFS-iteration-specific validation C-index was computed. These validation C-indices were used to determine the optimal number of features (N) to be included in the final model. Specifically, the median validation C-index obtained in the considered bootstrap sets, with its variability represented by the 25 𝑡ℎ and 75 𝑡ℎ percentiles, was evaluated as a function of the number of features considered within the FRFS, and the optimal number of features N was selected as the one that led to the maximum median C-index on the validation sets of the boots. In order to select the N features to be included in the final model, the average number of FRFS steps at which each variable was added to the set of predictors in all considered bootstrap sets was considered. If a variable was never selected in a given set, its associated number of steps was set to the maximum number of variables plus one. The final model was, then, trained on the whole training set using only the N variables with the lower average number of steps. The final model's hyperparameters (chosen from the same hyperparameters spaces considered in the previous step) were optimised again via 5-fold cross-validation and a random search approach. The optimal hyperparameters were chosen as those that led to the maximum cross-validation C-index on the 5 validations folds.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Task 2 Results</head><p>Task 2 runs were derived from Task 1 models as explained in Section 3.2. Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 present and analyze the performance metrics for subtasks a and b, respectively. The tables 2 and 3 show the performance metrics for each time horizon considered (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years) for subtasks a and b, respectively. For each time horizon, the upper line of the table reports the AUROC values, while the lower line displays the O/E ratios. These metrics are reported for each considered method, namely Cox, RSF, and SSVM, which are presented in separate columns, together with their 95% confidence intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Subtask a</head><p>For the 2-year time horizon, the Cox method shows the highest AUROC of 0.708, indicating better predictive performance compared to RSF (0.604) and SSVM (0.624). However, when considering the O/E ratio, all three methods have relatively similar performance, with Cox having a slightly higher value of 0.389 compared to RSF (0.385) and SSVM (0.358). Moving to the 4-year time horizon, the Cox method maintains its superiority in terms of AUROC (0.762), outperforming RSF (0.644) and SSVM (0.631). Similarly, the Cox and RSF methods obtain similar O/E ratios of 0.577 and 0.604, respectively, whereas the SSVM O/E ratio is equal to 0.405. Also for the 6-year time horizon, the Cox method reaches the highest AUROC (0.728) concerning RSF (0.638) and SSVM (0.643). Regarding the O/E ratio, Cox (0.539) and RSF (0.520) perform comparably, while SSVM (0.357) shows slightly worse performance. In the 8-year time horizon scenario, the SSVM method has C-index equal to 0.697, outperforming Cox (0.650) and RSF (0.556). At the same time, the O/E ratio favours Cox (0.547) and RSF (0.570), with SSVM (0.328)  In summary, for different time horizons, the Cox method consistently exhibits competitive performance in terms of AUROC, outperforming RSF and SSVM in most cases. However, when considering the O/E ratio, Cox and RSF models often obtain comparable performance, while the SSVM model in most cases has a lower score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Subtask b</head><p>For the 2-year time horizon, the Cox method achieves the highest AUROC (0.642), followed by SSVM (0.547) and RSF (0.514). In terms of O/E ratio, Cox (1.098) has the highest value, followed by RSF (0.966) and SSVM (0.814). For the 4-year time horizon, the SSVM model reaches AUROC equal to 0.629, outperforming the Cox model (0.807) and RSF (0.529). As for the O/E ratio, Cox (0.807) resulted in the best score, followed by RSF (0.711) and SSVM (0.520). Examining the 6-year time horizon, the AUROC is higher for the Cox (0.601), followed by SSVM (0.560) and RSF (0.511). Analyzing the O/E ratio, Cox also achieves the highest value of 0.782, outperforming RSF (0.695) and SSVM (0.444). Considering the 8-year time horizon, the RSF method achieves the highest AUROC (0.668), followed by Cox (0.594) and SSVM (0.474), but inspecting the O/E ratios, Cox (0.735) performs the best, followed by RSF (0.672) and SSVM (0.403). Lastly, at the 10-year time horizon, the results are similar, with the RSF method having again the highest AUROC (0.646), followed by Cox (0.622) and SSVM (0.541), and Cox achieving the highest O/E ratio (0.785), followed by RSF (0.705) and SSVM (0.397).</p><p>For this subtask, the best-performing method varies depending on the time horizon when looking at the AUROC values, but the Cox method consistently outperforms the RSF and the SSVM in O/E ratios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>This study aimed to address the first two tasks of the iDPP Challenge, focusing on predicting two different events of interest (subtasks a and b) associated with disease progression in a cohort of MS patients within a survival framework. Three methods were employed, namely Cox, Random Survival Forests, and Survival Support Vector Machines.</p><p>In Task 1, the results revealed poor discrimination abilities across all models. However, the Cox model achieved the best performance, retaining 13 variables after feature selection. In Task 2, the overall performance was modest, with the Cox model reaching again the better scores, particularly in terms of the E/O ratio, across various time horizons and subtasks. While not explicitly mentioned by the challenge, consideration was given to the clinical context and interpretability. In this regard, the Cox model is effective, by providing coefficient estimates for identified prognostic factors. Nonetheless, striking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance remains crucial when selecting the optimal model for a specific task.</p><p>The obtained results are consistent with the findings in the literature. Chalckou et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,487.94,430.13,18.04,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> reported a C-index of 0.6, which aligns with our findings. Similarly, Ye et al. achieved a C-index of 0.67 on the training set and 0.59 on the test set <ref type="bibr" coords="11,311.34,457.22,16.28,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, some authors have achieved better results. For instance, Pisani et al. utilized random survival forests to predict the time to secondary progressive MS, considering therapy, and achieved an overall accuracy of 88%, along with a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 92% <ref type="bibr" coords="11,298.68,497.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>The limited performance could potentially be attributed to the process of feature selection. In future developments, a revision of the selection made from the pool of available variables will be undertaken. Recursive Feature Elimination will also be tested as an alternative to the forward approach, aiming to mitigate any potential issues associated with early stopping.</p><p>Our findings indicate that employing non-linear or complex methods does not lead to a discernible advantage. Nonetheless, exploring alternative machine learning techniques may help in augmenting model discrimination in survival analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,89.29,327.53,416.69,8.93;8,88.93,339.54,417.05,8.87;8,89.29,351.49,264.25,8.87;8,130.96,84.19,333.36,235.92"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Model training workflow depiction.
