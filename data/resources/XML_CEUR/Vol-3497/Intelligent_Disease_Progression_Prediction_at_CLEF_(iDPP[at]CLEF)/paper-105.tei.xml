<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which gradual destruction of the myelin causes interruption or disordered transmission of nerve impulses. its cause remains uncertain and treatment is unsatisfactory. In the Intelligent Disease Progression Prediction challenge, participants were offered two prediction tasks focused on the progression of Multiple Sclerosis by using demographical and clinical features. We employ machine learning methods for survival analysis. All models were optimized through a cross-validation procedure and finally evaluated on an internal test set. The three best performing methods, namely Elastic-net-penalized Cox model(CoxNet), Component-wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis and and an hybrid method combining both, have been submitted for evaluation. Our results show that linear survival-analysis models could reach Cindex values greater than 0.77 and 0.62 respectively in predicting MS worsening and cumulative risk of worsening. However feature-importance analysis also suggests that usage of semi-quantitative features, such as the EDSS scale, mask the importance, and potential usefulness, of most of the other features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic diseases characterized by progressive or alternate impairment of neurological functions (motor, sensory, visual, cognitive). Patients have to manage alternated periods in hospital with care at home, experiencing a constant uncertainty regarding the timing of the disease acute phases and facing a considerable psychological and economic burden that also involves their caregivers. Clinicians, on the other hand, need tools able to support them in all the phases of the patient treatment, suggest personalized therapeutic decisions, indicate urgently needed interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Predicting Risk of Multiple Sclerosis Worsening</head><p>The prediction tasks focused on ranking subjects based on the risk of worsening, setting the problem as a survival analysis (SA) task, where the event of interest is the risk of MS worsening. The event definition has been based on changes in the patients Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.66,146.61,14.55,12.44" target="#b0">[1]</ref> score, accordingly to clinical standards, for which different definitions have been provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1.">Tasks</head><p>Task 1 asks for the prediction of the risk of worsening according to different definitions. In Subtask 1a, the worsening event is defined as the patient surpassing the EDSS threshold of 3 at least twice within one year interval. In Subtask 1b, the definition of worsening depends on the baseline EDSS value accordingly to current clinical protocols, namely:</p><p>• if baseline EDSS &lt; 1, worsening occurs when an increase of EDSS by 1.5 points is first observed; • if 1 ≤ baseline EDSS &lt; 5.5, worsening occurs when an increase of EDSS by 1.0 point is first observed; • if baseline EDSS ≥ 5.5, worsening occurs when an increase of EDSS by 0.5 points is first observed.</p><p>Task 2 required to explicitly assign a probability of worsening at different time windows (after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years) according to the worsening event definition provided for Tasks 1a and 1b respectively.</p><p>For each sub-task, participants were given a dataset containing 2.5 years of visits, with the occurrence of the worsening event and the time of occurrence pre-computed by the challenge organizers.</p><p>For more details on the iDPP Challenge at CLEF 2023 and the tasks please refer to the overview papers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.50,460.35,11.36,12.44" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,179.59,460.35,7.57,12.44" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p></div>

Their results is not reported.</p><p>Model performance has been estimated by taking the average and standard deviation across 50 reshuffling rounds of five-fold cross-validation.</p><p>For some of the methods hyper-parameter optimization has been performed. See Table <ref type="table" coords="2,485.81,654.46,5.07,12.44" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for their values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0.1.">EvilCox</head><p>During model development, we routinely performed Permutation-based Feature Importance Analisys <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.70,219.33,13.42,12.44" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, as implemented in the scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,300.64,219.33,16.61,12.44" target="#b9">[10]</ref> package, on each trained model. Feature permutation importance is a general strategy to measure the contribution of each feature on the prediction score by scrambling the analyzed-feature values to destroy correlation. We observed that CWGBSA is very resistent to over-fitting and does implicit feature selection, as Coxnet does, but it appears to be more aggressive with respect to feature elimination. Nonetheless CWGBSA cross-validated performance turned out to be almost on par with that of CoxNet, despite using a rather smaller set of features. Since CWGBSA approaches a linear least-square solution as the number of estimators grows, we tested a hybryd method where CWGBSA acts as as a feature selector for CoxNet. This was done simply by selecting all features whose average (over 50 runs) contribution to the score was larger than 0.001 and using them to build a CoxNet model. In our tests, the cross-validated score of EvilCox outperformed that of the CoxNet model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Feature engineering</head><p>Each data set provided had a training set comprising a table of static features, a table of longitudinal (temporal) features and a table of outcomes.</p><p>While static features are collected once for each individual, longitudinal features are collected repeatedly at different time points for the same individual. A variable had thus a different number of values (possibly also one or zero) for each individual. Since we did not use predictive methods that could handle longitudinal data directly, we re-coded the multiple values that were available for each individual for a longitudinal feature as several static features: the number, the mean, the standard deviation, the maximum, minimum, first (earliest collection time), second-to-last and last (most recent collection time) value for both EDSS values and time of EDSS evaluation. We also collected the number of EDSS evaluation above the three thresholds of 1.5, 3.0 and 5.5 (over_t1,over_t2, over_t3) for each patient.</p><p>Categorical features and boolean features with missing values were one-hot-encoded. All features with more than 40% of missing values in the training set were dropped. All the remaining missing values after feature dropping have been given a value equal to the median of the corresponding feature value.</p><p>The predicted time-to-event 𝑡 &gt; 0 risk was converted into a relative risk 0 &lt; 𝑟 &lt; 1 by rescaling it to fall within the its maximum and minimum value 𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑙 (𝑡) = 𝑟(𝑡) -𝑟 𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑟 𝑚𝑎𝑥 -𝑟 𝑚𝑖𝑛</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0.1.">Task 1</head><p>As usual for survival-analysis tasks, Task 1 performance has been graded according to Harrell's concordance index <ref type="bibr" coords="4,196.09,143.83,18.87,12.44" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (C-index), both by cross-validation on the training set and on the challenge test set. Results are reported in table 2.</p><p>Our models performance are significantly better for task 1a than for task 1b, where the definition of the event changes according to the patient first EDSS evaluation. Furthermore, for task 1a, the training score is very consistent with respect to the testing results, showing very good generalization. Both the CWGBSA and EvilCox methods perform very well even when using a significantly smaller feature set. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0.2.">Feature importance</head><p>Feature importance analysis shows *Fig1, somewhat unsurprisingly, that the most important features for subtask a are different from those that describe subtask b, although all the methods consistently select similar features for the same task. In particular, subtask a feature importance is largely dominated by the most recent EDSS evaluation while the two most relevant feature for the subtask b are 1) the difference between the two most recent EDSS values and 2) the number of EDSS evaluation with score over 3.0.</p><p>In general, EDSS-related features dominate the feature-importance landscape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.0.3.">Task 2</head><p>The survival methods we use in Task 1 can output their prediction both as a relative risk and as survival curve. So we took the same models fitted in Task 1 and used their predicted survival curve to get the Task 2 outcome. Two metrics have been used in Task 2, namely the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) at each time threshold and the observed/expected events (O/E) ratio for each time interval.</p><p>Results are reported in table <ref type="table" coords="4,228.08,626.57,5.07,12.44" target="#tab_3">3</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We tried a series of standard with good results for subtask a and lower perforamces for subtask b. While subtask a has a fixed threshold, subtask b outcome is a relative increment in EDSS score, which seems to be more challenging to predict.</p><p>Beyond the methods we submitted to the challenge, which are all linear, we experimented also with non-linear models such as Random Survival Forest. However, linear models consistently outperformed non-linear ones, while non-linear ones suffered more from over-fitting.</p><p>While the best models were the CoxNet ones, it is possible to get a good model fit even with very few features: CWGBSA and EvilCox models used only six features. In particular, the feature-importance space is dominated by the EDSS most recent evaluations. While the importance of previous EDSS evaluations is not surprising given that the outcomes are also EDSS-derived, few non-EDSS features were found to be predictive. A rationale for this behaviour might be that, being EDSS a semi-quantitative feature, it summarizes the contribution of the other features through the clinician judgement, making difficult to factorize other con- tributions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,89.29,421.66,416.70,11.36;5,89.29,433.62,269.34,11.36"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Permutation importance in the CoxnNet models fitted for subtasks a and b.
