<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition which, in combination with environmental factors, leads to inflammatory demyelination of the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis begin with a relapsing-remitting (RR) course. Over time, however, most progress to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which is characterized by a gradual and progressive worsening of the disease. MS is the second most common cause of disability in young adults. Identifying prognostic factors for disease progression early in its course is critical for evaluating possible therapeutic interventions.</p><p>This paper presents a maximum likelihood estimation approach for predicting the progression of multiple sclerosis. The work is part of the iDPP challenge at CLEF 2023. The iDPP challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="1,89.29,541.22,12.84,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> includes (but is not limited to) the following two tasks:</p><p>• Task 1: Predicting the risk of disease worsening -predicting the risk of worsening and ranking subjects based on the risk scores. More specifically, the risk of worsening should be a value between 0 and 1 that reflects how early a patient experiences the worsening event.</p><p>• Task 2: Predicting the cumulative probability of worsening -assigning cumulative probability of worsening at different time windows, i.e. between years 0 and 2, 0 and 4, 0 and 6, 0 and 8, 0 and 10.</p><p>In addition, for each task, we consider two different subtasks based on two alternative definitions of worsening. Following clinical standards, worsening is defined on the basis of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS):</p><p>• Subtask A: the patient crosses the EDSS ≥ 3 threshold at least twice within a one-year interval. • Subtask B: the first recorded EDSS value available in clinical records is defined as the baseline, and worsening occurs according to the following rules:</p><p>if the baseline is EDSS &lt; 1, then worsening occurs when an EDSS increase of 1.5 points is first observed. -if the baseline is 1 ≤ EDSS &lt; 5.5, then worsening occurs when an EDSS increase of 1 point is first observed. -if the baseline is EDSS ≥ 5.5, then worsening occurs when an EDSS increase of 0.5 points is first observed.</p><p>Finally, for each subtask, we are given a separate dataset consisting of general patient information, as well as a series of observations over 2.5 years. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related works; Section 3 describes our approach; Section 4 explains our experimental setup; Section 5 discusses our main findings; finally, Section 6 draws some conclusions and outlooks for future work.</p></div>

However, it employs a log-linear function to predict the outcome variable from the covariates. In this sense, it may not be suitable to properly predict a multiple sclerosis patient outcome without extensive feature engineering.</p><p>Recently, deep learning has been applied to extend the Cox proportional hazard model. More specifically, the DeepSurv model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.19,588.29,12.68,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> employs a multi-layered perceptron to replace the log-linear function of the Cox proportional hazards model. Similar to the Cox proportional hazard model, DeepSurv assumes a constant baseline hazard.</p><p>In addition, DeepHit <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.63,628.93,12.69,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has proposed discretizing the space of event times, and using a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times. Further, DeepHit does not make any assumptions about the underlying stochastic process, and has the ability to handle competing risks.</p><p>Random survival forests <ref type="bibr" coords="3,213.23,86.97,18.07,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is a non-parametric method that constitutes an extension of the random forest method approach <ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.37,100.52,16.36,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. More specifically, random survival forests learn an ensemble of trees for the analysis of right-censored survival data.</p><p>The idea of using a deep learning framework to estimate probability distribution parameters for maximum likelihood estimation for right-censored data was initially introduced by Nagpal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,113.09,154.71,17.91,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as a part of their deep survival machines (DSM) framework. DSM employs a mixture of individual parametric survival distributions to fit a set of right-censored survival data. The work was further extended to recurrent deep survival machines (RDSM) by Nagpal et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.07,181.81,17.91,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with the introduction of recurrent neural networks in place of the learnt representations. Unlike DSM and RDSM, we do not use a mixture of parametric distributions but rather focus on fitting the parameters of a single parametric probability distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section we describe the methodology we have adopted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>We assume that we are given right-censored data which consists of a set of 𝐼 triples {(x 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑖 , 𝛿 𝑖 )} 𝐼 𝑖=1 . For each 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐼, the real vector x 𝑖 ∈ R 𝑑 denotes the features of the 𝑖-th entry. Further, 𝑡 𝑖 is either the censoring time, or the time an event occurred. In addition, 𝛿 𝑖 is an indicator variable taking a value of 0 if 𝑡 𝑖 is the censoring time, and a value of 1, if 𝑡 𝑖 is the time at which an event took place. It is assumed that for each 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐼 either censoring occurs, or we observe the event but not both.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Maximum Likelihood Formulation</head><p>The method of maximum likelihood can be adapted to various applied problems. In this section, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation approach for intelligent disease progression prediction. Given a set of right-censored patient data {(x 𝑖 , 𝑡 𝑖 , 𝛿 𝑖 )} 𝐼 𝑖=1 , we can assume independence among patients, and thus define the likelihood function of the observed data as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,206.42,512.30,300.22,26.53">𝐿(𝜃) = ∏︁ 𝑖,𝛿 𝑖 =1 𝑓 (𝑡 𝑖 |𝜃 𝑖 ) ∏︁ 𝑖,𝛿 𝑖 =0 (1 -𝐹 (𝑡 𝑖 |𝜃 𝑖 ))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Please note that we do not assume that the patient data is identically distributed. On the contrary, we consider different distribution parameters 𝜃 𝑖 for each patient 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐼. Further, please note that if we knew the distribution functions 𝑓 and 𝐹 , and if we could estimate the distribution parameters 𝜃 𝑖 for a previously unseen patient 𝑖, then we would also be able to estimate the patient's probability of worsening over a given time period. In order to achieve that, we would like to use a parametric family of distributions in the above formulation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,493.41,114.06,10.69,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Hence, we would need to choose a probability distribution with support over the positive real line. In this work, we focus on the Weibull distribution <ref type="bibr" coords="4,347.71,141.16,16.41,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. It is a continuous probability distribution that has closed form expressions for both its probability density function 𝑓 (𝑡), and cumulative density function 𝐹 (𝑡):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,189.09,191.28,317.55,72.41">𝑓 (𝑡|𝛼, 𝛽) := {︃ 0, 𝑡 &lt; 0 𝛽 𝛼 (︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽-1 exp (︁ - (︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽 )︁ , 𝑡 ≥ 0 𝐹 (𝑡|𝛼, 𝛽) := {︃ 0, 𝑡 &lt; 0 1 -exp (︁ - (︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽 )︁ , 𝑡 ≥ 0<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Thus, we can seamlessly apply automatic differentiation in the gradient-based search for the optimal distribution parameters. This allows us to use a feed-forward neural network with fully connected layers as the function mapping feature inputs x 𝑖 to estimated distribution parameters 𝜃 𝑖 = (𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑖 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,91.82,339.56,414.82,23.78">Ψ(A, b, x) := 𝜎(A 𝑁 𝜎(A 𝑁 -1 𝜎(. . .

As the logarithm function is monotonic, we can equivalently write problem (4) as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,117.03,241.06,401.92,90.26">(︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽-1 exp (︁ - (︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽 )︁ , 𝑡 ≥ 0 𝐹 (𝑡|𝛼, 𝛽) := {︃ 0, 𝑡 &lt; 0 1 -exp (︁ - (︀ 𝑡 𝛼 )︀ 𝛽 )︁ , 𝑡 ≥ 0 Ψ(A, b, x) := 𝜎(A 𝑛 𝜎(A 𝑛-1 𝜎(. . . A 3 𝜎(A 2 𝜎(A 1 x + b 1 ) + b 2 ) + b 3 . . . ) + b 𝑛-1 ) + b 𝑛 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Please note that even in the case when the activation function 𝜎 is the identity map, the proposed formulation is neither convex, nor concave. Thus, in general, we cannot find a global optimal solution to the proposed model using gradient-type methods. However, sub-optimal solutions of reasonable quality can be found, as indicated in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Setup</head><p>In this section, we describe our experimental setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Implementation</head><p>The training pipeline is implemented in the julia programming language <ref type="bibr" coords="5,414.17,493.08,16.23,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Further, we use the Knet library <ref type="bibr" coords="5,160.89,506.63,17.75,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for our neural network implementation. Our code is available on bitbucket. We run training and testing steps on a Core i7 CPU with 16 GB of RAM. What is more, we use a validation set to determine the values of our hyper-parameters. Moreover, we use the Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,165.69,547.28,18.07,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> with a learning rate of 0.00001. While the value may seem somewhat small, we found it to work well in practice. In addition, we do not split the data into batches but rather use the entire training dataset for each step of Adam. Furthermore, we apply dropout regularization <ref type="bibr" coords="5,155.69,587.92,16.56,10.91" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,175.00,587.92,14.11,10.91" target="#b18">19]</ref> to the input layer with a dropout rate chosen among 0.01 and 0.2. We choose the number of hidden units in the neural network among 100 and 200. Finally, the number of training epochs (which also equals the number of training steps of Adam) is chosen among 5000 and 10000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Datasets</head><p>We are given two different datasets, one for subtask A, and one for subtask B. In this way, task 1A and task 2A both use the first dataset, while task 1B and task 2B both use the second dataset. Each dataset contains 2.5 years of patient visits. In addition, the occurrence of the worsening event, as well as the time of its occurrence are also given.</p><p>The training and testing data of both datasets (subtask A and subtask B) is partitioned into static patient data and dynamic patient data. Furthermore, the dynamic patient data includes information on relapses, EDSS scores, evoked potentials, MRI results and multiple sclerosis course.</p><p>The training dataset for subtask A includes the following: 441 patients, 481 relapses, 2,661 EDSS scores, 1,211 evoked potentials, 960 MRIs, and 310 multiple sclerosis courses. The training dataset for subtask B includes the following: 511 patients, 553 relapses, 3,069 EDSS scores, 1,522 evoked potentials, 966 MRIs, and 325 multiple sclerosis courses. In addition, the testing dataset of subtask A includes the following: 111 patients, 95 relapses, 675 EDSS scores, 278 evoked potentials, 236 MRIs, and 68 multiple sclerosis courses. And the testing dataset of subtask B includes the following: 129 patients, 125 relapses, 813 EDSS scores, 299 evoked potentials, 266 MRIs, and 75 multiple sclerosis courses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>The challenge objectives consist of the following:</p><p>• Task 1 -predicting the risk of disease worsening • Task 2 -predicting the cumulative probability of worsening In order to handle both tasks, we use the available training data to build a model and estimate a maximum likelihood distribution for each patient given the patient's covariates (features). Ideally, for task 1 we would have preferred to use coherent risk measures <ref type="bibr" coords="6,420.34,469.98,16.49,10.91" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,439.57,469.98,14.07,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref> to estimate the risk of disease worsening from the patients' distributions.

For instance, the first model in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,295.01,537.73,5.13,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is named "T1b.0.2.1.0e-5.5000.200", indicating that it is a Task 1B model with the following parameters:</p><p>• A dropout rate of 0.2 used in the input layer.</p><p>• A learning rate of 1.0e-5 used by the Adam optimizer. • The model is trained for 5000 epochs, i.e. the Adam optimizer performs 5000 steps.</p><p>• The number of hidden units is set to 200.</p><p>We can see that the highest Harrell's concordance index values fall in the interval [0.6, 0.65]. Ideally, we would like to improve those results in the future. One way we could do that is by incorporating event ordering into the model training procedure. Another approach we could try is scaling down classical coherent risk measures to fit into the [0, 1] interval for the given patient data. In Figures <ref type="figure" coords="7,195.75,100.52,4.65,10.91">2</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,200.39,100.52,4.65,10.91">3</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,200.39,100.52,4.65,10.91">4</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,200.39,100.52,4.65,10.91">5</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,205.04,100.52,4.65,10.91">6</ref>we can see that the highest AUROC exceeds 0.8. In the future, we can further improve those results by better model optimization. In addition, in Figures <ref type="figure" coords="7,471.80,114.06,4.67,10.91">7</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,476.47,114.06,4.67,10.91">8</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,476.47,114.06,4.67,10.91">9</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,476.47,114.06,4.67,10.91" target="#fig_0">10</ref><ref type="figure" coords="7,481.14,114.06,9.34,10.91" target="#fig_0">11</ref>we can find the ratio of observed to expected events for all submitted models.</p><p>The model with the highest AUROC score T2a.0.01.1.0e-5.10000.100.adj has a couple of aspects that distinguish it from the rest of the models. First, for each patient dataframe (static patient data, relapses, EDSS scores, evoked potentials, MRI results and multiple sclerosis course) it explicitly takes into account the length of the dataframe. And second, it normalizes the age_at_onset variable using division by fifty. This suggests that current results can be further improved by additional data pre-processing.</p><p>Finally, in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,171.75,222.46,4.97,10.91">1</ref> we present illustrations of probability density functions for three randomly chosen patients from the test set for the 2a.0.01.1.0e-5.10000.100.adj model. Please note that the risk and the probabilities of worsening for each patient depend entirely on the computed values of the distribution parameters 𝛼 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑖 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>The development of predictive models of the disease is a step forward towards better clinical assessment and an individualized therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis patients.</p><p>In this paper we have developed a maximum likelihood estimation approach for intelligent disease progression prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of such a method being applied to real multiple sclerosis data. Our numerical results indicate that the method can achieve AUROC scores exceeding 0.8. In the future we can explore several directions of further research. First, we can attempt to incorporate event ordering into the training procedure in order to improve Harrell's concordance index scores. Further, we can attempt to apply (scaled-down) coherent risk measures in order to obtain risk estimates in the [0, 1] interval. Finally, we may also look into improving the quality of the numerical solution with the use of second-order optimization methods such as K-FAC <ref type="bibr" coords="7,386.83,457.22,17.91,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or L-BFGS <ref type="bibr" coords="7,456.39,457.22,16.25,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,131.14,374.67,374.85,11.36;4,89.29,388.22,416.69,11.36;4,89.29,401.77,319.43,10.91;4,96.73,427.06,20.30,9.57;4,99.32,436.40,15.13,7.01;4,123.36,423.71,13.94,6.98;4,118.85,442.42,22.97,7.82;4,143.63,427.06,50.11,10.63;4,200.08,423.71,13.94,6.98;4,195.56,442.42,22.97,7.82;4,218.53,427.06,79.40,10.63;4,104.53,455.79,12.50,10.91;4,117.03,473.03,161.28,10.67;4,117.03,489.60,90.73,10.63;4,117.03,506.14,89.92,10.63;4,89.29,521.95,27.74,10.91;4,117.03,551.40,55.13,9.57;4,175.19,539.76,8.79,6.98;4,183.98,542.11,8.49,9.57;4,309.01,542.11,23.94,9.57;4,185.31,556.61,4.75,6.99;4,185.18,565.30,5.44,6.99"><head>( 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>and b are collection of respectively real matrices A 𝑛 , 𝑛 = 1, . . . , 𝑁 , and real vectors b 𝑛 , 𝑛 = 1, . . . , 𝑁 , and 𝜎 is an activation function such as the rectified linear unit.
