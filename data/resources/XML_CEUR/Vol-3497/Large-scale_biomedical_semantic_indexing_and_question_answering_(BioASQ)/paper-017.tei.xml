For the NER subtask, we pre-train a Spanish RoBERTa model with additional Spanish clinical data and fine-tune the model for token classification. After the entities are detected, they are passed to the entity linker which uses the cross-lingual SapBERT XLMR-large to generate entity and mention representations and generates the candidate entity using cosine similarity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper presents our approach to BioASQ Task 3 -MedProcNER: Spanish Medical Procedures Named Entity Recognition, Linking, and Indexing Shared Task ( <ref type="bibr" coords="1,370.43,469.84,10.99,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,387.79,469.84,10.99,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). The challenge focuses on the concept of a clinical procedure -'a set of actions, interventions, or treatments that are carried out by healthcare professionals to diagnose, treat, or manage a patient's medical condition' 1 . Automatic identification and normalization of clinical procedure mentions in unstructured text is crucial for knowledge discovery, facilitating clinical research, building, and integrating systems that ultimately improve the quality of provided healthcare. There are three subtasks 2 :</p><p>• Clinical Procedure Recognition -a named entity recognition task where mentions of clinical procedures must be identified in unstructured Spanish clinical case texts. • Clinical Procedure Normalization -assigning SNOMED CT codes to the clinical procedure mentions identified in the NER subtask. • Clinical Procedure-based Document Indexing -assigning SNOMED CT codes to the full clinical report texts, so that they could be indexed.</p><p>We take part in the first two subtasks -Clinical Procedure Recognition, and Procedure Normalization. The system performs named entity recognition for procedures using a pretrained Spanish RoBERTa model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.40,207.04,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and entity linking using cross-lingual SapBERT XLMR-large <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,220.59,11.37,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We perform several different experiments to compare the performance of different clinical BERT-based language models, including models trained in English, Spanish, or cross-lingual. We investigate the effect of additional pre-training of the Spanish RoBERTa model using taskspecific Spanish data from the procedures gazetteer, as well as the effect of input preprocessing, and we find performance improvements when using both. We also attempt to train an Adapter over the BioM-ALBERT-Large model, which will adapt the English model to Spanish, however, the results shown are lower than the fully trained Spanish RoBERTa model.</p><p>The code related to this task is available on GitHub<ref type="foot" coords="2,328.00,313.68,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Subtask 1 -Named Entity Recognition</head><p>Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental subtask in multiple NLP challenges for Spanish biomedical and clinical texts. Deep neural models are predominantly used to tackle the NER task. In the DisTEMIST <ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.80,422.12,12.88,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> task, the best-performing NER model, developed by Moscato et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,435.67,11.54,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, is based on PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-clinical-es <ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.14,435.67,11.54,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with a classification head on top. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.40,449.22,12.72,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> view the NER task as a machine reading comprehension (question answering) problem by using the definition of the entity as the question, and part of the clinical text as the segment, and training a joint model for the NER and entity linking subtasks. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.38,489.87,13.00,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> achieve the best NER result in the PharmaCoNER <ref type="bibr" coords="2,357.79,489.87,13.00,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> task using a BERT-based <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.92,489.87,18.07,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> model and conditional random fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Subtask 2 -Entity Linking</head><p>Entity linking (EL) is a crucial task for extracting structured data from clinical texts. It usually relies on the result from NER and consists of two steps -generating candidates from a knowledge base of entities, and ranking and selecting the best candidate. The EL approach can take advantage of the global context information to inform the linking decisions based on neighboring linked entities. A common approach used for biomedical entity linking is using deep neural networks to generate entity representations in an embedding space and searching for the closest entities based on a distance metric like cosine similarity. SapBERT and cross-lingual SapBERT were pre-trained using UMLS and have shown very good results for linking for both English and other languages ( <ref type="bibr" coords="3,169.19,100.52,15.88,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.26,100.52,11.25,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). In the case of Spanish biomedical entity linking, the best model on the DisTEMIST dataset used an ensemble of cross-lingual SapBERT and TF-IDF vectorizer based on character n-gram features for candidate generation which scored F1 0.5657 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,457.57,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Other participants in the competition used FastText embeddings and approximate nearest neighbor similarity and scored F1 0.4987 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.40,154.71,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Due to the lack of large corpora of biomedical training data in many languages, approaches using exact match and surface form similarity are still used, for example, several papers in the CanTEMIST competition used the Levenshtein distance metric ( <ref type="bibr" coords="3,92.89,195.36,15.71,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,115.25,195.36,15.71,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</p><p>In some cases, EL and NER can be combined and solved as sequence labeling task, as long as the entity identifier is composed of different hierarchical components, like the tumor codes (ICD-O-3) in CanTEMIST. The highest scoring systems in CanTEMIST use sequence labeling and predict the different tumor code components for each word ( <ref type="bibr" coords="3,379.06,249.56,15.71,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,401.42,249.56,15.71,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">MedProcNER Dataset</head><p>The MedProcNER corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="3,206.39,329.15,18.07,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> contains 1,000 clinical case reports in Spanish annotated with procedure mentions and normalized to SNOMED CT codes. The corpus consists of a fully annotated train set, a smaller test set, as well as a gazetteer of SNOMED-CT codes and different aliases. Statistics about the train and test sets are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,380.23,369.80,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The train set contains 4,857 annotated entities, 1,630 unique entity codes, 3,086 unique entity mentions, 106 nested mentions, and 510 abbreviations. The majority of entities have only one SNOMED-CT code, but there are 51 mentions which have no code selected, and 125 which have more than one code. There are very few ambiguous mentions which are labeled with different codes based on the context -a total of 12.</p><p>The Spanish SNOMED-CT gazetteer contains a total of 234,675 aliases for terms in multiple categories, including procedures, substance, clinical drug, and others. The most important category for this task is procedures. The gazetteer contains 61,714 unique SNOMED-CT codes of procedures and 94,133 total different aliases for procedure terms. The average number of procedure aliases per code is 1.52.</p><p>The corpus has a test set of 250 documents for testing purposes and the annotated version is not public as of the moment of writing this paper. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Language Pre-training Dataset</head><p>We experimented with two different pre-training datasets:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">MedProcNER Gazetteer Dataset</head><p>The dataset consists of all of the terms in the initial version of the MedProcNER gazetteer, each as a separate example. This was the dataset of choice for our pre-trained PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-clinical-es model submission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Custom Spanish Medical Procedure Dataset</head><p>This dataset was compiled to include clinical procedure term descriptions from CIE-10-ES 2022 Procedimientos Tabla de Referencia <ref type="foot" coords="4,252.83,245.09,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">4</ref> , and all term descriptions from the Spanish release of SNOMED CT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.57,260.39,17.76,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> which contain 'procedimiento' and do not contain 'RETIRADO' (deprecated).</p><p>It also includes all sentences from the MedProcNER train and test files, and all unique values in the COMPONENT, SYSTEM, and METHOD_TYP 5 columns of the Spanish (Spain) linguistic variant of LOINC v2.74. Since this set is larger than the gazetteer one, it is only used for training a language adapter for one of the models -a less computationally expensive alternative to full pre-training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Unified Medical Language System Procedures (UMLS) Procedures</head><p>For the purposes of entity linking, we have extracted all procedures from UMLS (2023AA edition) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,126.55,391.41,17.92,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> which are in Spanish, have a Spanish SNOMED CT code, and that code is part of the gazetteer procedure codes. We extracted 80,681 procedure aliases from UMLS, however, about half of them were already present in the MedProcNER gazetteer. The number of new aliases extracted from UMLS was 45,010. We construct the entity-linking knowledge base by combining the UMLS and the gazetteer procedures. The total number of procedure aliases in the knowledge base is 125,691.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methods</head><p>The system performs named-entity recognition and entity linking of procedures in Spanish clinical texts. The overall system architecture is shown on Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,389.40,531.33,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and consists of separate steps for named-entity recognition and entity linking of the procedures.</p><p>After preprocessing, the NER module identifies the spans in the text which contain procedures and they are passed to the Entity Linking module to predict their SNOMED-CT identifiers. As a result, a list of procedure spans and their corresponding identifiers is returned. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>Due to the fact that more than 33% of the clinical case texts exceed the 512 token limit of our models, we split the texts into sentences, and use each sentence as a separate example for fine-tuning. We use the SPACCC Sentence Splitter<ref type="foot" coords="5,323.67,333.97,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">6</ref> . We also replace any number with the 'NUMBER' literal, and remove any punctuation, special characters, and symbols matching the following regex:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,89.29,386.57,248.96,9.27">[~:\'+\[\\@^{%(\-"*|,&amp;&lt;'}._=\]!&gt;;?#$)/®©℠]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Subtask 1 -Named Entity Recognition</head><p>For the NER subtask, we fine-tune a large transformer model with a classification head on the preprocessed MedProcNER train dataset, postprocessing the results to reconstruct the final procedure from tokens. The classification head labels correspond to the 3 classes in the IOB2 annotation scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="5,176.47,475.72,16.25,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The process of pre-training the model using the MedProcNER gazetteer and then fine-tuning it on the MedProcNER train set is shown on figure 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Language Model Pre-training</head><p>We pre-train the model using the masked language model objective and the standard BERT architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="5,146.93,565.69,18.06,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for two epochs using the HuggingFace Transformers library 7 . We use the default value for the probability of masking a token -15%. The MedProcNER gazetteer dataset from Section 3.2 is used to pre-train the model on Spanish medical procedure vocabulary. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,117.10,606.34,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the hyperparameter values used for pre-training. They are the same as the hyperparameters used for pre-training RoBERTa (base) in the original paper <ref type="bibr" coords="5,430.85,619.89,16.25,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The resulting pre-trained language model is used for the downstream NER task.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Classification Model Selection</head><p>We experiment with the following models for the token classifier:</p><p>• PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-clinical-es <ref type="bibr" coords="6,381.62,399.16,13.00,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> -a RoBERTa-based language model, trained on a large Spanish biomedical-clinical corpus of more than 1B tokens. Systems based on this model have achieved competitive results on previous Spanish biomedical-clinical tasks. We further pre-train the model on the Gazetteer dataset. • CLIN-X-ES <ref type="bibr" coords="6,172.90,468.26,17.91,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> -a cross-lingual language model, based on XLM-RoBERTa (large), pretrained on the MeSpEN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,228.24,481.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> dataset, and Spanish clinical documents from the Scielo archive 8 . We use CLIN-X-ES to explore the cross-lingual knowledge transfer capabilities of a multilingual model in the clinical domain. No additional pre-training is done. • BioM-BERT-Large <ref type="bibr" coords="6,211.43,523.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> -a BERT-based model (with ELECTRA architecture) for the biomedical domain, pre-trained exclusively on an English corpus -PubMed Abstracts + PMC + general domain vocab (EN Wiki + Books). It achieves state-of-the-art results on certain bio text classification tasks such as ChemProt. With no further pre-training, BioM BERT serves as a good baseline, proving that cross-lingual knowledge transfer in the biomedical-clinical context is possible to a certain extent even with a monolingual model, likely due to the Latin and Greek etymology of clinical terms. • BioM-ALBERT-Large <ref type="bibr" coords="6,223.19,620.01,17.92,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> -an ALBERT-based model, pre-trained on English PubMed abstracts only. We train a language adapter with the Multiple ADapters for Cross-lingual transfer (MAD-X) architecture which has shown very good results for cross-lingual adaptation <ref type="bibr" coords="7,168.05,86.97,16.41,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We train the adapter layers on the MLM objective using the Custom Spanish Medical Procedure dataset from Section 3.2 for 1 epoch. The core idea is to augment the original model with a new set of parameters, by inserting bottleneck feedforward layers in each layer of the transformer model, and only train these new parameters on the masked language modeling objective for Spanish. This not only speeds up the training process, but also improves modularity and reusability, as multiple adapters can be composed for different tasks, and the adapter parameters are saved and shared separately. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,143.67,181.81,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the hyperparameter values used when training the adapter. We use the default value for masking probability -15%. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Postprocessing</head><p>Since our models are token classifiers, to get the final clinical procedure mentions in the required format for the NER task, we must merge the token class predictions into word class predictions.</p><p>To do this, we use the aggregation capabilities of the Hugging Face token classification pipeline <ref type="foot" coords="7,500.63,370.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">9</ref> , setting the aggregation strategy to 'first'. This groups the tokens of a word, while preserving word boundaries. For instance, 'resonancia magnética' may be tokenized as 'resonancia', 'magnét' and '##ica'. These three tokens may be classified as B-PROCEDIMIENTO, I-PROCEDIMIENTO, and O. The chosen aggregation strategy would override the classification of the last token in order to preserve word boundaries when merging. As a result, 'resonancia magnética' (and not 'resonancia magnét') is recognized as a clinical procedure mention <ref type="foot" coords="7,400.05,452.05,7.41,7.97" target="#foot_4">10</ref> . This approach might be beneficial for models pre-trained exclusively on an English corpus since it is more likely that they misclassify suffixes of out-of-vocabulary words. Note this could only be applied to word-based models, where there is the notion of a word boundary. For the RoBERTa Biomedicalclinical model and the BioM-ALBERT-Large model, we include an additional postprocessing step -removing relatively rare leading and trailing whitespace characters and unclosed parenthesis occurrences which are a result of the preprocessing, e.g. ' PAAF)' is transformed into 'PAAF'.</p></div>

The SapBERT XLMR-large model was pre-trained on UMLS data for all available languages including Spanish using a self-alignment objective so that phrases that represent a concept in different languages are grouped closely in the embedding space. Spanish is the second most common language in UMLS 2020AB and the dataset used to pre-train the model consists of 10.7% Spanish terms.

The highest score on the validation NER model is achieved using the BioM-BERT-Large model, while the highest EL score is achieved using the CLIN-X-ES + SapBERT XLMR-Large model. Overall, most of the models produce very close results and the top-scoring models change when evaluating on the test set. The best-performing model for both NER and EL on the test set is the Pre-trained Spanish RoBERTa which scores 0.71 on NER and 0.53 on the EL task.</p><p>The reason why the entity linking model shows lower results on the validation set may be explained by the fact that the KB it uses has all the validation mentions explicitly removed to account for a worst-case scenario. A more detailed comparison may be performed once the test set annotations become available. where each token is tagged with only one of {B, I, O}. Consequently, a mention that is part of another mention, is not identified. For instance, the following mention 'tomografía axial computarizada (TAC) abdómino-pélvica' contains a nested mention 'TAC' that is not recognised by our model. Since about 2% of the training data consists of nested mentions, the model is not able to recognize them correctly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.2.">Subtask 2 -Entity Linking</head><p>As the linking module uses the results from the NER module, successful linking is limited by the correctly identified mentions. Several factors contribute to entity-linking errors:</p><p>• Zero or multiple codes matching the mention -the model supports the prediction of a single entity from the knowledge base, so mentions that should be linked with zero or multiple codes will not be predicted correctly. The validation set contains only 30 mentions which correspond to NO_CODE or multiple codes, accounting for approximately 3% of the validation set errors. • Missing entities in the KB cannot be predicted by the model. About 5.5% of the mentions in the validation set do not have a record in the validation KB for the same entity code.</p><p>A common error is suggesting an entity that is close to the target entity like a parent or entity term which has common (sub)-words, as shown in table <ref type="table" coords="13,346.36,165.03,8.53,10.91" target="#tab_11">12</ref>. For example, when the query is "somatometría (somatometry)", the system predicts the code for "medición de somatomedina (somatomedin measurement)" due to the common sub-word "somato". </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The proposed system shows satisfactory results on the named entity recognition, and entity linking subtasks of the MedProcNER challenge, exploring various approaches, with a focus on the impact of further pre-training and adapting on the performance of both monolingual (Spanish or English), and multilingual models. The system was evaluated on the test set and scored 0.71 F1 on the NER task and 0.53 F1 on the entity linking task. By comparison, the best system in the competition has shown an F1 score of 0.7985 on the NER task and 0.5707 on the entity linking task.</p><p>The conducted experiments suggest that further conditioning a specialized monolingual Spanish model via training on a focused dataset, such as one featuring gazetteer terms, leads to a stable performance improvement on the NER task. Large cross-lingual models proved to be an optimal choice for entity linking, achieving competitive results.</p><p>As further work, additional training data could be generated by replacing procedure mentions with synonyms. Also, introducing machine translation and alignment as a step in the NER pipeline could be beneficial, as it would allow utilizing state-of-the-art monolingual transformer models that are trained on English biomedical-clinical datasets. Last, but not least, it would be worth looking into alternative strategies for constructing entity mentions from token classification results, as the approach we employed, although simple, might be limiting in some cases (e.g. longer mentions). For the entity linking task further work can explore using the SapBERT XLMR-Large model to generate candidates and training a model to rank them. Also, exploring how to take advantage of the SNOMED-CT structure and entity relationships can be useful to provide additional information for linking.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,89.29,207.31,416.69,8.93;5,89.29,219.32,418.23,8.87;5,89.29,231.27,416.70,8.87;5,89.29,243.23,39.87,8.87;5,176.16,256.51,239.96,6.97;5,89.29,84.19,416.69,115.70"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: End-to-end architecture of the system -the preprocessed clinical case text is passed to a token classifier.

This is also the case when multiple separate mentions are listed as one, e.</figDesc><table coords="12,89.29,119.22,410.79,137.71"><row><cell>Model NER</cell><cell>Model EL</cell><cell>Test F1</cell><cell>Test F1</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>NER</cell><cell>EL</cell></row><row><cell>BioM-BERT-Large</cell><cell>SapBERT XLMR-Large</cell><cell>0.6769</cell><cell>0.5293</cell></row><row><cell>BioM-BERT-Large + Preprocessing</cell><cell>SapBERT XLMR-Large</cell><cell>0.6743</cell><cell>0.5216</cell></row><row><cell>CLIN-X-ES</cell><cell>SapBERT XLMR-Large</cell><cell>0.6981</cell><cell>0.5283</cell></row><row><cell>Pre-trained Spanish RoBERTa</cell><cell>SapBERT XLMR-Large</cell><cell>0.7154</cell><cell>0.5369</cell></row><row><cell>BioM-ALBERT Large + Adapter</cell><cell>SapBERT XLMR-Large</cell><cell>0.6580</cell><cell>0.51870</cell></row><row><cell>5.6.

'Mantoux, electrocardiograma (ECG), radiografía de tórax...

For example, in the sentence 'El paciente se intervino quirúrgicamente, realizándose una cistoprostatectomía radical con linfadenectomía más derivación tipo Indiana y cierre del defecto de pared abdominal con fascia lata.' our model predicts two separate mentions 'cistoprostatectomía radical' and 'linfadenectomía', instead of the truth -'cistoprostatectomía radical con linfadenectomía'. Overall, the model has a difficulty identifying long clinical procedure mentions, such as surgery descriptions. • Nested mentions are not identified -this is an inherent problem of the token classifier,</p></note></figure>
