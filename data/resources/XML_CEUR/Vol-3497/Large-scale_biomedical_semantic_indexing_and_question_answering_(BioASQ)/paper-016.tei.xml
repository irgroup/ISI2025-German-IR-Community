<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper discusses our submission to the 2023 BioASQ challenge, document retrieval subtask (subtask B, phase A). In the subtask, systems must return top 10 most relevant PubMed articles for each natural language query. Our multi-stage system incorporates a bi-encoder model in the retrieval stage, and a cross-encoder model at the reranking stage. At the retrieval stage, we use a hybrid retriever that combines dense and sparse retrieval, where the dense retrieval is implemented with the bi-encoder and the sparse retrieval is implemented with BM25. The bi-encoder and cross-encoder are initialized with PubMedBERT and further trained on PubMed query-article search logs of unprecedented scale, with about 255 million relevant query-article pairs. Each pair consists of a user query and a document clicked on by the user during their search on PubMed. Our system ranks second place in the second batch, and third place on the first and third batches at the 2023 BioASQ challenge, demonstrating the strength of models trained on PubMed search logs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Automatic question answering (QA) plays an important role in biomedical knowledge acquisition and clinical decision support <ref type="bibr" coords="1,219.71,459.98,11.43,9.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For many retrieval-augmented QA systems, the first stage is to retrieve relevant documents for the given question. The BioASQ Biomedical Semantic QA (Task 11B), particularly the document retrieval subtask (Phase A), provides a way to evaluate QA systems on datasets built by biomedical experts <ref type="bibr" coords="1,324.98,500.63,11.58,9.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We focus on the document retrieval aspect of the broader biomedical QA process. Lexical and semantic retrieval are two major approaches to textual information retrieval. Lexical retrieval is commonly implemented with sparse retrievers, while semantic retrieval is implemented with dense retrievers. Conventionally, document retrieval relied on sparse retrievers such as BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,356.69,554.82,11.32,9.74" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,370.72,554.82,7.54,9.74" target="#b3">4]</ref>, especially before the rise of transformer-based deep learning models <ref type="bibr" coords="1,266.81,568.37,11.28,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Sparse retrievers, by design, are capable of efficient lexical term matching but are weak at semantic matching due to the vocabulary mismatch problem <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.90,101.64,11.36,9.74" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.99,101.64,7.57,9.74" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>In this regard, the recent developments in dense retrieval led to great performance improvements over traditional sparse retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.06,128.74,11.37,9.74" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.16,128.74,7.58,9.74" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, dense retrievers have their drawbacks. Unlike sparse retrievers, dense retrievers often underperform on datasets that are outside the distributions of the training dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.62,155.84,16.14,9.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, requiring large amounts of data and compute to train, in addition to longer latency at inference time. Thus, term-based sparse retrieval still has a place in document retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,210.68,182.93,16.31,9.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.47,182.93,12.23,9.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>. A lexical retriever is much more cost-efficient and practical at scale, so it is still widely used for early retrieval stages. And while transformer architectures are good at capturing semantic meaning, they often struggle with lexical matching <ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.77,210.03,16.25,9.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Both lexical and semantic retrieval models have clear strengths and weaknesses. Building on this idea, one prominent research direction is incorporating different types of retrievers in an attempt to combine their strengths <ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.94,250.68,16.56,9.74" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,283.27,250.68,12.59,9.74" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,298.63,250.68,12.42,9.74" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In particular, combining sparse retrievers and BERT-based bi-encoders has achieved notable results <ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.96,264.23,16.35,9.74" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.05,264.23,12.26,9.74" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Especially for zero-shot and out-of-domain tasks, hybrid models that incorporate both dense and sparse retrieval outperform dense retriever models alone. In addition to the retrieval stage, multi-stage document retrieval systems have further reranking stages. Sparse retrievers and bi-encoders are often used for early-stage retrieval. For reranking, a popular reranking architecture is the cross-encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.43,318.43,16.19,9.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Cross-encoders generally outperform bi-encoders -albeit much slower during inferencemaking cross-encoders apt for reranking stages, where there are fewer candidate documents to rank <ref type="bibr" coords="2,112.56,359.07,11.43,9.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we present a multi-stage retrieval system, where the first stage retrieval uses a hybrid approach, consisting of a dense retriever and a sparse retriever. In the second stage, we rerank with a cross-encoder model. Our contribution is that we pre-train both the dense retriever and the cross-encoder reranker on large-scale PubMed search logs, which contain 255 million relevant article-article pairs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,251.62,426.82,18.03,9.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and have not been used by any prior work. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,501.09,426.82,5.14,9.74">1</ref> summarizes our overall architecture.</p><p>In the retrieval stage, we use BM25 and a bi-encoder. Since BM25 is a static model that is not trained with data, improving the dense retrieval component is essential to improving the hybrid retriever overall. The PubMed articles are processed into a Pyserini index <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.23,481.02,17.77,9.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and vector embeddings for sparse and dense retrieval, respectively. The hybrid retriever selects the top 1000 most relevant articles for each query. Then, the scores of the retrieved list are discarded and just the ranks are fed to the cross-encoder for the reranking stage. The reranker returns an updated top 1000 list. The top 10 of the list are submitted for the BioASQ challenge.</p><p>We evaluate our results both amongst different variants of our system (e.g., with differing hyperparameter values) and against other high-performing systems by participating in the 2023 BioASQ challenge, document retrieval task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.96,575.86,16.41,9.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. We place in the top 3 for the first and the third batches, and top 2 in the second batch, demonstrating the strength of our bi-encoder and cross-encoder, and thus the value of training models with user query-click logs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.75,602.96,16.43,9.74" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.91,602.96,12.55,9.74" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,478.18,602.96,12.32,9.74" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Hybrid Retrieval</head><p>Dataset We use query-article pairs from PubMed search logs to train the Bi-Encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.14,341.33,16.42,9.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Each unique query is associated with a list of articles. Each time a user searches for a query on PubMed and clicks on an article in their search results counts as a click count for that query-article pair. To build the training set, we start with raw PubMed search logs from 2020 to 2022. The raw logs consist of 168 million (M) unique queries and 24M unique articles. There are mulitple stages of filtering, including removing navigational queries. Articles that don't have a title or an abstract are also excluded. After preprocessing, the logs are reduced to 255M relevant query-article pairs, generated from 87M queries and 18M articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dense Retrieval with Bi-Encoder</head><p>To implement the dense retrieval portion of the hybrid retriever architecture, we use a bi-encoder model. The dense retriever (DR) is a bi-encoder comprised of a query encoder and a document encoder, both initialized with PubMedBERT-base weights <ref type="bibr" coords="3,127.53,505.58,16.42,9.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In a bi-encoder architecture, two independent encoders encode a query and a document <ref type="bibr" coords="3,137.47,519.13,16.56,9.74" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.92,519.13,12.42,9.74" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The relevance score is then the dot product of the two embeddings. The relevance scores are used to rank the most relevant documents.</p><p>DR is comprised of a query encoder (QEnc) and a document encoder (DEnc). They are both 12-layer transformer architectures and are implemented with Pytorch <ref type="bibr" coords="3,404.06,559.77,17.98,9.74" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Hugging Face Transformers library <ref type="bibr" coords="3,184.31,573.32,16.21,9.74" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Given a query 𝑞 and a document 𝑑, the relevance score is computed by: DR(𝑞, 𝑑) = QEnc(𝑞) 𝑇 DEnc(𝑑) ∈ ℝ QEnc and DEnc are as follows: Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,121.97,316.30,3.90,8.91">2</ref>: Overview of the hybrid retriever. The yellow boxes represent dense retrieval, and orange denotes sparse retrieval. The scores from each retriever is summed to generate a final score for each candidate document. The output of the hybrid retriever are the candidate documents, ranked by their final scores. We train our own bi-encoder for dense retrieval, and use BM25 for sparse retrieval. FAISS <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,364.12,16.34,8.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is used to perform nearest neighbor search for document and query embeddings, and Pyserini <ref type="bibr" coords="4,489.64,364.12,16.34,8.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is used to implement BM25.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,150.26,642.28,294.28,38.68">QEnc(𝑞) = Transformer([𝐶𝐿𝑆]𝑞[𝑆𝐸𝑃 ]) [CLS] ∈ ℝ 768 DEnc(𝑑) = Transformer([𝐶𝐿𝑆]𝑑 𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑒 [𝑆𝐸𝑃]𝑑 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡 [𝑆𝐸𝑃]) [CLS] ∈ ℝ 768</formula><p>Embeddings are taken from the last [CLS] hidden states. We use contrastive loss with inbatch negatives <ref type="bibr" coords="4,163.79,427.00,16.42,9.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. For a training instance containing a query 𝑞 and clicked document 𝑑, query-to-document loss 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑞2𝑑 (𝑞, 𝑑) and document-to-query loss 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑑2𝑞 (𝑞, 𝑑) are described by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,193.79,462.18,206.51,69.24">𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑞2𝑑 (𝑞, 𝑑) = -log exp(QEnc(𝑞) 𝑇 DEnc(𝑑)) ∑ 𝑖∈𝐵 exp(QEnc(𝑞)DEnc(𝑑 𝑖 )) 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑑2𝑞 (𝑞, 𝑑) = -log exp(QEnc(𝑞) 𝑇 DEnc(𝑑)) ∑ 𝑖∈𝐵 exp(QEnc(𝑞 𝑖 )DEnc(𝑑))</formula><p>where 𝐵 denotes all documents from the mini-batch except the input training instance.</p><p>Batch-level losses, 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 𝑞2𝑑 and 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 𝑑2𝑞 , are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,234.13,573.25,127.01,56.02">𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 𝑞2𝑑 = ∑ 𝑖∈𝐵 𝑊 𝑖 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑞2𝑑 (𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑑 𝑖 ) 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 𝑑2𝑞 = ∑ 𝑖∈𝐵 𝑊 𝑖 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝑑2𝑞 (𝑞 𝑖 , 𝑑 𝑖 )</formula><p>where 𝑊 𝑖 is a parameter that gives higher weight to instances with more clicks. The final loss 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 for the mini-batch is then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,224.64,667.77,138.69,15.54">𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 = 𝛼𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵 𝑞2𝑑 + (1 -𝛼)𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 𝐵</formula><p>where 𝛼 is a trained hyper-parameter. We optimize parameters in QEnc and DEnc end-to-end by gradient-based optimizers. The models use the Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,387.96,101.64,17.90,9.74" target="#b31">[32]</ref> without weight decay, with learning rate of 2e-5 and epsilon 1e-8. We encode all queries and documents using QEnc and DEnc, respectively. We use the FAISS library to build an index and perform nearest N search <ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.29,142.29,16.36,9.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The query and document embeddings are added to a FlatIP FAISS index, and maximum inner-product search is used to generate the a list of 1000 most relevant documents for each query.</p><p>Sparse Retrieval with BM25 Sparse retrievers such as BM25 continue to be quite useful despite the recent rise of dense retrieval methods <ref type="bibr" coords="5,302.75,211.69,16.10,9.74" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. BM25 frequently serves as a nice baseline, but it can also be used to complement dense retrievers' weaknesses, such as lexical matching.</p><p>We use the Pyserini library to implement BM25 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,303.22,238.79,17.91,9.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</p><p>Hybrid Retriever Our retriever combines results from the dense retriever and the sparse retriever. The document scores returned by the retrievers are normalized with L1 norm. A hyperparameter 𝜆 controls the weight of the BM25 scores in the final summed scores:</p><p>Score(𝑞, 𝑑) = S 𝑑𝑟 (𝑞, 𝑑) + 𝜆 S 𝑠𝑟 (𝑞, 𝑑) where Score(𝑞, 𝑑) is the final hybrid retrieval score for some query 𝑞 and some document 𝑑, S 𝑑𝑟 the L1-normed score from the dense retriever, and S 𝑠𝑟 (𝑞, 𝑑) the L1-normed score from the sparse retriever. The final output list of the hybrid retriever for some query is simply the top 1000 relevant documents, ranked by the above summed scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Reranking with Cross-Encoder</head><p>The top 1000 list returned by the hybrid retriever is then reranked by our cross-encoder model. Unlike the bi-encoder, a single cross-encoder model (CrossEnc) is fed both the query and document, and predicts their relevance directly, without having to use nearest neighbors search. CrossEnc, like QEnc and DEnc, is initialized with PubMedBERT weights <ref type="bibr" coords="5,464.59,481.69,16.42,9.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and implemented with Pytorch <ref type="bibr" coords="5,212.21,495.24,17.98,9.74" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Hugging Face Transformers libraries <ref type="bibr" coords="5,419.97,495.24,16.33,9.74" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.

Unlike QEnc and DEnc, which are trained with in-batch negatives, CrossEnc uses local negatives <ref type="bibr" coords="5,175.90,612.00,16.09,9.74" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. For a training instance with a query 𝑞 and a relevant (clicked) document 𝑑, the negative log-likelihood loss is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="5,149.40,648.07,295.29,27.87">𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠(𝑞, 𝑑) = -log exp(CrossEnc(𝑞, 𝑑)) exp(CrossEnc(𝑞, 𝑑)) + ∑ 𝑗∈𝑀 exp(CrossEnc(𝑞, 𝑑 𝑗 ))</formula><p>where 𝑀 is a list of documents that are irrelevant (not clicked).</p><p>We pre-train the CrossEnc on PubMed search log data, and further train using the training set provided by BioASQ, which consist of over 4000 queries <ref type="bibr" coords="6,362.17,115.19,16.42,9.74" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. As for inference, we apply CrossEnc to every document in the list returned by the hybrid retriever for each test query, and the list of documents ranked by CrossEnc scores is the reranked list. Each team can submit up to 5 systems for official evaluation. For submission, we use two different versions of CrossEnc -one at 1200 optimization steps, and another at 1800.</p></div>

For example, Ranker3 starts with the list returned by the hybrid retriever with lambda value of 1.25, and reranks with the cross-encoder checkpoint at 1800 steps.</p></div>

Steps are optimization steps at which the checkpoint of the cross-encoder was saved. Retrievers 1 and 2 are retriever only, while Rerankers 1-5 use both retriever and reranker. For example, Reranker3 takes the results from Retriever2, and reranks with the cross-encoder checkpoint at 1800 steps. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Official BioASQ Evaluation</head><p>Teams can submit up to 5 systems for official evaluation in the challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="7,413.33,108.66,11.39,9.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,458.84,108.66,5.05,9.74">2</ref> indicates which 5 systems we use for each batch. Retriever2 outperforms Retriever1 in batch 1, but Retriever1 outperforms Retriever2 in batch 2 by 66%. Retriever2 scores 0.3401 in batch 1 but 0.1725 in batch 2. The performance differences both among the two retrievers and among the first two batches is quite large. There is high variance amongst the batches which highly influences the two retrievers' performance, considering that there's only a 0.25 𝜆 𝐵𝑀25 difference between them. Nevertheless, it is clear that the rerankers consistently outperform the retrieveronly systems. For example, the best reranker outperforms the best retriever by 29% and 30% on batches 1 and 2 respectively, which demonstrates the strength of our cross-encoder trained on PubMed search logs. And accordingly, we no longer submit retriever-only systems for batch 3. Rerankers 1, 3, and 5 are reranked with cross-encoder checkpoint at 1800 steps, but Reranker1 and Reranker3 outperform Reranker5 by 24%. The only difference is that Reranker5 has a significantly lower 𝜆 𝐵𝑀25 of 0.6, as opposed to 1 or 1.25, showing that the hyperparameter weight of the sparse retriever versus dense retriever in the hybrid retriever can have a large impact. We use two different versions of the reranker (1200 and 1800) in an attempt to capture different aspects of the test data, which is only somewhat successful. In batch 1, Reranker1 and Reranker2 have the same MAP score despite using different versions of the cross-encoder.</p><p>In batch 3, Reranker2 and Reranker4, which use the 1200 version, outperform Reranker1 and Reranker3, which use the 1800 version, by about 1%. In comparison with other top teams, our systems fare pretty well. In batch 1, our top system scores 0.4404, comparable to the top score of 0.4590. In batch 2, the top system outperforms our best system by 3%. We again rank top 3 in batch 3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Further Analysis</head><p>We randomly select about 200 queries from the BioASQ training dataset to form a development set <ref type="bibr" coords="8,104.64,122.21,16.29,9.74" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. We perform ablation experiments on the development set to further test the merit of our design choices. The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,349.70,135.76,3.81,9.74">3</ref>. We evaluate the systems on the development set with three metrics: mean average precision (MAP), recall at 10 (R@10), and recall at 1000 (R@1k). We test BM25 (sparse retrieval only), Bi-Encoder (dense retrieval only), Hybrid Retriever, Reranker, and systems that combine the normed scores from Reranker and the previous 3 systems (i.e. BM25, Bi-Encoder, Hybrid Retriever). The plus sign in table <ref type="table" coords="8,459.14,189.95,5.01,9.74">3</ref> indicates that the normed scores from the "operand" systems were summed to generate the final score for the system. The trends show the relative strengths of BM25 and BERT-based models. BM25 and Reranker2 + BM25 show strong performance for R@1k, perhaps showing that sparse retrieval is effective at recall but not as strong in precision, especially for low ranks. Hybrid Retriever outperforms BM25 and Bi-Encoder in MAP and R@10, justifying the case for hybrid retrieval. And although Bi-Encoder on its own performs poorly, it still improves retrieval when incorporated. In addition, Reranker outperforms Hybrid Retriever, confirming the importance of reranking and justifying the need for multi-stage systems. Finally, we test the possibility that reranking, similar to retrieval, also benefits from hybrid models -i.e. that the reranker might gain from augmentation with either BM25, Bi-Encoder, or Hybrid Retriever. The experiments show that our cross-encoder reranker is just as effective or better on its own as it is when comibined with another retriever into a "hybrid" version, with the exception of Reranker + BM25 in R@1k, which further confirms the aforementioned strength of BM25 in recall. Overall, our internal evaluations further demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid retrieval and multi-stage ranking systems.</p></div>
