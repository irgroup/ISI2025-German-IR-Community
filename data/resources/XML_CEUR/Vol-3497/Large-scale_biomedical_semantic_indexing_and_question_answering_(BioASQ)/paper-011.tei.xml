<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Biomedical question answering (QA) is a pivotal tool, empowering researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients to access accurate, up-to-date information from the vast pool of biomedical knowledge in the literature. The BioASQ challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="1,365.14,490.37,12.69,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has actively fostered collaborative efforts across the scientific community to push the boundaries of cutting-edge biomedical QA research for over a decade. Yoon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,275.16,517.46,12.70,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> made a significant contribution to the biomedical QA field by utilizing the pre-trained model BioBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,320.82,531.01,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, instead of traditional word embedding models, in their milestone study. This approach has paved the way for numerous other systems and approaches in this field.</p><p>In this paper, we explore understudied or recently proposed pre-processing techniques, new pre-trained models, training objectives, data augmentation, and ensemble approaches in the BioASQ Task 11b <ref type="bibr" coords="2,189.66,114.06,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We first revisit existing pre-processing methods to analyze what type of question each method is suitable for. We use BioLinkBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.74,127.61,13.00,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as a new embedding model in the BioASQ challenge and show that it outperforms existing language models such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,230.31,154.71,11.55,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We adopt a sequence tagging approach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.13,154.71,11.46,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.32,154.71,9.02,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref> to train listtype QA models, which is the first attempt in the challenge. In addition, we investigate the potential performance improvement in BioASQ by employing data augmentation techniques using SQuAD <ref type="bibr" coords="2,155.05,195.36,11.59,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a human-labeled factoid dataset consisting of Wikipedia documents, and LIQUID <ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.38,208.91,16.40,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, an automated framework that generates list-type questions and corresponding answers from PubMed abstracts. We examine whether the utilization of an ensemble method can further optimize the performance. Finally, we evaluate the capability of the state-of-the-art pre-trained model, GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.37,249.56,16.25,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, on the list-type questions in a one-shot manner.</p><p>We selected the best combination of approaches from pre-processing to the use of GPT-4, through experiments on the BioASQ-10b dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,308.98,276.66,17.96,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for each question type. We participated in the BioASQ Task 11b-Phase B <ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.90,290.20,17.96,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> to evaluate our systems on the official leaderboard. Our systems delivered remarkable performance across various question types, leading to impressive rankings. In the yes/no type, our systems achieved first place across all four batches, while in the factoid type, we attained the highest rank in one out of four batches. Additionally, we secured the highest rank in two out of four batches for the list type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task Description</head><p>In BioASQ 11B-phase b <ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.10,403.03,16.08,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, models are required to provide answers to a given question, denoted as 𝑞. These answers are inferred from a collection of snippets, represented as 𝑠 1 , . . . , 𝑠 𝐽 , which are extracted from PubMed abstracts. The format of answers depends on the question types. For this year's competition, we focused only on the following three question types that require exact answers, excluding questions requiring ideal answers.</p><p>Yes/no. For this type of question, the model should answer "yes" or "no" to a question based on the given snippets. An example question of this type is: "Is capmatinib effective for glioblastoma?" Answering yes/no questions often requires considering multiple snippets collectively rather than relying on a single snippet alone.</p><p>Factoid. Factoid-type questions are mainly concerned with the confirmation or summarization of factual information and require a single concise answer (e.g., "Which enzyme does Opicapone inhibit?"). The ground-truth answers are usually, but not always, contained in the snippets, which distinguishes it from other QA tasks such as SQuAD, where answers always can be extracted in a given context <ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.66,609.59,11.43,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>List. The list type requires more than one answer to a single question. An example question is: "What laboratory abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with COVID-19?" Although list-type questions have received less attention in academic research compared to factoidtype questions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,157.65,100.52,16.34,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, they are frequently encountered in practice, especially in the biomedical domain <ref type="bibr" coords="3,126.02,114.06,11.54,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Similar to the factoid type, answers may or may not be extracted from the given snippets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>Our system comprises three models, each specifically designed for a particular question type. To identify the optimal choices for each question, we explore five factors to consider in effectively addressing different types of questions: pre-processing techniques (Section 3.1), QA model selection (Section 3.2), training objectives (Section 3.3), data augmentation approaches (Section 3.4), and the use of ensemble methods (Section 3.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Pre-processing</head><p>Given that the total length of all 𝐽 snippets might exceed the input length limit of language models, it becomes necessary to select which snippets from the given set should be provided to the model as input. We examine two pre-processing techniques: the "single snippet" method and the "full snippet" method.</p><p>Single snippet. One straightforward approach is to treat each snippet as an individual instance, resulting in multiple question-snippet pairs as follows: (𝑞, 𝑠 1 ), . . . , (𝑞, 𝑠 𝐽 ). For the factoid and list types, only snippets that contain at least one answer string are utilized as training instances. On the other hand, all snippets are used for training for the yes/no type. Although this approach has been commonly used in previous studies because of its simplicity, treating each snippet as a separate instance can be sub-optimal, particularly for the yes/no type. In answering yes/no questions, it is often necessary that multiple snippets are considered collectively and the information present in one snippet should be considered in conjunction with other pieces of information available in other snippets. Furthermore, this method disregards the opportunity to extract valuable information from other snippets that could potentially aid in predicting correct answers.</p><p>Full snippet. The full-snippet method addresses the limitations of the single-snippet approach by concatenating all snippets together to form a single comprehensive evidence context. In cases where the question-context pair exceeds the input length limitation imposed by the language model, the set of given snippets is partitioned into multiple contexts based on sentence boundaries. In other words, each context is created by concatenating the maximum number of snippets, ensuring that the length limit is not exceeded. Separate contexts created in this manner are then treated as individual instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">QA Model</head><p>BioLinkBERT. BioLinkBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,229.75,654.84,12.69,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is a pre-trained language model trained on PubMed abstracts using a new pre-training objective called document relation prediction, where the model predicts whether two different segments are linked,<ref type="foot" coords="4,284.93,85.21,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> come from a single document, or are randomly selected from different documents. The model outperformed existing biomedical language models such as PubMedBERT in various downstream tasks. Especially the model achieved an accuracy of 94.8 on yes/no questions in a previous BioASQ challenge dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="4,432.57,127.61,16.25,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Inspired by this result, we used a BioLinkBERT-large model as our backbone model. For a given question 𝑞 and context 𝑐 that consists of one or multiple snippets, the corresponding token representations are encoded as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,176.93,192.77,325.85,12.32">[h [CLS] , h 𝑞 1 , . . . , h 𝑞 𝑇 , h [SEP] , h 𝑐 1 , . . . , h 𝑐 𝐿 ] = 𝐸(𝑞, 𝑐), (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,502.78,192.77,3.86,10.91">)</formula><p>where 𝐸 is the BioLinkBERT encoder, h [CLS] ∈ R 𝑑 and h [SEP] ∈ R 𝑑 are the representations of special tokens <ref type="bibr" coords="4,167.97,230.83,16.41,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and 𝑇 and 𝐿 are the lengths of the question and context, respectively. The token representations are then fed into task-specific layers, which will be described in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GPT-4.</head><p>Recently, foundation models such as ChatGPT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,336.81,286.68,17.76,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,406.20,286.68,17.76,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> have been utilized in various downstream applications. Notably, they have demonstrated comparable or even superior performance compared to supervised models without fine-tuning. These findings serve as compelling evidence that the models possess the capability to deliver accurate answers to questions even in specialized domains such as biomedicine. In this challenge, we selected Open AI's latest model, GPT-4, as our QA system. <ref type="foot" coords="4,280.64,352.68,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> Unlike BioLinkBERT, GPT-4 is a black-box model; thus, we cannot access the hidden representation to update the model, and we should query the model using instructions <ref type="bibr" coords="4,199.91,381.53,16.09,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. We used only a single labeled example to provide the model with more comprehensive information on the task and desired output format (see Table <ref type="table" coords="4,467.38,395.08,5.17,10.91">1</ref> for the input prompt we used).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Training Objective</head><p>Binary classification. For the yes/no type, the model is trained using a binary classification objective, where the final hidden representation of the [CLS] token, h [CLS] , is fed to a linear layer. The loss is defined as the sum of the negative log probabilities of the true answer class (i.e., yes or no).</p><p>Span prediction. For the factoid type, the token representations of the context are fed into two different linear layers that calculate logit values for the start and end positions of the answer span as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,89.29,553.10,416.69,28.86">𝑧 start 𝑐 1 , . . . , 𝑧 start 𝑐 𝐿 = [w ⊤ start h 𝑐 1 , . . . , w ⊤ start h 𝑐 𝐿 ], 𝑧 end 𝑐 1 , . . . , 𝑧 end 𝑐 𝐿 = [w ⊤ end h 𝑐 1 , . . . , w ⊤ end h 𝑐 𝐿 ]</formula><p>. These logits are used to calculate probability values for each token, indicating the likelihood of it being the start or end of the answer span. The loss is calculated by summing the negative log probabilities of the start and end positions of the ground-truth answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>The designed prompt for GPT-4 to answer list-type questions. {Test Question} and {Test Context} are substituted by real questions and contexts in test batches.</p><p>Your task is to identify a list of answers to the question in the provided context. To help you understand the task, here is an example: Question: Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis? Context: Pyridostigmine and neostygmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used as first-line therapy for symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answer: neostigmine, pyridostigmine</head><p>Now, here is the actual question and context for you to find the appropriate list of answers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Question: {Test Question}</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context: {Test Context}</head><p>Answer:</p><p>Sequence tagging. One conventional approach to solving list-type QA involves considering the top answer predictions of a single-span QA model that surpasses a pre-defined threshold as final predictions. Recent studies <ref type="bibr" coords="5,230.08,447.79,11.23,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,243.63,447.79,8.88,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref> have proposed an alternative approach, treating list QA as a sequence tagging problem, where the model classifies each context token into B (beginning), I (inside), or O (outside) tags, similar to named entity recognition. This approach showed better performance in list QA than existing single-span QA models in a range of general and biomedical QA datasets <ref type="bibr" coords="5,145.47,501.99,16.43,10.91" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,164.62,501.99,12.33,10.91" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Inspired by these results, we adopted this approach to train our list-type QA model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Data Augmentation</head><p>We explored two data augmentation approaches to enhance performance in the factoid and list types. <ref type="foot" coords="5,118.81,577.06,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref>SQuAD. For the factoid type, we followed previous studies that leveraged a large-scale singlespan dataset SQuAD <ref type="bibr" coords="5,181.15,621.12,11.23,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,194.81,621.12,12.50,10.91" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,209.73,621.12,12.50,10.91" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,224.66,621.12,12.23,10.91" target="#b23">24]</ref>. While the SQuAD dataset is not specifically designed for the GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,258.33,382.73,16.46,8.87" target="#b10">[11]</ref> biomedical domain, it shares a fundamental similarity with the factoid-type QA in BioASQ. Both datasets aim to find accurate answers to factual questions within a provided text.

We use a probability-based ensemble method for factoid-type questions. In this approach, we calculate the sum of probability values for each of the top 20 answers predicted List. We counted the number of answers predicted by single models to a given question based on their string form. For each answer, we calculated an ensemble score as the proportion of how many models out of the total number of models predicted the answer. For instance, suppose that model A, model B, and model C predict {"leprosy, " "cirrhosis, " "cholera"}, {"leprosy, " "COVID-19"}, and {"cirrhosis"}, respectively, then the ensemble scores of each prediction as follows: leprosy (2/3), cirrhosis (2/3), cholera (1/3), and COVID-19 (1/3). If the score is higher than the threshold, we included the predicted answer in the final answer set; otherwise, we excluded it. We searched for the best threshold value using the BioASQ 10b dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Official Evaluation on BioASQ-11b</head><p>Tables 4, 5, and 6 show that our best models achieved top scores in many batches. Especially, in the yes/no type, our models achieved the highest scores across all batches, to with full-snippet method contribute significantly. In the factoid type, we achieved the highest score in the last batch. Our factoid QA models basically used a similar model structure and training method, but their performance and rankings were very different from batch to batch. This is because we continuously searched for best single models by randomly initializing them, making us to obtain better single models in batches 3 and 4. In addition, we found that the performance of ensemble models depended on the individual performance of single models rather than the quantity of single models. For instance, by ensembling a small number of high-performing models, we were able to achieve second and first place in batches 3 and 4, respectively.</p><p>In the list type, we achieved first place in two batches using supervised model and GPT-4, respectively. For the supervised model, the full-snippet method, data augmentation using LIQUID, and ensemble were all effective to improve the performance (see Section 5.2 for more results). GPT-4 outperformed our supervised models in batch 4 and achieved the best performance. This is very surprising because our supervised models were ensemble models of several single models trained using thousands of human-labeled BioASQ data and 140k artificial QA data, while GPT-4 used only a single question-answer pair.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="6,88.99,90.49,418.52,46.47"><head>Table 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Statistics of the BioASQ-10b (the training and validation sets) and BioASQ-11b (the test batches) datasets.</figDesc><table coords="6,138.15,122.05,228.18,14.90"><row><cell>Type</cell><cell>Number of Questions</cell></row></table></figure>

In addition, the LIQUID data significantly improved the model performance on the list type, which is consistent with Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,242.53,248.44,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This study focused on conducting comprehensive experiments, encompassing a range of preprocessing techniques and the utilization of advanced models such as BioLinkBERT and GPT-4.</p><p>In addition, we delved into the exploration of data augmentation and ensemble methods, further refining the performance of our QA system. Our models achieved high performance in BioASQ task 11b -phase B. We hope that our findings and analysis will contribute towards enhancing the performance of biomedical QA systems, ultimately maximizing knowledge discovery and information retrieval efficiency.</p></div>			</div>
