<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses two tasks aimed at enhancing language comprehension. First, we address the problem of identifying complexity in the text. This task consists of two parts: identifying complex terms and explaining them. To accomplish this task, we used a variety of methods. Different approaches are compared using both manual and automated evaluation. The second task deals with text simplification. GPT, Bloom and Simple T5 are compared on a variety of automated metrics. After analyzing performance of different models, we concluded that it is possible to achieve decent results with most of the methods, even when the free and trial versions of the products are used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Understanding and going through a lot of scientific literature is often crucial in domain understanding and quality research. However, understanding scientific texts can be a challenging task. They are often dense, and the researchers are usually not able to keep up, especially in the era where most of the research is interdisciplinary.</p><p>In this paper, we address two interconnected tasks aimed at solving this problem <ref type="bibr" coords="1,443.37,480.92,28.01,9.74">[1] [2]</ref>. Task 2 focuses on the identification and explanation of difficult concepts, aiming to help understanding specialized terminology and technical jargon. By automatically identifying difficult words, deciphering abbreviations, and explaining them in context, this project tries to help researchers understand scientific jargon that falls out of their area of expertise.</p><p>Task 3, on the other hand, revolves around the rewriting of scientific text to simplify complex information. Using natural language processing and machine learning, we hope to simplify passages from scientific abstracts in order to help identify the relevant articles and keep up with the ever-growing library of knowledge accessible through the Internet.</p><p>The outcomes of our research have numerous implications across various domains. By improving language comprehension, we can enhance education and learning experiences, enable more effective information retrieval, and contribute to the standardization of terminology. Moreover, our work holds significance for natural language processing applications such as machine translation and question-answering systems, where accurate understanding and explanation of difficult terms are critical.</p><p>In the subsequent sections of this paper, we delve into the methodologies employed for both Task 2 and Task 3. We present our dataset, describe the techniques utilized, and provide experimental results and evaluations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Field Overview</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Complexity Spotting</head><p>There are different approaches to complexity spotting. Some of the more popular ones are listed below:</p><p>Linguistic Features Approach: Traditional approaches use linguistic features to determine text complexity. These features include word length, sentence length, syntactic complexity (e.g., number of clauses), lexical diversity, and readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid readability score) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.08,343.82,12.40,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or support vector machines, can be trained on labeled datasets using these features to predict text complexity. Domain-Specific Features Approach: Scientific texts often have domain-specific characteristics that contribute to their complexity. These features can be identified using rule-based or statistical methods. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.49,398.02,12.84,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Corpus-Based Approaches: Corpus-based methods use large-scale text corpora to analyze and model text complexity. These approaches usually measure the frequency and distribution of complex linguistic patterns. They often use statistical models and clustering to predict complexity. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,139.65,452.22,13.73,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Neural Networks Approach: Deep learning models: recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers can be trained on labeled datasets to use linguistic and contextual features to predict complexity. They have shown very good results as they can assess the difficulty of the terms in context.</p><p>Previously mentioned methods are further explained in this review article. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.32,519.96,12.84,9.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Ensemble Approaches: Ensemble methods combine multiple models or techniques to improve prediction accuracy.</p><p>Cross-Domain Transfer Learning Approach: Transfer learning techniques, such as pre-trained language models like BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.40,574.16,16.11,9.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or GPT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.36,574.16,14.80,9.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, are by far the most popular approach nowadays. They have been trained on large amounts of data and can be used to accomplish almost any NLP task. They show the best results with a bit of fine-tuning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Text Simplification</head><p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.85,650.98,14.80,9.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: Models trained on parallel corpora consisting of complex and simplified sentences. They learn to generate simplified versions of input sentences by leveraging the alignment between the two languages.</p><p>Seq2Seq Models with Attention Mechanism <ref type="bibr" coords="3,293.29,101.64,20.89,9.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>: Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models equipped with attention mechanisms capture dependencies between words in the source sentence and generate simplified output sentences more accurately.</p><p>Transformer Models: Transformer-based architectures, such as the Transformer model introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper <ref type="bibr" coords="3,310.18,155.84,17.97,9.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, have been applied to text simplification tasks. These models use self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual information and generate simplified sentences.</p><p>Rule-Based Approaches: Rule-based methods incorporate predefined simplification rules and patterns to transform complex text. These rules can be based on linguistic principles or domain-specific guidelines. Rule-based approaches are often used in combination with other methods to enhance the performance of the simplification models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Description</head><p>Data used for tasks was sent to us by CLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="3,276.38,295.76,15.74,9.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as a part of our shared tasks. Data was different for each of the tasks, and it consisted of 3 test sets: small, medium and large. The small dataset is included in the medium one, while the latter is included in the large one.</p><p>For the first task, train data consists of 2 documents. The first is the Citation Network Dataset. The second is Qrels. This file extends the qrels released with a significant increase of the depth of judgments of abstracts per query. Relevance annotations are provided on a 0-2 scale (the higher, the more relevant) for 29 queries associated with the first 15 articles from the Guardian, totalling 203 examples. The test data consisted of 152072 for large dataset, for medium dataset 4797, and 2234 for small dataset.</p><p>For the third task, train data is a parallel corpus of 648 manually simplified sentences. Test data consists of 152072 in large dataset, 4976 in medium dataset, and 2413 in small dataset.</p></div>

Since there are not a lot of papers written on this topic, we decided to use methods used for keyword extraction as there is a strong correlation between keywords and difficult words in the sentences. It is important to note that the definition of difficult words was not provided, so we had to work on what seemed to be logical for us. For us, difficulty often meant scientific jargon and domain specific terms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>This project was done as a collaboration between two students as a part of Erasmus+ Blended Intensive Program. Both of us are fairly new in the field of Natural Language Processing and due to equipment limitations we couldn't implement any of the more complex models. We were using our own laptops and the free version of Google Collaboratory environment, which limits the data allocation and session duration for its users. We used a free version of the models and had to keep track of tokens in order to complete all the tasks, and thus we decided to use a reduced number of examples to work with BLOOM and GPT. Keeping that in mind, we tried to represent as many different approaches so, our project would give a good comparison for models that can be implemented with limited resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Difficult words identification and scoring</head><p>For these tasks, our results were scored by selecting a smaller subset of all submitted difficult terms. Afterward the selected terms were scored on three metrics: number of ok terms, number of correctly scored terms and number of terms that satisfy both criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1.">Number of ok terms</head><p>Number of correct terms reflect how many terms are correctly identified as difficult.</p><p>As a team, for this task we submitted 10 runs using a combination of methods. Number of extracted, evaluated and ok terms are shown in a table below. As is visible from the table above different methods returned different number of words so, it is best to take into the account how many of the actual terms were ok. The relation between number of extracted and correct terms is shown below.  A lot of the methods achieved good results. Bloom had the worst results and Simple T5 had the best, scoring 90%. This is somewhat surprising as we expected Bloom to achieve better results. However, this could also be explained with the number of total terms that we submitted, which were only 100 for Bloom and way more for other methods (1109 for keyBERT). The reason for this was the token limitation that forced us to use less examples with Bloom. Since there were fewer examples to evaluate, it seems like none of the examples matched the ones provided by Bloom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.2.">Number of correctly scored terms</head><p>The number of correctly scored terms reflects if the complexity of the term is adequately labeled.</p><p>Scoring the terms proved a bit more challenging as it was dependent on the results of the previous task.</p><p>As is shown in the table below, scoring was quite poor across all methods. This is probably due to the fact that the train set consisted of only 203 examples and didn't include any examples of class 0. The Task description stated that participants should score terms "... on a scale 0-2 (2 to be the most difficult terms, while the meaning of terms scored 0 can be derived or guessed)" so we had to adjust the scores to reflect a different scoring system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3.">Correct LIMITS &amp; Correct difficulty scores</head><p>Correct LIMITS &amp; Correct difficulty scores reflects how many terms satisfy both criteria.  All the methods required manual intervention, which could be another source of error. Our scores were adjusted by looking at the output of each of the methods and manually deciding on where to draw a line of most difficult terms.</p><p>The best results were achieved using Flesch Reading Ease formula paired with RAKE and YAKE extraction methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Difficult Term Explanation</head><p>For this task our results were calculated using a combination of BLEU <ref type="bibr" coords="9,409.44,625.36,16.41,9.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, ROUGE <ref type="bibr" coords="9,462.59,625.36,23.82,9.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and matching scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.">Matching scores</head><p>Matching scores are scores that evaluate how many definitions are exactly, partially or semantically equivalent to target definitions. Terms that were identified in the previous tasks were explained in this task using a variety of methods. The following figure shows the number of evaluated explanations that semantically matched target definitions. This task was done on 3 sets of data. Smaller subset of test set, extended version of the test set and non-unique words that also appeared in the train data set.  Most of the methods performed really good on the smaller dataset, achieving a semantic match in most cases. Runs containing Simple T5 proved to be the best method, scoring around 70%. Wiki generally scored better than other methods, excluding SimpleT5, due to the large database it has the access to. All the methods showed the best results with single word terms.</p><p>Blooms variant Bloomz performed the worst with a score of 0, which can be explained with the fact that the Bloom run used only 100 examples due to token restrictions.</p><p>When the tests were repeated with the extended dataset, all of their results improved. The biggest improvement was with Bloomz model that achieved 71% on this test and 0% on the reduced dataset. Simple T5 remained as the best model with 73% semantic match. Runs and their semantic match percentages are shown in the table below. However, since the number of evaluated terms differed significantly, it is also beneficial to take into the account the number of evaluated terms. Even though the semantic match percentage was lower for methods like TextRank + Wiki, the number of semantically matched definition was higher. In both datasets, smaller and larger, extended dataset methods using Word Net were consistently shown as the worst performers. The last dataset on which the examples were evaluated consisted of non-unique words that appeared in the train dataset. Percentages for this dataset mostly followed the ones that were achieved on the extended dataset. With the largest deviation at around 5%. Methods are shown with their semantic matched for all three cases in the figure below. Other than overall definition matching, models also assessed on their performance in abbreviation extension. In this aspect, Bloomz performed the best with a score of 61% semantic match. All runs using Wiki performed similarly, scoring around 10%. This was somewhat expected as abbreviations could have different meaning based on the context and Wikipedia can not decipher which one is correct. More powerful models as Bloomz are scoring better as they are trained to pay attention to the context of the term. The only model that had any exact or partial matches was Simple T5. It had 7 exact and 8 partial matches. All the results are shown in the table below.  </p></div>

In this task, reference sentences represent the correct explanations for extracted difficult terms. ROUGE score is a set of metric that compared the generated text to reference sentences. For this task 3 values contained in the set were used. Precision is a metric that calculates how close are the predicted definitions to the true definitions. Recall is the metric that calculates the proportion of the correct words used in predicted definitions. Fmeasure is a metric calculated when recall and precision are combined in one metric.  Sentences mostly differed from the reference sentences, which is evident for both BLEU and ROUGE scores. On both scores the combination of SimpleT5 and Wiki scored the highest while the rest of the methods scored similarly low.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>In this report we have explained our approach for identifying, scoring and explaining difficult words. We have also shown 3 different approaches in simplifying whole sentences. We have submitted 10 runs for difficult term identification and scoring, 10 runs for term explanation and 3 for sentence simplification. We used a combination of models for each task, combining using prompts and training.</p><p>Furthermore, we compared the results obtained with all these methods and concluded that it is possible to achieve decent results with some of the methods, mainly Simple T5, which proved to be the best method overall. Still, there is room for improvement. Since our runs were not evaluated by us students, but by the teacher, we couldn't provide deeper understanding of some of the results. It would be beneficial for us to gain insight into how our results were evaluated and which terms were, for example, the most difficult for each of the methods to score. We think that this could be one of topic of future research.</p><p>Another topic that presented itself was, how appropriate was it to use automated metrics to score definitions. This is a topic that could be very interesting to explore since, in our research, semantic matches and automated metrics were scoring models very differently.</p><p>In the end, even though we only used free to use programs and our own equipment we achieved pretty good results, proving that NLP tasks are not only for GPT and can be attempted by anyone.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,89.29,357.52,321.41,8.91;8,151.80,84.19,291.69,260.81"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Relationship between the number of all evaluated and correct terms</figDesc><graphic coords="8,151.80,84.19,291.69,260.81" type="bitmap" /></figure>
