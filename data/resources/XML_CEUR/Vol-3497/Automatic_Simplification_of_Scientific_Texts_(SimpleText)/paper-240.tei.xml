<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The advent of digitization and open access has facilitated the accessibility of scientific literature to the general public. While this represents a significant milestone, there are still numerous obstacles hindering non-experts from obtaining unbiased scientific information from these texts. Specifically, scientific literature can be challenging to comprehend due to its reliance on specialized knowledge and the use of complex terminology.</p><p>Despite recent attempts at text simplification (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,328.60,484.19,12.23,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) to address this issue, the automatic removal of comprehension barriers between scientific texts and the general public remains an ongoing challenge. The paper highlights that even the most advanced language models currently available face difficulties when it comes to simplifying scientific texts. The described results demonstrate the limitations of these models in effectively tackling the task of simplification in the scientific domain.</p><p>The CLEF 2023 SimpleText track brings together researchers and practitioners working on the generation of simplified summaries of scientific texts. It is an evaluation lab that follows up on the CLEF 2021 SimpleText Workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="1,274.99,592.58,12.99,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and CLEF 2022 SimpleText Track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,443.56,592.58,11.59,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The track</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CLEF 2023 SimpleText Task 3 Test Collection</head><p>The main objective of this task is to generate simplified versions of sentences taken from scientific abstracts. To assess the performance of participants, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted using various automatic measures such as SARI, ROUGE, compression, and readability. Additionally, a smaller-scale, but more detailed, human evaluation was carried out to assess other aspects of the simplifications, including the presence of information distortion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data</head><p>Similar to the previous year, a parallel corpus comprising 648 manually simplified sentences was provided as training data for the participants <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.51,542.82,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>To ensure a certain level of overlap in the partial runs submitted by participants, three test sets were provided: small, medium, and large. The expectation was that participants would opt to use LLMs, which could result in the generation of partial runs due to the efficiency constraints associated with these models. By offering different test sets, we aimed to account for the varying computational limitations and facilitate the participation of a wide range of approaches, including those leveraging LLMs.</p><p>The small dataset was included in the medium one, while the latter is included in the large one. By evaluating the systems on the small test sets, it helped ensure that there would be some common ground among the partial runs generated by different participants. This approach facilitated the comparison and analysis of the system outputs, even though they were based on different test sets.</p><p>The small dataset included the train data, which facilitates the comparison of system performance on both the training and testing data. Including the train data in the small dataset enables the evaluation of how well the systems generalize to unseen test data by examining their performance on familiar training examples. This comparison provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of the systems across different datasets.</p><p>In this year's evaluation, the submitted runs were assessed by comparing them to a new set of 245 manually simplified sentences from the small dataset extracted from relevant passages for Task 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>To evaluate the simplification results, we used the EASSE implementation <ref type="bibr" coords="4,419.54,107.54,12.82,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> of the following metrics:</p><p>• FKGL: The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level <ref type="bibr" coords="4,287.77,143.60,12.68,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is a readability metric that provides an estimate of the education level required to understand the text. FKGL is based on two factors: average sentence length and average number of syllables per word. The resulting grade level indicates the U.S. school grade equivalent required to comprehend the text.</p><p>• SARI metric compares the system's output to multiple simplification references and the original sentence based on the words added, deleted, and kept by a system <ref type="bibr" coords="4,449.96,220.31,11.43,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>• BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric commonly used in machine translation to assess the quality of a translated text by comparing it to one or more reference translations <ref type="bibr" coords="4,171.90,269.93,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It operates by comparing n-grams (contiguous sequences of words) in the candidate translation to the n-grams in the reference translations.</p><p>• Compression ratio is calculated by comparing the size of the original text to the size of the simplified version.</p><p>• Sentence splits refer to the division of a source sentence into multiple sentences.</p><p>• Levenshtein similarity measures the number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one sentence into another.</p><p>• Exact copies refer to the number of unchanged original (source) sentences during the simplification process.</p><p>• Additions proportion calculates the ratio of added content introduced in the simplified text compared to the original text.</p><p>• Deletions proportion calculates the ratio of content deleted from the original text during the simplification process.</p><p>• Lexical complexity score computed by taking the log-ranks of each word in the frequency table <ref type="bibr" coords="4,175.94,522.38,11.43,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Scientific Text Simplification Approaches</head><p>In this section, we discuss a range of text simplification approaches that have been applied to scientific text as provided by the track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Evaluation on the test data</head><p>A total of 14 teams submitted 32 runs for Task 3, mainly LLMs. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,399.83,278.28,5.09,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the results of participants' runs according to the automatic evaluation listed in Section 2.2. Surprisingly, all systems modified the original sentences (Exact copies = 0). While many participants applied the same LLMs, such as GPT-3 and T5, their results differ a great deal.</p><p>According to the evaluation results, all runs in the track demonstrated improvements in FKGL readability score compared to the identity baseline (i.e., the source sentences). This suggests that the systems were able to generate shorter sentences with shorter words on average. However, it is important to note that shorter words are not necessarily synonymous with simplicity, as they may include numerous abbreviations or specialized terms. The original sentences had an FKGL score of approximately 14, which corresponds to a university-level text. However, the majority of the submitted runs achieved lower FKGL scores ranging from 11 to 12, indicating a level of complexity comparable to that of texts encountered at the completion of compulsory education.</p><p>In terms of the SARI (System Output Against References and Input) score, all runs exhibited significant improvements compared to the original sentences. However, it is worth noting that the source sentences had the highest vocabulary overlap with the reference sentences according to the BLEU score on the test data, suggesting a closer resemblance in terms of the words used.</p><p>Overall, the results indicate that the track participants were successful in generating simplified sentences with improved readability, as evidenced by the FKGL and SARI scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Evaluation on the train data</head><p>The test data included all the input sentences corresponding to the reference sentences used as train data in 2023. Therefore, we can provide an additional evaluation on 2022 text simplification data <ref type="bibr" coords="6,110.96,585.44,11.36,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,125.04,585.44,12.32,10.91" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.96,598.99,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the evaluation over these 648 sentences. A few observations can be made. First, we broadly see a similar effectiveness pattern as on the new test data in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,470.26,612.54,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> above, with larger language models outperforming smaller ones. Second, the difference in performance between the very large models (e.g., OpenAI) and trainable models (e.g., GPT-2) is smaller on the train evaluation. Third, some models score exceedingly well on the train evaluation (e.g., SARI and BLEU above 50%) but less well on the new evaluation. This signals both the ability to effectively train text simplification models for the domain, but also the risk of overfitting models and the need for independent evaluation data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Analysis of simplification quality</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Lexical and syntax difficulty analysis</head><p>In order to evaluate the quality of our train data (648 manually simplified sentences), we compared simplified and source sentences according to the following metrics:</p><p>• FKGL readability score that relies on average sentence lengths and number of syllables per word <ref type="bibr" coords="9,159.74,387.04,11.56,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>;</p><p>• Average number of abbreviations per sentence. The list of abbreviations was taken from Task 2.1 <ref type="bibr" coords="9,155.04,423.11,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,169.12,423.11,7.57,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>• Average number of difficult terms per sentence. The list of difficult terms was constructed from the data used for the evaluation of Task 2.1 <ref type="bibr" coords="9,335.00,459.17,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,349.08,459.17,7.57,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,115.24,481.69,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_3">3</ref> reports the scores of manually simplified and source sentences used in Task 3 according to these three metrics. The table provides evidence that our manual simplifications reduce text difficulty not only in terms of readability score, but our simplified sentences have more than 50% less difficult terms and abbreviations. These results also show that our tasks are closely interconnected. A master's student in translation and technical writing manually assessed the syntactic and lexical complexity of the simplification of 319 simplified sentences from the participants' runs, corresponding to 17 distinct source sentences evaluated using the same criteria. This evaluation is also a score ranging from 1 to 7 assigned to the simplification, with 1 representing simple and 7 representing complex. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,240.78,603.63,5.00,10.91" target="#tab_4">4</ref> provides evidence that automatic simplification is effective in terms of reducing syntax difficulty. However, lexical difficulty, i.e. the presence of difficult scientific terms, is much higher and thus remains the main barrier to understanding a scientific text.</p><p>We illustrate the syntactic and lexical complexity with a number of examples. The passage from Example 5.1 was scored 1 according to the complexity of its syntax and 3 according to the complexity of its vocabulary, while Example 5.2 was scored 2 according to the complexity of its syntax and 4 according to the complexity of its vocabulary.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table" coords="10,132.52,483.95,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_5">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="10,161.24,483.95,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_6">6</ref> provide syntax and lexical complexity annotations for the simplifications of the passages from Examples 5.1 and 5.2 respectively. Simplification complexity scores in Example 5.2 (Table <ref type="table" coords="10,175.43,511.05,4.14,10.91" target="#tab_6">6</ref>) show that reducing syntax complexity may lead to an increase in lexical complexity as some difficult scientific terms may not be explained in the text, such as personal digital assistant; PDA in the example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 5.3. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.).</head><p>The complexity of the source sentence from Example 5.3 was reduced drastically (syntax 2 → 1, lexical 4 → 1) by a system as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,330.24,623.82,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_7">7</ref>. However, the first simplification is a clear example of the hallucination problem in LLMs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Errors &amp; Information distortion</head><p>For these 319 simplified sentences, we also verified other parameters: the syntax, the presence of unresolved references due to simplification, unnecessary repetition, and any spelling, typographic, or punctuation errors. The example of the annotation is given in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,462.68,276.85,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_8">8</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="12,500.81,276.85,5.17,10.91">9</ref> provides statistics on the error types found in generated simplifications. The most common errors (30%) are spelling, typographic, and punctuational. These are followed by unresolved anaphora due to simplification (11%), and unnecessary repetion (5%).</p><p>In order to analyze information distortion <ref type="bibr" coords="12,289.23,331.05,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a master student in translation and technical writing and a university translator manually annotated 425 pairs of source sentences and simplifications submitted by the participants, corresponding to 22 distinct source sentences. Sentences were assigned with binary labels corresponding to the occurrence of the information distortion types. The objective was to determine whether there had been any information distortion during the simplification process, and if so, what type of distortion and what level of information loss severity there has been, on a scale from 1 to 7. We considered the following types of information distortions: contresens (misinterpretation), topic shift, ambiguity, omission of essential details with regard to a query, overgeneralization, oversimplification, wrong synonym, insertion of false or unsupported information, insertion of unnecessary details with regard to a query, redundancy, repetition/iteration, style, nonsense. If we considered there to be a distortion, we entered "YES" in the information distortion column, and also entered "YES" in the column corresponding to the specific error found. In cases of distortion, we also indicated the information loss severity, as we considered it, ranging from 1 to 7. For many sentence pairs, multiple types of information distortion were assigned. Table <ref type="table" coords="12,127.51,534.29,10.35,10.91" target="#tab_9">10</ref> provides an example of annotation of information distortion. In 31% of cases we have not identify information distortion. Statistics on the information distortion severity on the scale of 1-7 is given in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,215.66,561.39,8.22,10.91" target="#tab_10">11</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="12,257.60,561.39,9.97,10.91" target="#tab_2">12</ref> provides statistics on the information distortion types identified in the participants' runs.</p><p>Most information distortions are Omission of essential details with regard to a query and Oversimplification especially in sentences with a few difficult scientific terms. It might be explained by the fact that typically, text simplification involves the removal of complex or difficult-tounderstand elements and the reduction of text length.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Analysis of hallucination</head><p>The hallucination problem refers to the tendency of LLMs to generate plausible but incorrect or misleading information that is not grounded in reality. In terms of information distortion types we introduced in [3], LLMs' hallucinations refer mainly to Topic shift, Insertion of false or unsupported information, Insertion of unnecessary details with regard to a query. Note that Non-sense was attributed to incomplete sentences as in Examples 5.4 and 5.5. Contresens as in Table <ref type="table" coords="15,115.79,354.32,10.15,10.91" target="#tab_4">14</ref> seems to be caused by extreme deletion of terms and not by LLMs' hallucination.</p><p>Example 5.4. the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of mobile learning on the interaction between students and the Example 5.5. such as routing, search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites, etc.).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="15,127.03,460.62,10.15,10.91" target="#tab_12">15</ref> provides some examples of hallucination in generated simplifications.</p><p>We conduct a deeper analysis of some of the sources of hallucination and it's prevalence in the submitted generated text simplifications.</p><p>We first show the human text simplifications in the ground truth data. Table <ref type="table" coords="15,463.44,506.99,10.35,10.91" target="#tab_13">16</ref> shows an example of a human reference simplification, combining the input sentences belonging to the abstract of the document 𝑖𝑑 = 130055196 retrieved for query G01.1. Here, we show the deletions and insertions relative to the source input sentences (in this case on the first 4 sentences).

Most simplifications are revisions of the input, but we also observe that sometimes an entire sentence is inserted (shown as xxx in Table <ref type="table" coords="15,487.83,588.29,7.90,10.91" target="#tab_14">17</ref>).</p><p>Modern text simplification approaches are based on sequence-to-sequence models and generate simplified text by exploiting the superior text generation capacity of these models. However, these models are trained to complete any textual prompt and in text generation mode may generate additional output.

Hence, this is a form of 'hallucination' that is a serious risk for the use-case of the track. Table <ref type="table" coords="16,126.76,653.50,10.03,10.91" target="#tab_8">18</ref> quantifies how often such spurious generation occurs.

First, the number and fraction of spurious sentences vary considerably, with the majority of submissions having zero or very few cases (0-1%). Second, several submissions have notable fractions of spurious sentences in the output, with four runs over 20% and even one over 50% of input sentences. Third, standard test simplification evaluation measures (as shown in Tables <ref type="table" coords="17,364.99,611.78,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="17,393.50,611.78,4.25,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) are almost completely insensitive to spurious sentences. Standard measures such as BLEU or SARI are based on (positive) text overlap with the reference simplifications. Hence, there is only a very marginal these sentences to enhance their accessibility and comprehensibility for a general audience. The paper highlights the key aspects and goals of the task within the broader context of the CLEF 2023 SimpleText track. This task is closely connected to Task 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="19,390.20,114.06,12.68,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of the SimpleText track on difficult term identification and explanation. A parallel corpus of sentences was constructed by extracting sentences from scientific publication abstracts, and these sentences were subsequently manually simplified. These manual simplifications reduce text difficulty in terms of readability score and a significant decrease (50%) in difficult terms and abbreviations from Task 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="19,335.54,181.81,13.00,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> compared to the source sentences. This parallel corpus serves as a valuable resource for training and developing models for text simplification in the context of the task. The availability of a substantial amount of manually simplified sentences facilitates the exploration and development of various approaches and techniques in the field.</p><p>Regarding the different approaches to the tasks and their effectiveness, a few notable observations were made. Firstly, the results of similar methods varied considerably depending on factors such as implementation, fine-tuning, and the use of prompts. Secondly, apart from effectiveness, the efficiency of the approaches is crucial, as limitations on tokens or time often made participants submit incomplete runs based on language models.</p><p>In terms of automatic simplification, it proved effective in reducing syntax difficulty and optimizing the FKGL (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) score. However, the presence of difficult scientific terms (lexical difficulty) remains a major obstacle to understanding scientific texts. By focusing on reducing syntax complexity in text simplification, there is a possibility of encountering an increase in lexical complexity. This is because some challenging scientific terms may not be adequately explained or simplified in the simplified text. These findings highlight the interdependence of the SimpleText tasks and the importance of investigating their key dependencies.</p><p>The most common errors introduced during simplification were spelling, typographic, and punctuational mistakes (30%), followed by unresolved anaphora introduced by simplification (11%). In 15% of cases the information was distorted by omission of essential details, while oversimplification occurs in 10% of analyzed instances. Although, text simplification aims to make the content more understandable and accessible, often by removing complex or difficult-tounderstand elements, it is crucial to strike a balance and avoid removing essential information that is necessary for the overall meaning and coherence of the text and avoid severe information distortion. In the process of simplification, there is a risk of significant information loss when essential details are omitted or when anaphora (referencing previous words or phrases) is left unresolved. This can result in a complete loss of the overall meaning or sense of the text. In some cases, the excessive suppression of words may lead to the introduction of contresens (contradictory or nonsensical statements) which further affects the accuracy and coherence of the simplified text. Another issue noted was when there were no errors or distortion but also no simplification: the model produced a sentence nearly identical to the original with no improvement.</p><p>LLMs tend to generate responses that might sound plausible and coherent but are not necessarily accurate or factual. Improving the factuality, accuracy, and overall reliability of LLM outputs is a crucial goal to ensure that these models provide reliable and trustworthy information to users. We observed the following information types which might be caused by LLMs' hallucinations: Topic shift, Insertion of false or unsupported information, Insertion of unnecessary details with regard to a query representing around 10% of analyzed simplifications.</p><p>The overall conclusion drawn from the CLEF 2023 SimpleText track is that significant progress has been made by the state-of-the-art models, but there is still ample room for improvement. In future work, we will aim to quantify this and, through manual annotation, score 'good' simplifications as well as poor transformations. It would be interesting to look for any association of such 'adventurousness' of simplification back to the particular models under test, as it would be to know if there are links between models and distortion type. Exploring the information distortion introduced by simplification is an area of focus for further research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="7,88.99,90.49,282.48,20.87"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Results for task 3 (task number removed from the run_id) on the test</figDesc><table /></figure>
