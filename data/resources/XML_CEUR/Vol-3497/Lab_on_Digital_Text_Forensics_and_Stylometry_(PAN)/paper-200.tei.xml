<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This overview presents the Author Profiling shared task at PAN2023. This year the main aim is identifying cryptocurrency influencers in social media from a low-resource perspective. We focused on English Twitter posts for three different sub-tasks: (1) SubTask1. Low-resource influencer profiling; (2) SubTask2. Low-resource influencer interest profiling; and (3) SubTask3. Low-resource influencer intent profiling. For this purpose, three English datasets have been provided to the participants. A total of 27 teams participated in the shared task, and we compared their performance with four baseline approaches. This overview paper reviews the approaches of the participants and presents a detailed discussion of the evaluation results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Cryptocurrencies have massively increased their popularity in recent years <ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.37,426.41,11.28,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This complex and dynamic ecosystem encompasses a wide range of elements, including various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps), among others.</p><p>At the current pace at which this field evolves, keeping track of its continuous development becomes a complex task. Due to the vast amount of information available nowadays, there are some who take up the challenge of riding this wave and attempting to reach its crest. The promise of independence from central authorities, increased transaction speed, cost savings (compared to the traditional financial system), and accessibility are some of the factors that attract many to this space. However, the rise of numerous frauds <ref type="bibr" coords="1,384.37,548.35,11.55,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, complex language, and extremely high volatility also raises many concerns. In this mixture of complexity, information overload and fear is where the new influencer gold rush <ref type="bibr" coords="2,337.69,100.52,11.32,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, who can shape public opinion and behavior, take the cryptocurrency realm into social media.</p><p>The study "The Impact of Social Media Influencers on Purchase Intention and the Mediation Effect of Customer Attitude" by Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.47,141.16,12.99,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> investigates the effectiveness of social media influencers, focusing on various factors. They found that consumer attitude mediates the relationship between these factors and purchase intention, which can be applied to the purchase and investment in cryptocurrencies. Thereby, due to the many walls that this ecosystem has and the power of influencers, we believe that many users trust social media influencers to bridge the gap in their lack of knowledge to later take investment decisions. As a consequence, profiling those influential actors becomes relevant.</p><p>Author profiling is the problem of distinguishing between classes of authors by studying how language is shared by people. This helps in identifying authors' individual characteristics, such as demographics, hate speech spreaders, among others.</p><p>With the use of the Author Profiling task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) within this field we make an approach to understand the size of an influencer, topics mentioned and interests. Their reach and ability to shape public opinion could lead to noticeable effects on the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies such as:</p><p>• Market Movements<ref type="foot" coords="2,197.38,335.42,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> : Influencers can cause significant fluctuations in the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies. Positive or negative statements about a particular cryptocurrency can lead to buying or selling sprees among their followers, causing sharp rises or falls in the cryptocurrency's price. • Promotion and Awareness<ref type="foot" coords="2,225.97,390.23,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> : Influencers can bring attention to lesser-known cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), or blockchain projects. Their endorsements can attract new investors or users, contributing to the growth and success of these projects. • Education<ref type="foot" coords="2,159.82,431.49,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> : Influencers often play a role in educating the public about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They can help demystify these complex topics and promote wider understanding and adoption. • Trust and Credibility 3 : Influencers who are seen as experts in the cryptocurrency field can lend credibility to certain projects or cryptocurrencies. Their endorsements can build trust among potential investors. <ref type="foot" coords="2,248.45,514.02,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> : There are concerns about potential market manipulation, where influencers could artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency for personal gain. This underscores the need for regulation and transparency in the cryptocurrency market.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Market Manipulation Concerns</head><p>It is important to note that the impact of influencers can be double-edged. While they can contribute to the growth and dynamism of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, they can also lead to increased volatility and potential risks for investors.</p><p>In this shared task, we aim to profile cryptocurrency influencers in social media from a low-resource perspective, that is, using little data. Specifically, we focus on English tweets for three different sub-tasks: (1) SubTask1. Low-resource influencer profiling: profile authors according to their degree of influence (non-influencer, nano, micro, macro, mega); (2) SubTask2. Low-resource influencer interest profiling: profile authors according to their main interests or areas of influence (technical information, price update, trading matters, gaming, other); and</p><p>(3) SubTask3. Low-resource influencer intent profiling: profile authors according to the intent of their messages (subjective opinion, financial information, advertising, announcement).</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers the state of the art on cryptocurrency and author profiling. Section 3 describes the created datasets and the evaluation measures, and Section 4 presents the participant's approaches. In Section 5, discuss the results achieved by the participants for each subtask and error analysis. Finally, Section 6 draws some conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Author Profiling</head><p>Author profiling is the problem of distinguishing between classes of authors by studying how language is shared by people. This helps in identifying authors' individual characteristics, such as age, gender, or language variety, among others. During the years 2013-2022, we addressed several of these aspects in the shared tasks organised at PAN. <ref type="foot" coords="3,362.29,383.25,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref>In 2013 the aim was to identify gender and age in social media texts for English and Spanish <ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.63,398.56,11.27,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In 2014 we addressed age identification from a continuous perspective (without gaps between age classes) in the context of several genres, such as blogs, Twitter, and reviews (in Trip Advisor), both in English and Spanish <ref type="bibr" coords="3,213.31,439.20,11.28,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In 2015, apart from age and gender identification, we addressed also personality recognition on Twitter in English, Spanish, Dutch, and Italian <ref type="bibr" coords="3,437.62,452.75,11.39,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In 2016, we addressed the problem of cross-genre gender and age identification (training on Twitter data and testing on blogs and social media data) in English, Spanish, and Dutch <ref type="bibr" coords="3,434.25,479.85,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In 2017, we addressed gender and language variety identification in Twitter in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic <ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.79,506.95,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In 2018, we investigated gender identification on Twitter from a multimodal perspective, considering also the images linked within tweets; the dataset was composed of English, Spanish, and Arabic tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.56,547.60,16.25,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>In 2019 our focus was on profiling and discriminating bots from humans on the basis of textual data only <ref type="bibr" coords="3,167.02,574.70,17.91,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and targeting both English and Spanish tweets.</p><p>In 2020, we focused on profiling fake news spreaders <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.01,588.25,16.41,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, in two languages, English and Spanish. The ease of publishing content on social media has also increased the amount of disinformation that is published and shared. The goal of this shared task was to profile those authors who have shared some fake news in the past.</p><p>In 2021 the focus was on profiling hate speech spreaders in social media <ref type="bibr" coords="4,423.56,86.97,16.25,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The goal was to identify Twitter users who can be considered haters, depending on the number of tweets with hateful content that they had spread. The task was set in English and Spanish.</p><p>Finally, in 2022, we focused on profiling irony and stereotype spreaders on English tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.55,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. The shared task goal was to profile highly ironic authors and those that employ irony to convey stereotypical messages, e.g. towards women or the LGTB community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cryptocurrencies with Machine Learning/Deep Learning</head><p>Cryptocurrencies, a digital or virtual form of currency, have become a significant area of interest in various scientific domains. The multidisciplinary nature of cryptocurrency research reflects its wide-ranging implications and the diverse challenges and opportunities it presents. Many of these domains are related with Finance, law regulations, cybersecurity etc... The domain in which we are more interested in is Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT).</p><p>Within the domain we see that most works are around systems security <ref type="bibr" coords="4,437.75,272.19,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, blockchain technology applications <ref type="bibr" coords="4,197.17,285.73,16.15,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, predictions using time series <ref type="bibr" coords="4,348.89,285.73,16.35,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.97,285.73,12.52,10.91" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,383.22,285.73,13.98,10.91" target="#b18">19]</ref> and scarce investigation related to social media.</p><p>Within the field we find studies around the following: The manipulation of cryptocurrencies through social media platforms, particularly "pump and dump" scams. The authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.91,326.38,18.07,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> propose a computational approach to automatically identify these scams as they happen by combining information across social media platforms.</p><p>Prediction of cryptocurrency price bubbles based on social media data. The authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,488.09,367.03,17.89,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> argue that financial price bubbles have similarities with the spread of an epidemic, as both involve a rapid increase followed by a decline. The model takes into account social media indicators such as the number of posts on a subreddit and the number of new subscribers.</p><p>Relationship between cryptocurrency price changes and topic discussion on social media. The authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,138.19,434.78,17.75,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> use a dynamic topic modelling approach to analyze social media communication and a Hawkes model to find interactions between topics and cryptocurrency prices. They suggest that this knowledge could be built into a real-time system, providing trading or alerting signals.</p><p>Prediction of the volatile price movement of cryptocurrency by analyzing the sentiment in social media and finding the correlation between them <ref type="bibr" coords="4,335.12,502.52,16.25,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluation Framework</head><p>This section introduces the technical background. We outline the creation of the datasets, introduce the performance measures, baselines, and describe the software submissions procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Corpus</head><p>As in previous years, a new dataset has been created from English tweets posted by users on Twitter. We built the datasets as follows: first we identified those who are crypto influencers, and next we classified their interest and intent.</p><p>We identify crypto influencer candidates with two conditions:</p><p>• user with tweets that contain the ticker cashtag<ref type="foot" coords="5,327.87,85.21,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> for different crypto projects e.g. $ETH, $BTC, $UNI. • tweets with mentions in the name of the crypto projects e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin and Uniswap. In the AppendixA can be found the total list of projects used.</p><p>Next, we extract the number of followers for those users. Finally, we use a follower scale to determine their influence grade. This scale is adjusted as much as possible to the most commonly accepted definition of influencer tiers<ref type="foot" coords="5,305.63,176.83,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref> :</p><p>• Non-influencer: Individuals with a minimal social media following; typically ranging from 0 to 1,000 followers. Lacks the ability to sway opinions or impact decisions through their online presence. • Nano influencers: Individuals with a small, dedicated social media following; typically ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 followers. • Micro influencers: Individuals with a moderately sized social media following ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 followers. They often have a more focused and engaged audience. • Macro influencers: Individuals with a substantial social media following, ranging from 100,000 to 1 million followers. They have a wide reach and may cover a broader range of topics or industries. • Mega influencers: Individuals with an extensive social media following, more than 1 million followers. They often have a significant impact on popular culture and possess considerable influence across multiple platforms.</p><p>For the interest and intent datasets, we applied the following criteria after the influencer identification. For each influencer, human annotators classified the interest and intent for a random tweet sample. For the annotation process, we provide a list of labels and definitions for each task. Interest labels definition:</p><p>• Technical information: Post related to the technical aspects of a crypto project or asset, including infrastructure, consensus, mining, development, security, privacy, road map, compatibility etc... • Trading matters: Post related to technical analysis, volatility, trading decision, risk management, and other trading-related topics. • Price update: Post related to price, price speculation (e.g. "to the moon"), and price prediction, without mentioning trading-specific topics. • Gaming: Post with mentions of a project or topic related to Gaming, e.g. Play2earn, GameFi, NFT drops, metaverse. • Other: If none of other labels applies. Intent labels definition:</p><p>• Announcement: Post related to the announcement of events, progress, launch, partnership, or other official announcements. • Subjective opinion: Post with some subjective opinion, response, or advice.</p><p>• Financial information: Post related to the update of price, whale signal, market, or other financial data without subjective comment. • Advertising: Post related to introducing or promoting a project, account, user, website, event, etc...</p><p>The process was as follows: the tweets were annotated by three independent annotators; then, we used majority voting to select the class, and in the case of annotators' disagreement, the tweet was discarded. Also, we calculated the Fleiss Kappa <ref type="bibr" coords="6,377.16,393.86,18.07,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> agreement between the annotators, obtained 0.65 for the interest task and 0.67 for the intent task. These results can be interpreted as the annotators having a substantial agreement between them in both tasks.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.61,434.50,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the statistics of the datasets, and the number of users for each class. Due to the low resources task nature, the number of tweets shared with our participants is limited: for SubTask1 the maximum number of tweets is 10. To further study the low-resource author profiling, we limited the number of tweets per user in SubTask2 and SubTask3 to a single one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Performance Measures</head><p>Since the datasets are very unbalanced, we employed macro F 1 as the official metric to measure the performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Features Extraction</head><p>As in previous editions of the author profiling task at PAN, participants used different features, such as: (1) n-grams and (2) deep learning-based such as word2vec embeddings and BERT embeddings. Regarding n-grams, two teams (terra and icon <ref type="bibr" coords="7,362.48,568.07,17.11,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref>) used TF-IDF <ref type="bibr" coords="7,446.36,568.07,18.06,10.91" target="#b37">[38]</ref> n-grams. The authors of the icon <ref type="bibr" coords="7,195.57,581.62,17.99,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref> team have combined different types of n-grams, TF-IDF n-grams with word2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="7,159.29,595.17,18.07,10.91" target="#b38">[39]</ref> embeddings. For the second group, five different teams employed different transformers models to extract features. For instance, two teams (Shashirekha <ref type="bibr" coords="7,467.92,608.72,18.07,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and sushiswap) employed the sentence T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,262.44,86.97,18.07,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> model. In another case, the ethereum team tested different BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="8,159.93,100.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b39">[40]</ref> models, e.g. BERT, BERTweet <ref type="bibr" coords="8,319.21,100.52,16.41,10.91" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Data Augmentation</head><p>Some teams employed data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training data and solve the overfitting and underfitting problems. The holo team used the pegasus paraphrase 11  model to generate variations of each original tweet while keeping its meaning. Two teams (stellar and ethereum) proposed different approaches using ChatGPT 12 . In the case of stellar, its approach leverages the generative capabilities of ChatGPT to generate labeled synthetic authors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have presented the results of the 11 th International Author Profiling Shared Task at PAN 2023, hosted at CLEF 2023. This edition focused on English texts, and the participants had to profile cryptocurrency influencers in Twitter, from a low-resource perspective. Specifically, we requested to profile the influence degree, the interests, and intents of the influencers. The participants used different features to address the task, mainly: (1) n-grams and (2) deep learning-based such as classical word embeddings (e.g. word2vec) and more modern transformerbased ones (e.g. BERT). Concerning the classification part, most of the teams approached the task with deep learning techniques, being transformer-based classifiers (BERT and DeBERTA) the most popular.</p><p>The best results for profiling the influencer's degree (SubTask1) have been obtained by the holo team with (62.32 Macro F 1 ) with the approach of fine-tuning the RoBERTuito transformer-based model. The best results for the interests subtask (Subtask2) have been obtained by the stellar <ref type="bibr" coords="13,488.23,634.34,17.76,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> team (67.12 Macro F 1 ) with data augmentation technique employed GPT and a method which combined a BERT model with an NLI model. Finally, the best results for the intents subtask  The error analysis per SubTask1 shows that the highest confusion is from macro to mega (40%). Similar behavior is shown between micro and nano (37%). The non-influencer category could be confused with micro influencer (20%). In the case of SubTask2 the error analysis shows that the most difficult class to classify by the participant systems is the other class (44%) and the easier to identify is gaming class (77%). For SubTask3, the authors' most recognizable intent comes from the financial information class (79%), and advertising and announcement can be confused (24% and 15%).</p><p>Looking at the results and the error analysis, we can conclude that: (1) it is possible to automatically identify cryptocurrency influencers and their interest and intent with acceptable Macro F 1 (while there is room for improvement); (2) transformer-based models outperform traditional approaches for the task of cryptocurrency influencers. This highlights their potential for low-resource author profiling scenarios. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,89.29,409.29,344.96,9.43"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Distribution of results regarding Macro F 1 and Accuracy for each subtask.</figDesc></figure>
