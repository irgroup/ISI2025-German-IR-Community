<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The authorship verification task for PAN 2023 focuses on a very challenging scenario: given a pair of texts belonging to different discourse types, the task is to determine whether they were authored by the same person. In addition, for the first time, we consider discourse types from both written (i.e., essays and emails) and spoken language (i.e., interviews and speech transcriptions). New datasets in English are provided and we adopt the same evaluation setup and measures as similar tasks in recent editions of PAN. A total of eleven teams submitted 27 runs and were evaluated along with several baselines on the TIRA experimental platform.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There are many cases where the authorship of a text is disputed. These include literary works published anonymously or under a pseudonym, threats on social media, phishing emails, plagiarism in academic papers, etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,250.68,464.05,11.48,4.94" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,264.99,464.05,7.52,4.94" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,275.34,464.05,7.65,4.94" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Authorship analysis is based on text analysis to determine information about the author of a particular text. The basic idea is that the personal writing style of authors can be distinguished using appropriate stylometric methods to represent documents <ref type="bibr" coords="1,139.61,504.70,11.28,4.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Provided that a set of candidate authors is available, it is possible to define tasks for closed-set or open-set authorship attribution tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="1,332.01,518.24,11.43,4.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>A more fundamental task in authorship analysis is authorship verification, as it addresses the basic question of whether a particular person authored a text of disputed authorship <ref type="bibr" coords="1,460.90,545.34,11.24,4.94" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,474.86,545.34,7.43,4.94" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,485.01,545.34,7.49,4.94" target="#b7">8]</ref>. It is easy to see that any case of authorship attribution can be split into a number of verification instances (i.e., one for each candidate author). Generally, a set of texts known to be written by the author in question is given, and the task aims at identifying stylistic similarities/differences between these texts and the disputed text <ref type="bibr" coords="1,270.88,599.54,11.28,4.94" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In the simplest form of the authorship verification task, there is only one text of known authorship, so this case may be better described as determining whether a pair of texts was authored by the same person <ref type="bibr" coords="1,402.26,626.64,16.25,4.94" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Several factors can influence the effectiveness of an authorship verification method. Certainly, text length is one of them, because it is very difficult to adequately represent the stylistic features of very short documents. Conversely, the limited input length of modern pre-trained language models can make it difficult to deal with long documents <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.04,130.88,16.42,4.94" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In addition, topic similarities/differences between the documents involved can be misleading (e.g., two documents may appear similar because of a common topic and not because of their writing style) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.15,157.97,16.41,4.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In cases where the documents of known and unknown authorship belong to different genres or discourse types (e.g., essay vs. e-mail), it is very difficult to focus on the authors' writing style characteristics that are preserved when writing in different degrees of formality or for different audiences. Such cases are not unrealistic, however, since it is not always possible to find undisputed texts written by a particular person in a particular type of discourse.</p><p>PAN has included a task on authorship verification in several previous editions which has increased the attention of the international research community to this task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.65,252.82,16.43,4.94" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.81,252.82,12.55,4.94" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.08,252.82,12.55,4.94" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.36,252.82,12.55,4.94" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,494.64,252.82,12.55,4.94" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.04,266.37,12.42,4.94" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The focus of several editions has been on cross-domain authorship verification, where documents with known and unknown authorship come from different domains (e.g., topic areas or genres) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.63,293.47,16.55,4.94" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.12,293.47,12.59,4.94" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.65,293.47,12.42,4.94" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Recent PAN editions have focused on fanfiction texts (i.e., nonprofessional fiction published online by fans of well-known works), with documents of known and unknown authorship belonging to various fandoms (e.g., Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes). The abundance of online fanfiction documents covering multiple fandoms enabled the creation of large datasets. The results obtained show that authorship verification in fanfiction can be performed with relatively high accuracy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.47,361.21,16.43,4.94" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,290.63,361.21,12.32,4.94" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>In the previous edition of PAN, we considered a more challenging scenario, namely crossdiscourse type authorship verification, where documents of known and unknown authorship belong to different discourse types (i.e., essays, emails, text messages, and business memos) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.56,401.86,16.08,4.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, the nature of discourse also affects the text length of documents (e.g., essays are much longer than text messages). The obtained results confirm that it is extremely difficult to identify the features of writing style related to the author's personal style in such a variety of discourse types.</p><p>In the current edition of PAN, we continue to focus on cross-discourse type authorship verification of document pairs. Unlike previous versions of the task, which used only written language discourse types, the main innovation is that we also consider spoken language. This provides an opportunity to examine the ability of authorship verification methods to deal with the completely different expressions of written and oral language. Most forms of written language are more formal, have a larger vocabulary, and are syntactically more complex than oral language. Oral language, by contrast, is mainly conversational and relatively spontaneous <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.49,550.90,16.14,4.94" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. It is therefore very difficult to identify the stylistic features of one and the same person who expresses themselves both in writing and orally.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the new datasets available for training and evaluating authorship verification methods under crossdiscourse conditions. We then define the framework for evaluating the shared task for authorship verification on PAN'23. Then, the submissions received are examined and their effectiveness and efficiency are analytically evaluated. Finally, we discuss the main conclusions and possible directions for future work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The PAN'23 Authorship Verification Corpus</head><p>Similar to the PAN'22 edition of the task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,275.43,499.87,16.41,4.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the new dataset is based on the current Aston 100 Idiolects Corpus in English. <ref type="foot" coords="3,234.55,510.79,3.71,3.61" target="#foot_0">1</ref> This corpus contains a variety of discourse types written by about 100 people. All subjects are of similar age <ref type="bibr" coords="3,322.35,526.97,13.32,4.94" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,335.68,526.97,4.44,4.94" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,335.68,526.97,4.44,4.94" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,335.68,526.97,4.44,4.94" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,340.12,526.97,13.32,4.94" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and native English speakers. The topic of the text samples is not restricted. Specifically, we consider four discourse types: two from written language (i.e., emails and essays) and two from oral language (i.e., interviews and speech transcripts). All six possible pairings of discourse types are examined. Note that the essay-email pairing was also included in the PAN'22 dataset. Since the length of e-mails can be very short, we concatenate consecutive messages (ordered by date) so that we get text samples of at least 2,000 characters. Since the corpus also contains individual interview utterances, we also concatenate consecutive utterances to obtain text samples of at least 2,000 characters. All text samples in the corpus have been pre-processed to replace named entities with general tags. This helps to reduce the potentially confusing influence of topics on classification. Examples of such tags can be seen in the text samples of Table <ref type="table" coords="4,128.58,351.13,3.81,4.94" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Finally, nonverbal vocalizations (e.g., coughing, laughing) that occur regularly in spoken discourse are also replaced by special tags.</p><p>To create training and test datasets, we first split the available individuals into two equally sized, non-overlapping sets. More specifically, the text samples of 56 individuals are used for the training dataset and the test dataset is obtained from another set of 56 individuals. Both groups of authors have a similar gender distribution. Each dataset consists of a set of document pairs, and in each pair the documents belong to different discourse types. Because the distribution of available text samples across discourse types is not balanced, the distribution of document pairs across the six possible pairs of discourse types is also not homogeneous, as can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,116.44,473.07,3.81,4.94" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. However, it is strikingly similar between training and test datasets. Moreover, both datasets are balanced with respect to pairs with the same author and pairs with different authors. This is also true when each specific pairing of discourse types is considered separately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluation Setup</head><p>The evaluation setup is similar to the one used for the previous shared tasks at <ref type="bibr" coords="4,434.53,558.79,39.01,4.94">PAN [16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,476.20,558.79,12.50,4.94" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,491.36,558.79,12.23,4.94" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Formally, the objective function 𝜑 : (𝑑 𝑘 , 𝑑 𝑢 ) → {𝑇, 𝐹 }, where 𝑑 𝑘 is a text of known authorship, 𝑑 𝑢 is a text of unknown or disputed authorship, and {𝑇, 𝐹 } indicate truth values has to be approximated. If 𝜑(𝑑 𝑘 , 𝑑 𝑢 ) = 𝑇 , then the author of 𝑑 𝑘 is also the author of 𝑑 𝑢 , and if 𝜑(𝑑 𝑘 , 𝑑 𝑢 ) = 𝐹 , then the author of 𝑑 𝑘 is not the same as the author of 𝑑 𝑢 . In the current edition of the task, 𝑑 𝑘 and 𝑑 𝑢 belong to different discourse types of written or oral language.</p><p>For each instance of authorship verification (i.e., a text pair) in the test dataset, participants must provide a scalar score 𝑎 𝑖 (in the range [0, 1]) indicating the probability that the pair was authored by the same person. It is possible for participants to leave text pairs unanswered by giving a score of exactly 𝑎 𝑖 = 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Evaluation measures</head><p>Following the practice of recent editions of the authorship verification task <ref type="bibr" coords="5,420.22,110.80,16.31,4.94" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,439.26,110.80,12.23,4.94" target="#b17">18]</ref>, we adopt a number of effectiveness measures to highlight different aspects of the capabilities of an authorship verification model. Specifically, the following measures have been used for evaluation:</p><p>• AUROC: the area under the ROC curve. • c@1: a variant of the conventional accuracy measure that rewards systems that leave difficult verification cases unanswered <ref type="bibr" coords="5,289.87,185.80,16.25,4.94" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. • F 1 : the well-known F 1 -effectiveness measure (not considering unanswered cases). • F 0.5𝑢 : a newly proposed F 0.5 -based measure that highlights correctly answered instances of the same author and rewards unanswered instances <ref type="bibr" coords="5,361.42,227.82,16.25,4.94" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. • Brier: the complement of the Brier loss function <ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.13,242.06,17.93,4.94" target="#b22">[23]</ref> focusing on the accuracy of probabilistic predictions (as implemented in sklearn) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.81,255.61,15.89,4.94" target="#b23">[24]</ref>). This measure rewards verifiers that make "bold" but correct predictions (i.e., 𝑎 𝑖 close to 0.0 or 1.0) and it indirectly penalizes less confident ones, including non-answers (𝑎 𝑖 = 0.5). Consistent with the other measures, we take its complement so that higher scores correspond to better effectiveness. • The average of the above measures has been used as the final overall score for ranking the submitted systems.</p><p>All submitted systems are deployed and executed on TIRA <ref type="bibr" coords="5,347.20,344.56,16.09,4.94" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In addition to effectiveness, we also report the runtime to determine the efficiency of the submitted approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Baselines</head><p>Several baseline methods are used to obtain an estimate of the difficulty of the task and the specific evaluation data set. These baselines are established approaches from the relevant literature, representing both n-gram-based and neural network-based methods. The latter involve methods that performed relatively well in the previous edition of the task <ref type="bibr" coords="5,446.59,448.11,16.09,4.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which is very similar to the current one. Specifically, the following baselines are used:</p><p>• compressor: given a pair of texts 𝑡 1 and 𝑡 2 , the cross-entropy of 𝑡 2 is calculated based on the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) model of 𝑡 1 and vice versa <ref type="bibr" coords="5,439.49,495.33,16.34,4.94" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A logistic regression classifier is then trained using the mean and absolute difference of the two cross-entropies. In addition, using a small radius sets verification values around 0.5 to exactly 0.5. • cngdist: the most common 4-character frames are extracted from the training texts and used to represent each text. Then, for a pair of texts, the cosine similarity between the two texts is calculated <ref type="bibr" coords="5,219.99,577.31,11.58,4.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. During training, two thresholds 𝑝 1 and 𝑝 2 are optimized to scale the verification results. All review results lower than 𝑝 1 correspond to negative responses, all results higher than 𝑝 2 are scaled to positive responses, and the remaining results are set to 0.5, indicating difficult cases that are intentionally left unanswered. • najafi22: a pre-trained language model (T5) in combination with a convolutional neural network and an attention mechanism is used <ref type="bibr" coords="5,331.58,645.75,16.42,4.94" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In addition to text content, this approach also uses information about parts of speech, punctuation, emoji, and tags for named entities. In terms of overall effectiveness, this method achieved the best results in the PAN'22 edition of the task.</p><p>• galicia22: a neural graph network to represent text based on part-of-speech labels. Then, a Siamese network with a global attention layer and a final fully linked layer determines the output verification score. This method was very close to the best overall effectiveness on PAN'22.</p><p>The first two baselines (compressor and cngdist) are trained using the PAN'23 training dataset described in the previous section. The last two baselines (najafi22 and galicia22) are used exactly as they were submitted to PAN'22, i.e., they were trained on the PAN'22 training dataset, which only considers discourse types of written language <ref type="bibr" coords="6,318.17,460.81,16.25,4.94" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Survey of Submissions</head><p>We received eleven submissions from as many research teams, who deployed their software on TIRA. Each team also submitted a notebook describing the details of their method. In this section, a review of the main characteristics of the submitted methods is performed, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,128.76,560.09,3.81,4.94">3</ref>. The majority of participants use contextual embeddings provided by pre-trained language models to represent texts. Despite the availability of a number of pre-trained models, all of these approaches favor BERT models <ref type="bibr" coords="6,275.98,587.19,16.09,4.94" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Other neural network methods for representing text are based on graph convolutional networks <ref type="bibr" coords="6,300.30,600.73,17.76,4.94" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and a BiLSTM combined with an attention mechanism <ref type="bibr" coords="6,141.47,614.28,11.23,4.94" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,155.06,614.28,12.23,4.94" target="#b29">30]</ref>. Then again, some participants use more traditional features such as n-grams, function words, measures of vocabulary richness, etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,330.25,627.83,16.43,4.94" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,349.41,627.83,14.03,4.94" target="#b30">31]</ref> In terms of classification, a popular option is to place fully linked layers on top of neural-based text representation layers. Another approach popular with PAN'23 participants is contrastive learning. Finally, cosine similarity or Bayes factor scoring are used by distance-based approaches that utilize a number of features. Given the relatively small size of the training dataset, several participants are using deep learning approaches in an attempt to expand it. Most of these attempts use available metadata about the people who wrote the texts to identify all possible pairs of texts. In addition, one participant also used the PAN'22 training dataset to supplement the available data <ref type="bibr" coords="7,173.66,144.43,16.41,4.94" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Given the input length limitations of pre-trained language models, multiple PAN'23 participants segment input texts into sections and produce multiple pairs of text sections from the same original text pair <ref type="bibr" coords="7,297.08,171.52,16.56,4.94" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,316.56,171.52,12.42,4.94" target="#b37">38]</ref>. The scores of each text piece pair are then combined to obtain the final score of the original text pair.</p><p>Despite the fact that the PAN'23 dataset includes a set of six discourse type pairs (e.g., essayemail, essay-interview, etc.), the vast majority of submitted methods treat all of these pairs in a homogeneous manner. Only one participant used a discourse type-specific approach <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.35,225.72,16.25,4.94" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. More specifically, one model is trained on written discourse texts and another model is trained on spoken discourse texts. These are finally combined with a general model trained from all available texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation Results</head><p>We received submissions from eleven research teams. Unlike previous editions of the task, we allowed a maximum of three runs per participant to allow for a more thorough evaluation of the submitted methods if certain hyperparameter settings vary or if certain components of the proposed method are changed. In this paper, a total of 27 runs are evaluated. In addition, the four baselines described previously are also evaluated to provide useful insights.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,128.33,392.74,5.17,4.94">4</ref> contains the final evaluation results for the PAN'23 test dataset of all submitted software and baselines. As can be seen, the overall effectiveness of all evaluated methods is quite low. This reflects the difficulty of the task and shows that it is really difficult to identify personal stylistic features of authors across different discourse types, especially when both written and oral utterances are studied. The most successful approaches seem to follow the same basic architecture, namely a pre-trained language model combined with contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="7,475.57,460.49,16.38,4.94" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,494.66,460.49,12.53,4.94" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,89.29,474.04,12.23,4.94" target="#b37">38]</ref>. However, a naive distance-based baseline trained on character n-grams is very competitive. Moreover, a baseline trained on the PAN'22 dataset (galicia22) achieves a slightly better overall effectiveness than a very similar approach trained on the PAN'23 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="7,423.37,501.13,16.41,4.94" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The winning approach of Ibrahim et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,209.94,514.68,17.91,4.94" target="#b33">[34]</ref> achieves the best or near-best effectiveness on all evaluation measures. Several participants achieve relatively low Brier scores that significantly affect their overall effectiveness, despite achieving relatively high AUROC and c@1) scores <ref type="bibr" coords="7,441.75,541.78,16.35,4.94" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,460.83,541.78,12.51,4.94" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,476.08,541.78,12.51,4.94" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,491.32,541.78,12.26,4.94" target="#b38">39]</ref>. This can be explained by the fact that they all provide binary answers and not probability values. In most cases where multiple runs are submitted by the same team, there are no significant differences in effectiveness. An exception is Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,331.81,582.43,16.25,4.94" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, especially when F 1 is considered.</p></div>

In addition, essays in the PAN'23 dataset are on average four times longer than emails, interviews, and voice transcripts. Of the six discourse type pairs, one includes only written language texts (e.g., essay-email), one refers only to spoken language texts (e.g., interview-speech-transcription), while the remaining pairs examine a combination of written and spoken language.</p></div>

This is true for both the training and test datasets and for the different discourse type pairs. It is therefore interesting to examine whether the approaches presented provide a roughly balanced set of responses or whether they are biased toward a particular class (i.e., positive or negative responses). Moreover, according to the task's experiment setup, it is possible for participants to leave a verification instance unanswered by returning a probability of exactly 0.5. Some evaluation measures (e.g., c@1) are specifically designed to account for such response non-answers. Therefore, it is interesting to see which submitted approaches actually use this possibility and to what extent.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="11,127.29,90.23,5.13,4.94">6</ref> shows the percentage of positive and negative responses and non-answers relative to the total number of possible instances of the test dataset (i.e., 9,656 instances). It should be emphasized that the positive/negative answers reported are not necessarily correct. Also note that the percentages from the last run by Sanjesh and Mangai <ref type="bibr" coords="11,359.73,130.88,17.91,4.94" target="#b30">[31]</ref> do not add up to 100 because they only provided answers for a small subset of the evaluation data set.</p><p>As can be seen, most of the best performing approaches favor positive responses over negative ones. The two best runs of Ibrahim et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,267.64,171.52,17.91,4.94" target="#b33">[34]</ref> are relatively balanced in this respect. The runs of Petropoulos <ref type="bibr" coords="11,144.00,185.07,16.21,4.94" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Valdez Valenzuela et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,270.67,185.07,16.21,4.94" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,354.05,185.07,17.91,4.94" target="#b29">[30]</ref> are clearly focused on positive responses. An extreme case is the baseline cngdist, where almost all responses are positive. It is also noticeable that one run of Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,291.05,212.17,17.91,4.94" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (irregular-strategist) tends to have positive responses, while the other run (uniform-reward) has the opposite tendency.</p><p>As for the percentage of non-answer review cases, it is easy to see that few participants attempt to use this option. More specifically, Ibrahim et al. leaves a moderate number of instances (e.g., 13.9%) unanswered across all three runs. Moreover, Valdez Valenzuela et al. and Sanjesh and Mangai <ref type="bibr" coords="11,145.01,279.92,17.91,4.94" target="#b30">[31]</ref> exhibit at most 3% non-answers. An extreme case is the baseline compressor, which returns an answer less than 5% of the time. This probably means that a suitable tuning of the hyperparameters for this baseline could significantly improve its effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Efficiency</head><p>So far, we have focused on the effectiveness of the methods presented. Another dimension of the evaluation is their efficiency, which indicates how well they apply to large datasets for authorship verification. For this purpose, Table <ref type="table" coords="11,302.02,383.84,5.09,4.94">7</ref> shows the runtime of each submitted run as recorded by TIRA. Comparing the runtime of the two best-performing runs of Ibrahim et al. shows that resolving-globe is much faster than reduced-graph, although they achieve exactly the same effectiveness (see Table <ref type="table" coords="11,244.10,424.49,3.65,4.94">4</ref>). In fact, the former is the most efficient among all the submitted runs, with the exception of Multi-Feature Classifier by Sanjesh and Mangai, which, as mentioned before, processed only a small part of the test dataset. Other relatively fast approaches include the runs of Lv et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,272.79,465.14,17.91,4.94" target="#b36">[37]</ref> as well as Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,383.80,465.14,16.29,4.94" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The very competitive run of Guo et al. (irregular-strategist) has the highest runtime, much higher than the other run submitted (uniform-reward) by this team. Other approaches with relatively high runtime are the runs of Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,197.44,505.78,16.25,4.94" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,255.97,505.78,16.25,4.94" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and Sanjesh and Mangai (null-midpoint).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Several earlier editions of PAN included an authorship verification task. In all of them, a variety of datasets have been developed and used to evaluate dozens of methods. Several scenarios were considered, e.g., when a small set of documents of known authorship is provided in each verification instance <ref type="bibr" coords="11,180.89,605.06,16.33,4.94" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,199.95,605.06,12.51,4.94" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,215.19,605.06,12.25,4.94" target="#b14">15]</ref>, when only text pairs are examined <ref type="bibr" coords="11,388.97,605.06,16.33,4.94" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,408.03,605.06,12.51,4.94" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,423.27,605.06,12.25,4.94" target="#b17">18]</ref>, when multiple languages are included in the dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="11,259.83,618.61,16.56,4.94" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,279.10,618.61,12.59,4.94" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,294.41,618.61,12.42,4.94" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and when only English fanfiction texts are used <ref type="bibr" coords="11,113.64,632.16,16.55,4.94" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,133.60,632.16,12.42,4.94" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The research community in this area has evolved significantly over the past decade, motivated in part by relevant PAN shared tasks.</p><p>Following the practice of the previous PAN edition, we focus on particularly difficult cases in which the input texts belong to different discourse types, i.e., there are crucial differences in terms of target audience and communicative purpose. To make matters more challenging, in this edition we introduce the use of discourse types from both written and spoken language, with their inherent differences in formality and complexity. Not surprisingly, the effectiveness achieved is overall weak resembling in many cases a baseline with random estimates. When the average effectiveness of all participants is taken into account, the instances of authorship verification involving discourse types from both written and spoken language (e.g., interviewemail) are more difficult than those involving only written discourse types or only spoken discourse types. This shows that the PAN'23 dataset is even more difficult than the corresponding PAN'22 dataset.</p><p>The majority of the submitted approaches are based on neural methods. Several submissions, including the most effective ones, use a pre-trained language model in combination with contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="12,167.00,637.55,16.41,4.94" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This seems appropriate to discard similarities in topics and hopefully dissimilarities in discourse types <ref type="bibr" coords="12,233.64,651.10,16.09,4.94" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Conversely, there is lack of diversity in the methods used by participants, including the selection of the specific pre-trained language model. A broader variety of approaches could lead to a more comprehensive analysis and deeper insights. This certainly suggests that there is much room for improvement in cross-discourse authorship verification. A possible direction to achieve better results could be the development of methods able to adapt to each specific discourse type pairing, taking into account the general characteristics of the discourse types involved. In addition, an appropriate way to combine traditional n-gram-based approaches with neural-based models could provide improved performance.</p><p>Another promising direction for future work is to leverage the availability of powerful generative language models (e.g., GPT) to improve both authorship verification methods and the quality of their evaluation. Finally, exploring the link between authorship verification and machine-generated text recognition is an area that can be explored in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,88.99,100.45,416.52,348.67"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Two pairs of text samples from the dataset written by the same author in two discourse types.</figDesc><table coords="3,89.97,135.13,415.54,313.98"><row><cell>Interview</cell><cell>Email</cell></row><row><cell>Okay, erm, &lt;cough&gt;, so on a day when I'm going to the gym,</cell><cell>Hi &lt;addr6_FN&gt;,&lt;nl&gt;&lt;nl&gt;Thank you for clearing that up!
