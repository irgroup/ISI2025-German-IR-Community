<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the case of the Authorship verification task, where two texts belonging to different Discourse Types (DT) are given, the objective is to determine if they are written by the same author (cross-DT authorship verification). In this paper, we use a framework based on contrastive learning and a pre-trained language model to extract text features to solve the (authorship verification) task. Compared with traditional machine learning methods, the method based on contractive learning (SimCSE) can encode and get the comparison between the texts, enabling better handling of semantic matching. In the authorship verification task, the model can capture the author's writing style and characteristics more accurately by comparing the similarity between multiple texts of the same author, thus improving the model's classification performance. The experiment demonstrated competitive performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.76% on our test dataset, which was manually created from a PAN-provided dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The goal of the PAN@CLEF 2023 Authorship verification <ref type="bibr" coords="1,351.98,411.86,12.76,9.94" target="#b0">[1]</ref>[2] task is to determine whether the two texts are written by the same author by comparing their writing styles. In earlier versions of PAN <ref type="bibr" coords="1,72.02,437.06,11.61,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the effectiveness of authorship verification techniques in multiple languages and text types was investigated. In recent years, cross-domain authorship verification tasks (cross-DT authorship verification) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,130.37,462.52,12.80,9.94" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have also been successfully implemented. The authorship verification task at PAN 2023, for the first time, focuses on authorship verification across spoken discourse genres. The aim is to investigate the effectiveness and robustness of style measurement methods under more challenging and intriguing circumstances. This task provides a cross-DT author verification case using a new English corpus of a diverse sample of approximately 100 native English speakers of similar ages (18-22). The subject of the text is not restricted. Still, the forms and levels of formality vary, including essays (written discourse), e-mails (written discourse), interviews (spoken discourse), and speech transcriptions (spoken discourse).</p><p>In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been widely adopted due to their superiority in processing large-scale datasets. Neural networks have had many practices for judging text author attribution <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.17,589.03,11.43,9.94" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Contractive learning <ref type="bibr" coords="1,240.82,589.03,12.80,9.94" target="#b4">[5]</ref> has gained increasing attention in deep learning, such as SimCSE <ref type="bibr" coords="1,113.57,601.75,11.61,9.94" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which can use labeled and unlabeled data to train deep neural networks to alleviate the challenges caused by data scarcity or inaccurate labels. In this authorship verification task, the lack of sufficient labeled datasets is a problem that needs to be solved, and comparative learning can improve the authentication performance of authorship verification by learning the similarity between tasks, to solve these problems better. The sentence vector representation technique has always been a hot topic in NLP. In the BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,169.99,664.89,12.80,9.94" target="#b6">[7]</ref> era, people generally used the [CLS] vector of the BERT model to represent the sentence vector by the inherent advantages of the pre-trained language model. In this paper, we apply BERT to obtain text representation, adopt contractive learning, and capture the author's writing style and characteristics by comparing the similarity between multiple texts of the same author. By experiment, we realized authorship verification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dataset</head><p>PAN@CLEF 2023 Authorship verification task belongs to the open set author verification. That is, the training data set and the test data set have the same structure and similar properties. However, there is no overlap in the author sets of training and test datasets. For the training set, there are 8836 text pairs from the Aston 100 Idiolects Corpus in English covering DTs of both written and spoken language: essays, emails, interviews, and speech transcriptions. Labels are given correspondingly, whose meaning is to judge whether the two texts are written by the same author (label 1 means yes, and vice versa is 0). To protect the author's privacy, information specific to both author and topic, such as named entities, have been substituted with corresponding tags. Moreover, for spoken discourse genres, supplementary tags are utilized to indicate nonverbal vocalizations, such as coughing and laughing.</p><p>Dataset distribution types and quantities are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,352.25,296.88,4.14,9.94">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>This section will introduce our data processing approach and network framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Preprocessing</head><p>For the training set given by the task, we first separated the texts according to each author. We randomly divided the texts according to 3:1 for the training set and the test set, including 42 and 14 different authors, respectively. For the training set, we make a text triplet (" pair ": [" text1 ", "text_pos," "text_neg"]), where " text_pos " indicates a positive sample, and " text_neg " indicates a negative sample. The positive samples are from the texts written by the author of the first text of the triplet, while the negative ones are from other authors.</p><p>The training set made of random combinations contains 22,090 pieces of data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Network Architecture</head><p>In this paper, the novel comparative learning framework SimCSE(Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding Framework) is adopted, and the pre-training language model BERT is used to extract text features. And the model parameters are constantly updated with training. Precisely, as for the BERT, the stacking Transformer encoder can capture deeply bidirectional information between words in a sentence. Take the hidden of the 0th position of hidden state in the last layer of output (that is, the hidden CLS, the vector of [CLS] tokens in the output layer) to represent the vector of the entire sentence. Directly using supervised training set for comparative learning training, the positive sentence pair can be regarded as a natural positive sample and regard other embedding in the same batch as negative samples. So, we can think of authorship verification as a binary classification problem <ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.13,112.72,11.63,9.94" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Note that the positive example of texti for each piece of data in the same batch is the only one, while all other examples in the batch are considered negative examples. However, if the batch contains two or more texts from the same author (for example, assuming Text1 and Text2 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,406.68,150.67,5.52,9.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref> were written by the same author), this may cause model confusion and performance degradation. Therefore, we scrambled the dataset to avoid the occurrence of the same authors in the same batch as much as possible, and we used a lower batch size further alleviates this issue.</p><p>The core of the SimCSE model is contractive learning, which aims to better learn the representation of the data by narrowing the distance between similar data and drawing the distance between dissimilar data. This makes it more effective in text-matching tasks. For each training data(𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑖 + , 𝑥 𝑖 -), where 𝑥 𝑖 + is the implied text and 𝑥 𝑖 -is the contradictory text. The training objective of supervised learning SimCSE is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,228.34,269.48,294.98,41.79">𝑙 𝑖 = -log 𝑒 sim(ℎ 𝑖 ,ℎ 𝑖 + )/𝜏 ∑ (𝑒 sim(ℎ 𝑖 ,ℎ 𝑗 + )/𝜏 +𝑒 sim(ℎ 𝑖 ,ℎ 𝑗 -)/𝜏 ) 𝑁 𝑗=1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where ℎ 𝑖 and ℎ 𝑖 + is the sentence vector representation of 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖 + , 𝑁 is the size of batch in the training process, sim(ℎ 𝑖 , ℎ 𝑗 + ) is the cosine similarity of vectors ℎ 𝑖 and ℎ 𝑖 + , and 𝜏 is the temperature hyperparameter.</p><p>The network architecture of the model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,341.87,360.96,4.14,9.94" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
