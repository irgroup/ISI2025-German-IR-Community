<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Authorship verification (pairwise) involves determining whether two documents were authored by the same individual. Traditionally, linguists have undertaken authorship verification to ascertain the authorship of anonymous texts by examining specific linguistic features. These features encompass a range of elements, such as errors (e.g. spelling mistakes), peculiarities in the text (e.g. grammatical inconsistencies), and patterns of writing style <ref type="bibr" coords="1,411.46,443.16,11.43,9.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Automated systems, particularly those based on machine learning, have heavily depended on stylometric features <ref type="bibr" coords="1,190.49,470.26,11.28,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These features are derived from linguistic metrics and are commonly used to analyze text. However, one limitation of stylometric features is that their effectiveness tends to decrease when applied to texts that exhibit significant variations in topics.</p><p>On the other hand, deep learning systems <ref type="bibr" coords="1,307.38,510.90,13.00,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> can be designed to autonomously learn neural features in a comprehensive manner. These features can be insensitive to the specific topic of the text. However, a drawback of such features is that they are generally not easily interpretable from a linguistic perspective.</p><p>In this study, we present a significant expansion of a popular and previously published ADHOMINEM method <ref type="bibr" coords="1,202.60,578.65,11.28,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In our extended approach, we not only analyze the neural features generated by ADHOMINEM using a metric perspective but also incorporate a stylometric viewpoint. This allows for a more comprehensive extraction of features from the documents. This paper is structured as follows: we will describe our approach in Section 2, present our evaluation results in Section 3 and discusses our conclusions and future work in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Approach</head><p>We pre-define a deep learning model architecture along with its hyper-parameters and thresholds and allow the model to autonomously learn suitable features for the provided setup. This approach is in line with most deep-learning methodologies. The success of our proposed setup heavily relies on the availability of a large collection of text samples that encompass diverse variations in writing style, enabling the model to learn effectively.</p><p>We utilize a predecessor of our ADHOMINEM system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.81,255.11,12.69,9.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> as a deep metric learning framework <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,268.66,12.72,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and document-level Stylometric features extractor to assess the similarity between two text samples. The concatenated features generated by the system are then inputted into a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) layer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.19,295.76,11.59,9.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This layer serves as a pairwise discriminator, conducting Bayes factor scoring within the learned metric space, thus contributing to the discriminative power of our method.1 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Neural extraction of linguistic embedding vectors (LEV) [5]</head><p>A text sample can be seen as a hierarchical structure composed of discrete elements arranged in a specific order. It starts with a list of sentences, where each sentence is comprised of an ordered sequence of tokens. Furthermore, each token consists of an ordered sequence of characters. The primary objective of ADHOMINEM is to transform a document into a feature vector. Specifically, its Siamese topology incorporates a hierarchical neural feature extraction process that captures the stylistic attributes of a pair of documents (D1, D2), which can have varying lengths. This process results in a pair of fixed-length linguistic embedding vectors (LEVs), denoted as 𝑦 𝑖</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,234.37,214.37,271.61,14.93">𝑦 𝑖 = 𝒜 𝜃 (𝒟 𝑖 ) ∈ ℝ 𝐷×1 , 𝑖 ∈ {1, 2}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>we denote the dimension of the linguistic embedding vectors (LEVs) as D, and 𝜃 represents all the trainable parameters involved. This network is referred to as a Siamese network because both documents 𝐷 1 and 𝐷 2 undergo mapping through the exact same function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stylometric features layer (SFL)</head><p>In this section, we outline the features, which are commonly utilized in previous stylometry research <ref type="bibr" coords="3,128.88,326.87,11.32,9.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We selected these features from the Writeprints feature set introduced by Weerasinghe <ref type="bibr" coords="3,118.20,340.42,11.59,9.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Additionally, recognizing the importance of the syntactic structure of sentences in providing informative signals to the classifier, we included POS-Tag n-grams and partial parses (or POS-Tag chunks) as part of our feature set, following the approach of previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,381.06,11.58,9.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Sidorov et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,176.61,381.06,13.00,9.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> introduced the use of parse trees for extracting stylometric features, specifically syntactic dependency-based n-grams of POS tags. However, we employed a slightly different method to encode parse tree features, which focuses on capturing the construction of different noun and verb phrases.</p><p>Furthermore, several features were computed based on TFIDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values. We utilized NLTK's TFIDFVectorizer to compute the TF-IDF vectors for the documents. To exclude tokens with a document frequency below 10%, we set the min token parameter to 0.1.</p><p>• C h a r a c t e r n -g r a m s : TF-IDF values for character n-grams, where 1 ≥ 𝑛 ≥ 6.</p><p>• P O S -T a g n -g r a m s : TF-IDF value of POS-Tag tri grams. • F r e q u e n c y o f F u n c t i o n W o r d s : Frequencies of 179 stopwords defined in the 𝑁 𝐿𝑇 𝐾 corpus package. • V o c a b R i c h n e s s : computed by dividing the combined count of words that appear only once (hapax-legomenon) and words that appear twice (dis-legomenon) in the document, by the total number of tokens in the document. This normalization accounts for variations in document lengths. After concatenating the above features, we use truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensions from 8708 to 10 dimensions before concatenating with LEVs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Bayes factor scoring [10]</head><p>Text samples exhibit significant variations, making it valuable to employ statistical hypothesis tests to quantify the outputs or scores generated by our algorithm. These tests aid in determining whether to accept or reject a decision. ADHOMINEM has the potential to incorporate a framework for conducting statistical hypothesis testing. Specifically, we focus on the authorship verification (AV) problem, where we are presented with the linguistic embedding vectors (LEVs) and Stylometric features layer (SFL) of two documents. We concatenate them into combined layers (CLs) and then make a decision based on one of two hypotheses:</p><p>• ℋ 𝑠 : The two documents were written by the same person, • ℋ 𝑑 : The two documents were written by two different persons.</p></div>

In the verification phase, the model is utilized to determine whether the two text samples originate from the same author based on the learned parameters as shown in Eq. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,268.17,155.84,10.48,9.74" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="5,120.91,185.15,385.08,61.86">score (𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 ) = log 𝑝 (𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 | ℋ 𝑠 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 | ℋ 𝑑 ) = log 𝑝 (𝑥 0 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑥 1 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑥 2 ) + log 𝑝 (𝑦 1 | 𝑥 0 ) + log 𝑝 (𝑦 2 | 𝑥 0 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑦 1 | 𝑥 1 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑦 2 | 𝑥 2 ) -log 𝑝 (𝑥 0 | 𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 ) + log 𝑝 (𝑥 1 | 𝑦 1 ) + log 𝑝 (𝑥 2 | 𝑦 2 )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>A higher value for 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 ) indicates higher similarity and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Training Details</head><p>We implemented our training algorithm in Python. We conducted our preprocessing in our customized regular expression function and then use spaCy 𝑒𝑛_𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒_𝑤𝑒𝑏_𝑙𝑔 to do sentence boundary detection and tokenization. Given that the stylometric part of the model is set and described, we fine-tuned our deep Bayesian model to achieve higher performance. However, none of the fine-tuning trials' performance exceeds the default hyper-parameters model. Details are as follows: • l e a r n i n g r a t e e n d : 0.0002 • l e a r n i n g r a t e s t a r t : 0.0006</p><p>For the final submitted model in Tira <ref type="bibr" coords="5,264.16,643.61,16.09,9.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we used the entire training dataset with the above hyper-parameters setting and combined stylometric layers outputs to train the deep Bayesian model. We took epoch number 8, 24, and 35 for our final three submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation</head><p>The following table presents the experimental results conducted on the competition dataset. The dataset was divided into train and test sets for evaluation purposes. In our analysis, we compared the performance metrics provided by the PAN competition with two baseline models, our predecessor the deep metric model (DML, a model that directly learns from LEV <ref type="bibr" coords="6,468.19,153.05,11.14,9.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), and the uncertainty adaptation layer model (UAL, which models the noise behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="6,446.08,166.60,15.77,9.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), and the Bayes factor scoring model (BFS) with/without Stylometric features layer(SFL). The experimental results indicate that the incorporation of the Stylometric Features Layer (SFL) significantly improves the performance of the ADHOMINEM model. Among the various configurations of the ADHOMINEM model, the Bayes factor scoring (BFS) model consistently outperforms the others across all evaluated metrics. These findings suggest that the integration of the SFL enhances the ability of the AD-HOMINEM model to capture relevant stylometric characteristics, leading to improved authorship verification results. The superiority of the BFS model further highlights the effectiveness of the Bayesian factor scoring approach in selecting discriminative features for distinguishing between different authors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have introduced a novel approach to authorship verification (AV) that combines neural feature extraction and stylometric features with statistical modeling. The observed performance improvements affirm the value of the proposed enhancements in the ADHOMINEM model, emphasizing the significance of the feature selection technique and the utilization of stylometric features for the authorship verification task.</p><p>In AV, there are numerous factors that introduce variabilities, such as topic, genre, text length and text types, which can negatively impact the performance of the system. However, we believe that there is significant potential for further improvements by incorporating compensation techniques to address these aspects in future challenges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,644.94,108.61,8.91;2,105.64,344.42,384.00,288.00"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Model structure</figDesc><graphic coords="2,105.64,344.42,384.00,288.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
