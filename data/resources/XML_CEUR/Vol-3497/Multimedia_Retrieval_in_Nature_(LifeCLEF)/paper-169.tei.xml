<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper outlines the participation in the LifeCLEF-SnakeCLEF 2023 challenge for automated identification of snake species. A metric-weighted ensemble loss function was introduced. The proposed loss function was put to test with various deep learning architectures, including Data Efficient Image Transformers (DEiT), EfficientNet and DinoV2. The SnakeCLEF 2023 challenge offers a substantial database comprised of images and associated recording locations for 1,784 snake species, serving as a resource to address this identification problem. The DEiT model trained with proposed loss outperformed the EfficientNetB0 model trained with focal loss by 49% in terms of the F1 score (macro). In the context of the SnakeCLEF2023 challenge, highest F1 score (macro) of 0.36 was achieved. Notably, our experiments forego the usage of metadata such as region or country, focusing solely on image based classification. The development of such a system holds significant potential to reduce snakebite induced mortality and morbidity, aligning closely with global health and biodiversity objectives.</p></div>

Ophidian envenomation predominantly impacts individuals in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Asia alone witnesses up to 2 million cases <ref type="bibr" coords="1,184.59,527.21,12.99,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> of snake venom intoxication annually.

Moreover, the knowledge about the geographical distribution of various snake species is far from complete. It is not uncommon for the majority of images of a particular snake species to come from a small group of countries or even a single country which in turn bias the model and model trained on snake species in one region is not detected in another region because of environmental difference causing the difference in the appearance. On the other hand, several snake species resemble species from other continents, with which they share no overlap in their geographic distribution.</p></div>

These images represent 1,784 unique snake species sighted across 214 countries. The data was gathered from online biodiversity platforms, namely iNaturalist and Herpmapper. It is important to note that the provided dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tailed class distribution, with the most frequently observed species, Natrix Natrix, represented by 1,262 observations (encompassing 2,079 images), while the least observed species have merely 3 recorded observations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,331.29,619.81,11.37,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This dataset also includes metadata that is country code and name of the species. This dataset is bifurcated into two components, serving as training data where one part includes commonly observed species, while the other contains data pertaining to rarer snake species. Note that in this work, the metadata is not included to maintain simplicity and considering the scenario when metadata might not be available.</p><p>As displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,200.12,404.60,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the bar plot representing absolute class frequencies, the distribution of snake species in the dataset exhibits a pronounced imbalance. Despite the considerable size of this dataset, it contains numerous challenging examples that make classification a daunting task. For instance, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,203.77,445.25,5.07,10.91" target="#fig_2">2</ref> presents images of snakes demonstrating a significant variation in the surfaces on which they are found and some snake species are less distinguishable w.r.t the surface itself. These variations further complicate the classification process. The mathematical formulation of Focal Loss is -</p></div>

In the observations mentioned in Lin et al., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,195.08,190.18,14.74,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, when an example is misclassified and 𝑝 𝑡 is small, the modulating factor is near 1 and the loss is unaffected. As 𝑝 𝑡 → 1, the factor goes to 0 and the loss for well-classified examples is down-weighted. Also, the focusing parameter 𝛾 smoothly adjusts the rate at which easy examples are downweighted.</p><p>Another variation of Focal loss, Equalized focal loss <ref type="bibr" coords="5,336.13,244.38,16.38,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, on the other hand, was designed to address another imbalance, which is the within-class sample imbalance, a common issue in long-tailed classification problems. In a multi-class classification setting, applying a single modulating factor uniformly across all classes (as done in focal loss) might not be the best approach, especially when there is a large class imbalance. This is because the modulating factor does not take into account the relative frequency of the classes in the dataset. In this type of problem, some classes have a lot more examples than others. Equalized focal loss tries to mitigate the issue by estimating class-wise weights to balance the influence of each class. This makes the model focus more on the under represented classes. The Equalized focal loss for the j-th category as-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,220.28,390.20,286.36,14.58">𝐸𝐹 𝐿(𝑝 𝑡 ) = -𝛼 𝑡 (1 -𝑝 𝑡 ) 𝛾 𝑗 log(𝑝 𝑡 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here, 𝛼 𝑡 and 𝑝 𝑡 are identical to those in the original focal loss. The parameter 𝛾 𝑗 acts as the focusing factor for the j-th category, paralleling the role of 𝛾 in traditional focal loss. As mentioned in Lin et al., <ref type="bibr" coords="5,195.17,440.54,14.75,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, varying values of 𝛾 correspond to different degrees of imbalance between positive and negative instances. For rare categories positive-negative imbalance, a larger 𝛾 𝑗 is employed. In cases of categories with minor imbalance, a smaller 𝛾 𝑗 is suitable. In equalised focal loss <ref type="bibr" coords="5,193.53,481.19,16.41,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the focusing factor 𝛾 𝑗 is decomposed into two parts, namely, a category-agnostic parameter 𝛾 𝑏 and a category-specific parameter 𝛾 𝑗 𝑣 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,268.48,517.48,238.16,14.19">𝛾 𝑗 = 𝛾 𝑏 + 𝛾 𝑗 𝑣<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Here, 𝛾 𝑏 signifies the focusing factor in a balanced data scenario, regulating the fundamental behavior of the classifier. On the other hand, 𝛾 𝑗 𝑣 ≥ 0 is a variable parameter tied to the imbalance degree of the j-th category. It dictates the extent to which the learning focus is on addressing positive-negative imbalance issues.</p><p>In this paper, both loss functions are utilized. As mentioned in Eq.( <ref type="formula" coords="5,389.65,597.95,3.94,10.91" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), focal loss equally treats the learning of all categories with the same modulating factor, so it is element-wise multiplied with the weights obtained by the metric mentioned in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,339.81,625.05,11.48,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,354.40,625.05,9.03,10.91" target="#b8">9]</ref> for Metric Weighted Ensemble Focal Loss.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Sampling Strategy</head><p>In a normal random sampling scenario, every data point in the dataset has an equal chance of being included in a batch. This can cause problems if the dataset is imbalanced, which is our case, meaning some classes have more samples than others. If a model is trained on these batches, it might perform poorly on the under represented classes simply because it didn't see enough of those examples during training. This is where WeightedRandomSampler <ref type="bibr" coords="6,276.10,397.10,17.75,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref> is used in this paper. It assigns each data point in the dataset a weight. The probability that a data point gets included in a batch is proportional to its weight. The idea of weighted random sampling is a general statistical technique which uses multinomial distribution for sampling and is not tied to a specific paper or proposal. That said, many papers in machine learning that deal with imbalanced datasets will make use of weighted sampling or similar techniques e.g., Learning from Imbalanced Data by He and Garcia <ref type="bibr" coords="6,487.15,464.85,16.41,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Please note that paper, Learning from Imbalanced Data <ref type="bibr" coords="6,336.79,478.40,16.24,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, discusses a variety of techniques, not just weighted sampling.</p><p>The mathematical steps for the WeightedRandomSampler as mentioned in pytorch are-</p><p>• Normalize the weights to create a discrete probability distribution-</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="6,244.00,545.51,262.64,27.08">𝑃 (𝑖) = 𝑤 𝑖 ∑︀ 𝑗 𝑤 𝑗 ∀𝑗 ∈ dataset<label>(6)</label></formula><p>• Then, draw a sample index i from the discrete distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="6,291.74,605.86,214.90,10.91">𝑖 ∼ 𝑃 (𝑖)<label>(7)</label></formula><p>• The final output is a sequence of indices, with a total length equal to to the sampled data points. It's worth noting that because this sampling process is inherently probabilistic, different runs will generally yield different results unless a consistent random seed is used.  Before feeding the images into the model, they are pre-processed using a saliency-based object detection method proposed by Rail Chamidullin in 2022, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,339.34,288.38,16.34,10.91">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,358.41,288.38,12.26,10.91" target="#b35">37]</ref>. Given the challenging nature of the dataset, where differentiating a snake from its surrounding environment can be arduous, this process proves beneficial. By eliminating irrelevant sections of the image, the model is more likely to focus on the features of the snake, thus enhancing its performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Exploring Different Architectural Designs Through Experimentation</head><p>In order to address this imabalanced data classification task, a series of experiments were conducted. These experiments included DEiT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,291.01,419.40,16.10,10.91" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, EfficientNets <ref type="bibr" coords="7,372.76,419.40,16.10,10.91" target="#b37">[39]</ref>, and DinoV2 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,450.19,419.40,16.11,10.91" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. Among these, DEiT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,143.44,432.95,17.90,10.91" target="#b36">[38]</ref> emerged as the most proficient when using an input image size of 384 × 384.</p><p>An exploratory analysis involving DinoV2 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,280.01,446.50,17.92,10.91" target="#b38">[40]</ref> was also conducted, primarily focusing on the PCA <ref type="bibr" coords="7,112.55,460.05,17.91,10.91" target="#b39">[41]</ref> features, as exhibited in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,272.49,460.05,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_7">5</ref>.</p><p>These figures demonstrate the model's adeptness at learning accurate features. Additionally, DinoV2 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,127.36,487.15,18.06,10.91" target="#b38">[40]</ref> was trained for a single epoch, a process that took approximately two and a half hours, yet yielded a commendable macro F1 score at first pass than other experimented models. This performance surpassed the first epoch results of other models. However, due to the substantial time consumption, this model was not further pursued in the current study. Nonetheless, its promising initial results mark it as a potentially worthwhile experiment for future research. These models were trained using the proposed loss function. Individually focal loss <ref type="bibr" coords="7,108.91,568.44,17.91,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and equalized focal loss <ref type="bibr" coords="7,237.40,568.44,17.91,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref> were also being utilized for training experiments.</p><p>The GPUs utilized for this research were the A6000 48 GiB GPU with 45 GiB RAM from Paperspace and the A100 from Colab. It is significant to mention that due to limited resources, the number of training epochs was kept under 30. Apart from the Metric Weighted Ensemble Focal Loss (MWEFL), other loss functions such as the Equalized Focal Loss <ref type="bibr" coords="7,428.02,622.64,17.71,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>(eFocal) were also explored.    </p></div>

Each model is evaluated on three distinct metrics -F1 score (macro), snake score (a custom metric employed as a weight in our MWEFL loss function and introduced in the challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="8,135.42,503.65,11.48,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,149.78,503.65,7.40,10.91" target="#b8">9]</ref>), and top-3 accuracy. The tabulated results provide a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture in tackling the given classification task. Despite the fact that the highest macro F1-score was achieved by the DEiT model trained using eFocal loss (F1-score (macro) 0.36), the DEiT model trained with MWEFL (F1-score (macro) 0.35) outperformed the others in terms of the lowest snake score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>The research conducted in this study involved numerous experiments, which could be further improved with access to a larger and more balanced dataset and by running more epochs. Specifically, for those species with a smaller number of samples, one could artificially boost their representation through offline augmentation techniques.</p><p>Another promising direction for future work could be to treat this problem as a similarity search task. In this approach, we could construct a database of embeddings for different appearances of all species. Then, for a new image, we calculate the similarity score between the new image and the images in the database. This method could potentially make the model more robust and improve its accuracy by leveraging a more comprehensive understanding of the variability in appearances among species.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,97.36,158.34,171.07,9.96;2,318.18,158.34,187.81,9.96"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) Distribution of Train Dataset Class IDs (b) Distribution of Rare Train Dataset Class IDs</figDesc></figure>

Focal loss was introduced in the paper Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection by Lin et al.,[32] as a way to address the class imbalance issue in object detection. It was designed to address the one-stage object detection scenario in which there is an extreme imbalance between foreground and background classes during training. The central idea of the focal loss is to reduce the contribution of well classified examples, allowing the training process to focus more on hard examples. This is achieved by adding a modulating factor (1 -𝑝 𝑡 ) 𝛾 to the cross entropy loss, with tunable focusing parameter 𝛾 ≥ 0, that decreases the weight of well-classified examples.</figDesc></figure>
