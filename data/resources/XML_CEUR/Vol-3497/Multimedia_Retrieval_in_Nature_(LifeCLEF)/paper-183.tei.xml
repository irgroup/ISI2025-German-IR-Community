<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Plant identification has received a significant improvement in recent years with the development of deep learning. However, large-scale plant identifications still suffer such as the PlantCLEF2022 challenge, and this paper aims to address this issue in the PlantCLEF2023 challenge. On one hand, we extend an effective strategy, transfer learning, resorting to advanced pretrained methods with multi-modal and self-supervised learning. On the other hand, training dataset size and quality are probed and their impacts are compared to one of the advanced pretrained methods. The experimental results suggest that advanced pretrained methods, bigger datasets, and noisy datasets are beneficial to plant identification. Especially, the performance gain from the first one is inferior to the counterparts of the latter two, with the dataset in the PlantCLEF2023 challenge. For example, employing a noisy dataset together receives 0.0236 gains in performance whereas multimodal and self-supervised pretraining contributes 0.00792 gains. We hope that our results highlight the importance of collecting better datasets for plant identification. Our codes are public at https://github.com/xml94/PlantCLEF2022.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Plant identification is an essential task in plant science, such as for maintaining biodiversity and finding new plant species, which traditionally requires the involvement of human experts. Because of the limitation of experts, plant identification is often not convenient and expensive. Besides, it is also difficult to integrate the identification with other tasks. Resorting to RGB images and computer vision methods, plant identification has achieved a significant improvement in recent years. A commonly embraced paradigm is taking plant identification from the computer vision community, with a basic inspiration that plants images resemble the images in general computer vision tasks such as ImageNet-1k <ref type="bibr" coords="1,285.10,591.99,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Holding the paradigm, the methods and techniques in general computer vision tasks are overwhelmingly borrowed to plant identification. Transfer learning is proven as one of the most successful strategies, which directly adopts the models trained in the datasets from general computer vision tasks. This paper extends this idea one more step by using advanced pretrained methods. To be specific, a ViT-large model pretrained in multi-modal and self-supervised is fine-tuned in the PlantCLEF2023 dataset. Multi-modal refers to using inputs in different modality <ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.29,168.26,11.47,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.49,168.26,7.51,10.91" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.74,168.26,7.64,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>, such as text and image <ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.32,168.26,11.56,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, by which more semantics are learned, whereas self-supervised learning denotes a set of training strategies without using labels. One of the most successful self-supervised learning methods is predicting the masked contents from the original inputs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.55,208.91,11.26,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.54,208.91,7.44,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.71,208.91,7.51,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of the pretraining with multi-modal and masked image modeling in the context of plant identification.</p><p>Simultaneously, we aim to point out the heterogeneity between general computer vision and plant identification and argue that plant identification has its specificity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.97,249.56,11.58,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For example, a plant may be very similar to another plant. However, this heterogeneity should receive more attention ranging from dataset collecting and algorithm designing, although some existing papers cast plant identification into a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we aim to probe the impact of size and quality of training datasets to identify plant species, and compare the impacts to the one with advanced pretraining methods. We emphasize that the comparison is our ultimate objective, rather than probing training dataset alone, in that scaling laws, enlarging capacities of models and sizes of training datasets, already suggests its power in natural language processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,357.95,11.36,10.91" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,103.37,357.95,12.55,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,118.65,357.95,14.03,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref> and computer vision <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.63,357.95,11.36,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.71,357.95,12.32,10.91" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>Through experiments in PlantCLEF2023, we found that advanced pretraining methods slightly contribute to plant identification, and a bigger dataset and noisy datasets may be more beneficial. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,174.51,398.60,3.76,10.91">4</ref>, employing noisy datasets together receives 0.0236 gains in performance whereas multimodal and self-supervised pretraining contributes 0.00792 improvements. Based on this observation, we think that collecting a better dataset and analyzing the challenges within a collected dataset should receive more attention.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Datasets</head><p>Trusted and Web datasets. The PlantCLEF2023 challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.68,518.84,16.55,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,381.01,518.84,14.11,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref> adopts the same dataset as PlantCLEF2022 and the dataset officially consists of three parts, Trusted, Web, and Test. We summarize some details and our analysis and understanding in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,420.63,545.94,3.80,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The Trusted and Web datasets have labels and can be utilized to train proposed models but their reliabilities are different. The Trusted dataset is annotated by experts whereas the Web one is collected from the internet with some other post-processes to improve the quality.</p><p>We aim to analyze the Trusted and Web datasets and found distinct characteristics. First, the two datasets are both in heavy class-imbalance where some classes have much more number of images than other classes as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,339.19,627.23,5.02,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="2,392.48,627.23,5.02,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="2,419.19,627.23,3.70,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, which may result in lower performance for the classes with less number of images <ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.86,640.78,16.09,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Second, the datasets have huge intra-class variation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.70,654.33,16.30,10.91" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.60,654.33,13.95,10.91" target="#b14">15]</ref> in two factors: a plant species has multiple organs, such as flowers and leaves; and images from an organ may have heterogeneity, such as multiscale and growth stage as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,238.95,573.22,3.79,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Third, the datasets have relatively less number of images averaged by the classes and can be cast as a few-shot classification. For example, the Trusted and Web datasets have approximately 36 and 18 images on average for each class. Through our observation, the difference between the Trusted and Web datasets may be the distribution of the number of images in one species, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,422.32,627.41,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Several random observations suggest that most of the images in the Web dataset are correctly annotated. Therefore, the two datasets are combined as a potential training dataset with much more images and less impact of class imbalance <ref type="bibr" coords="3,243.86,668.06,16.25,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test dataset and observation</head><p>The Test dataset has no public labels and is formally adopted to evaluate different methods. It has 55,306 images for 26,868 individual plants, termed observations where a plant may have multiple images. According to the official report <ref type="bibr" coords="4,409.60,572.48,16.09,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the images cover 7,339 plant species, less than the total numbers in the Trusted and Web datasets, but the exact information is not accessible. The observation-level classification requires the ability to make decisions considering multiple predictions from a model, which may be beneficial to have higher performance to recognize plant species. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Evaluation metric</head><p>Macro averaged mean reciprocal rank (MA-MRR) is utilized to evaluate different submissions for the PlantCLEF2022 challenge. The challenge requests a submission with a rank based on the score with a given length for each testing observation, and the rank is thirty for the challenge. Assume there are 𝑁 classes in the testing dataset and class 𝑛 has 𝑂 𝑛 observations. Mathematically, MA-MRR can be formalized as 1,2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,218.76,595.35,287.22,33.74">𝑀 𝐴 -𝑀 𝑅𝑅 = 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛=1 1 𝑂 𝑛 𝑂𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 1 𝑟 𝑖 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝑟 𝑖 refers to the rank position of the first relevant ground-truth label for the 𝑖-th observation from one class. Conceptually, if all of the observations are classified correctly in the first, then MA-MRR is one where the accuracy is hundred percent. In contrast, if MA-MRR is smaller then the model is worse. Intuitively, the observation level enables us to observe different parts of plants, while MA-MRR allows more than one chance to recognize plant species for a specific image, 30 chances in the PlantCLEF2023 challenge. In general, MA-MRR is slightly higher than the actual accuracy, a widely used metric to evaluate image classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>In this section, a combination method for observation-level image classification is first described. Second, our two main strategies, relevant to and fine-tuning, for the PlantCLEFF2022 challenge introduced. Our results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,369.41,460.93,3.74,10.91">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Strategy towards observation</head><p>Let 𝑟 𝑗 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 denote the testing probability score rank of the 𝑗-th image of one observation. Similarly, 𝑟 𝑗 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 is the testing class rank with the same length. Besides, 𝑟 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖 and 𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑖 are the 𝑖-th class-score pair and mean the class and the corresponding probability score, respectively. The rank requires 𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑝 &gt; 𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑞 if 𝑝 ∈ R + &lt; 𝑞 ∈ R + . A final desired output {𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 , 𝑟 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 }, pair of class and corresponding score can be formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,201.52,586.79,304.46,15.82">{𝑟 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 , 𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 } = {(∪ 𝑛 𝑗=1 ({𝑟 𝑗 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 , 𝑟 𝑗 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 })),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where { means an integration function and the observation has 𝑛 corresponding images. ∪ suggests the union of the 𝑛 images. Following our observation in the last year <ref type="bibr" coords="6,295.83,640.97,16.41,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the multi-sorted method contributes to a relatively higher performance, where multi means that the final rank pair is from multiple images, rather than a single image, and sorted means that the predicted species with higher Table <ref type="table" coords="7,116.06,90.49,5.12,8.93">4</ref> Our official results, the best showing in the boldface. We fine-tune the models in the PlantCLEF2023 dataset. Except for run 9 and 10, fine-tuned by 10 and 50 epochs respectively, all models are fine-tuned by 100 epochs, following MAE. Same with our last year's experiment <ref type="bibr" coords="7,367.89,126.40,14.79,8.87" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we executed the experiments with the code of MAE, which means the same training strategies. The Trusted and Web datasets are short as T and W. The number after num suggests the statistics term. For example, T@num36 denotes the images from the classes with exact or more than 36 images. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,345.60,162.27,15.99,8.87">MAE</ref> probabilities after sorting all predictions from all images aligning to the same observation are adopted to evaluate. With the multi-sorted strategy, the scores of all images from the same observation are sorted: 𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑡(∪ 𝑛 𝑗=1 ∪ 𝑙 𝑖=1 𝑟 𝑗 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑖 ) where 𝑙 is the length of the ranges (30 in the PlantCLEF2023 challenge); and then, after removing duplicates of same classes, the first required length of class-score pair are taken as the final ranking pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Advanced pretraining models</head><p>As mentioned before, the PlantCLEF2023 challenge can be recognized as a few-shot image classification. Even if the Trusted and Web datasets are combined, each class has only about 50 images on average, much less than the counterpart in the ImageNet <ref type="bibr" coords="7,388.35,523.52,12.71,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> dataset. To address this issue, employing a pretrained model is one of the most effective and efficient methods across many different tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="7,179.39,550.62,16.30,10.91" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,197.77,550.62,12.23,10.91" target="#b14">15]</ref>, especially in the eras of large language models such as ChatGPT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,493.30,550.62,12.68,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and foundation models <ref type="bibr" coords="7,192.27,564.17,11.28,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

We employed MAE with ViT-large <ref type="bibr" coords="7,361.05,618.36,18.07,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> model in the last year and obtained a first place for the PlantCLEF2022 challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="7,325.72,631.91,16.08,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Another widely adopted pretraining strategy involves multi-modal, such as CLIP <ref type="bibr" coords="7,288.17,645.46,11.44,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, in which the learning loss is to maximize the relationships between paired text and images and minimize the counterparts of the unpaired  <ref type="bibr" coords="8,221.99,269.44,12.14,8.87" target="#b5">[6]</ref>,can be adopted as pre-training method without using annotations. ones.

In this way, a vision model in MVP can learn more semantics from the frozen CLIP image encoder that is pretrained in 400 million image-text pairs. Furthermore, as highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,198.32,556.58,3.76,10.91" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, EVA <ref type="bibr" coords="9,230.92,556.58,12.88,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> scales MVP by using bigger models with more parameters and more datasets, by which better performance is achieved across different downstream tasks.</p><p>Inspired by the success of EVA, we extend it from general computer vision tasks to plant species identification on a large scale. Because of the limitation of GPUs, we only consider the scaling of EVA with more datasets and the model architecture is still ViT-large <ref type="bibr" coords="9,432.49,610.77,16.09,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Specifically, EVA-L pretrained in ImageNet-21k, rather than ImageNet-1k, is leveraged, which is denoted EVA-IN21k. We also utilized its finetuned version, finetuned once more in ImageNet-21k in a supervised manner, mainly because it has better performance in ImageNet-1k and empirically, a model with higher performance in ImageNet-1k may have a better performance in the target dataset with transfer learning strategy <ref type="bibr" coords="10,265.72,86.97,16.39,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This pretrained model is denoted as EVA-IN21k-IN21k.</p><p>As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,190.64,114.06,3.81,10.91">4</ref>, EVA-IN21k pretrained model outperforms MAE-IN1k slightly and EVA-IN21k-IN21k has also a tiny improvement. Our results suggest that better pretrained models and better performance in ImageNet-1k may have superiority in plant identification, same observations in <ref type="bibr" coords="10,185.78,154.71,16.25,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Bigger training dataset</head><p>Considering that the Trusted dataset has 80,000 classes but the Test dataset only has 7,339 classes, training models in the whole Trusted dataset seems a waste of computing resources. A desired strategy is to find the class in the Test dataset and then just use the corresponding images in the Trusted dataset. However, the desired classes are not given. Instead, we assume that the frequencies of plant species in the Trusted and Test datasets are similar. Therefore, we just choose the classes from the Trusted dataset based on the number of samples. For example, those classes having 100 images or more are selected, denoted as T@num100, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,89.04,299.28,3.74,10.91">4</ref>.</p><p>To our surprise, the test performance monotonically shrinks when the number of images reduces. Especially, training the model in the whole Trusted dataset leads to the best performance. We emphasize that this phenomenon may result from two factors: the number of images and the number of classes. When the number of images increases, some classes in the Test dataset may be included. However, these classes just have a few images, such as less than 7 if the training dataset replaces T@num7 with T.</p><p>We further directly utilized the Web dataset along with the Trusted because of our previous observation that the main difference is the frequency as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,411.93,407.68,3.70,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The corresponding performance is further improved by 3.6% than using the Trusted alone. As the Web dataset is assumed to have noise, the trained model with the Trusted and Web datasets undergoes fine-tuning once more, 10 and 50 epochs as run ID 9 and 10 respectively. We are shocked that the performance degrades with the fine-tuning process. We conjecture that most of the images in the Web dataset are labeled correctly.</p><p>We emphasize that the experiment to change the training datasets is not trivial in that it resembles the process in real applications. The test scenario is not always fully understood and the training dataset is getting bigger gradually when projects continue. Sometimes, a training dataset may be along with noisy labels, and the strategies to use them should be further considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Discussion</head><p>Transfer learning and its advanced version are slightly beneficial for plant identification. Transfer learning has contributed to many tasks and our work proves that advanced transfer learning, such as foundation models, has an extra contribution. Therefore, utilizing a better pretrained model is one of the potential strategies. But we emphasize that it may also hinder performance such as when the labeled data in the target task is scarce <ref type="bibr" coords="10,471.20,647.09,16.55,10.91" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,491.11,647.09,12.42,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Simultaneously, foundation models may also suffer when the distributions of the source dataset to pretrain a model and the target dataset is diverse <ref type="bibr" coords="11,329.30,86.97,16.41,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. As far as we know, the images of PlantCLEF2023 are far different from the datasets, ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, to pretrain MAE and EVA models. New methods to leverage the pretrained model are the potential to make further improvements.</p><p>Collecting a better dataset is still promising for plant identification. In the Plant-CLEF2023 challenge, the Trusted and Web datasets are both in heavy class imbalance and some classes of the datasets have only one or two images. Our experimental results suggest that more data make better performance, even if some noisy data are leveraged directly. Compared to the gains from transfer learning methods and bigger datasets, we believe that collecting a bigger dataset could be more effective.</p><p>Limitations and social impacts. Our experiments have used enormous computing resources although we obtained a decent record for the challenge. To be honest, we used 16 RTX 3090 GPUs for almost three months. It is actually not fair to other teams without enough GPUs. On the other hand, we hope our analysis and understandings are useful for the community, such as dataset analysis and the comparison between transfer learning and bigger dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We first analyzed the given datasets in the PlantCLEF2023 challenge and found that class imbalance and huge intra-class variation are the main characteristics. Simultaneously, the challenge can be taken from a few-shot perspective. Furthermore, the Trusted and Web datasets are compared, with an observation that their image distribution is much different and the noise in the Web dataset may be exaggerated. Two strategies are executed for the challenge, different pretrained models and different sizes of the training dataset. Both strategies contribute and, even with noisy data, a bigger training dataset is more beneficial to the challenge. We hope that our results highlight the importance of collecting bigger datasets for plant identification. Simultaneously, we emphasize the heterogeneity between plant identification and general computer vision.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,235.45,416.69,8.93;4,89.29,247.46,381.95,8.87;4,407.55,158.37,59.98,58.38"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Images of Aralia nudicaulis L. species from PlantCLEF2022 Trusted dataset.
