<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has always been a significant direction in computer vision. This paper describes our solution for the SnakeCLEF2023 competition. Firstly, we employ the MetaFormer architecture to process both the meta information and image information of the data. Secondly, we utilize ArcFace loss to address the issue of imbalanced data distribution. Next, we leverage the SimCLR contrastive learning method to allow the model to fully utilize the information from the dataset. Lastly, we employ data preprocessing techniques to enhance accuracy. Our approach achieved 88.30% on the private-score-track1 and 1613 on the private-score-track2, securing the third position.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The human eye is an extraordinary organ capable of not only distinguishing broad categories of objects such as bikes, cats, and dogs but also further classifying them into specific subcategories like Garfield cats, Tabby cats, British Shorthair blue cats, and so on. The process of distinguishing different subcategories of cats within the broader category of cats is known as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC). After the rapid development of computer vision, people have attempted to use computer vision instead of human eyes for fine-grained visual classification.</p><p>FGVC has applications in our daily lives, industries, and businesses. For example, when taking a photograph of a bird, this technology can be utilized to identify the species of the bird <ref type="bibr" coords="1,110.49,556.32,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. When capturing an image of a car, this technology can be utilized to determine its brand, model, production year, and other relevant details <ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.61,569.87,11.29,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. FGVC technology is continuously evolving and holds the potential for even more applications in the future. FGVC faces several challenges. Challenge 1: Large intra-class variations. Individuals within the same class can exhibit significant differences in appearance. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,457.24,293.65,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the adult and sub-adult plumages of the Red-crowned Crane have distinct coloration <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.88,307.20,13.23,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Challenge 2: Small inter-class variations. Individuals within the different classes are very similar or closely related in certain aspects. For example, the Coral Snake and the Milk Snake have striking similarities in their appearance, both having bodies with black, red, and yellow bands. Their colors and patterns are almost identical, except for the arrangement of bands. This competition is the SnakeCLEF2023 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.67,374.95,15.96,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> competition in LifeCLEF2023 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,332.34,374.95,14.76,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.84,374.95,7.63,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>, which focuses on snake species classification, both humans and machines face difficulties due to the large intra-class variations and small inter-class variations in snake appearances. To distinguish them, it is necessary to learn features from the head shape, body shape, appearance, skin texture, and eye structure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.59,415.59,11.31,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>FGVC methods can be divided into two categories: methods that only use image information and methods that incorporate meta information, such as geographic location, gender, and shape.</p><p>Using only image information. The mentioned network structures proposed various approaches for image recognition. CMAL-Net <ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.24,151.93,12.99,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduced a cross-layer mutual attention learning network that enabled the model to focus on discriminative regions. Yong Hou et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,493.30,165.48,12.68,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed a multilayer feature descriptors fusion CNN model that considered both second-order and first-order local feature descriptors from different layers. P-CNN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.83,192.57,17.95,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> employed a system consisting of three modules: Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, Part Localization Network (PLN), and Part Classification Network (PCN) to enhance fine-grained classification performance. RA-CNN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,129.92,233.22,17.76,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a novel recurrent attention convolutional neural network that recursively learned discriminative region attention and region-based feature representation at multiple scales. MRA-CNN <ref type="bibr" coords="3,176.25,260.32,18.06,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> improved RA-CNN by incorporating associations between multiple feature regions. It also introduced a feature scale-dependent (FSD) algorithm to select optimal features as input for the classifier. These network structures proposed different approaches and techniques.</p><p>Moving on to snake image recognition, Amiza Amir et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,368.75,314.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed an image-based method for the automatic identification of snake species, achieving an accuracy of 87%. However, it was limited to identifying only 22 species of snakes. Z. Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,406.64,341.62,18.07,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed using a detection network to identify the snake's area before classifying its species. Due to limited training data, it could only distinguish 11 snake species. Patel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,376.12,368.71,17.75,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> modified and successfully implemented four region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) architectures for image classification, achieving an overall accuracy rate of around 75%.</p><p>Using mata information. Incorporating meta-information has proven effective. Zhai et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,422.91,18.04,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a joint graph regularized heterogeneous metric learning (JGRHML) algorithm that integrated the structure of different media using joint graph regularization. Geo-Aware <ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.22,436.46,17.76,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> systematically investigated various ways of incorporating geolocation information into finegrained image classification, such as geolocation priors, post-processing, or feature modulation. CVL <ref type="bibr" coords="3,112.94,477.11,18.06,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a two-stream model combining vision and language (CVL) for learning latent semantic representations. The visual stream learned deep features using convolutional neural networks, while the language stream utilized natural language descriptions to indicate distinctive parts or features of each image. The language stream provided a flexible and compact encoding method for salient visual aspects, aiding in the discrimination of subcategories. These models incorporated meta-information in different ways.</p><p>Regarding snake image recognition with meta-information, Bloch L et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,415.14,558.40,17.76,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> utilized YOLOv5 as a detection network and incorporated meta-information such as geographic information for snake classification. However, the issue of imbalanced datasets remained unresolved. I Bolon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,115.28,599.05,18.07,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> used Vision Transformer as the backbone and integrated geographic information through binary masking.</p><p>In summary, these network structures and methods provide insights for improving image recognition and snake species classification. However, each method has its strengths and limitations. Some methods excel in snake species classification accuracy but are limited by imbalanced data, while others can incorporate rich meta-information but may require more computational resources. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these pros and cons and choose the appropriate method based on specific requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dataset</head><p>Through analyzing the sample distribution of different categories in the dataset, we discovered a significant class imbalance issue in the dataset. Some classes have as many as 2000 samples, while others have only a few samples. The distribution of images for each category is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,119.95,220.76,3.68,10.91" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, which exhibits a long-tail distribution pattern. Furthermore, we compared the dataset with the dataset from the previous year and found an increase of over 200 snake species in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,116.92,247.86,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. However, the training set has fewer samples this year, with a reduction of 100000 samples. The increased number of classes and the decreased training samples further increase the difficulty of this year's task. Evaluation Metric:This year, the organizers calculated various metrics. First, they calculated the standard Acc and macro-averaged 𝐹 1. In addition, they calculated the toxicant confusion error, which is the number of samples that confused toxicants as harmless divided by the number of toxicants in the test set.</p><p>First consider a function 𝑝 such 𝑝(𝑠) = 1 if species 𝑠 is venonmous, otherwise 𝑝(𝑠) = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model</head><p>For the competition, we utilized the MetaFormer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,315.46,626.38,17.76,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> architecture, which is a useful network architecture for computer vision tasks. MetaFormer has designed a five-stage network structure. The first stage S0 is a simple three-layer convolutional structure. S1 and S2 are MBConv blocks <ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.29,667.03,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> with squeeze-excitation. MBConv blocks are based on an inverted residual mechanism and a bottleneck design. The inverted residual structure is designed to provide higher nonlinear representation capability while keeping the model lightweight, and the bottleneck uses smaller intermediate layers to reduce computation. S3 and S4 are Transformer blocks with relative position bias. This bias alleviates the problem that the order of the tokens in the input sequence cannot be used in the self-attention operation.</p><p>We modify the input meta information of MetaFormer. Specifically, the meta information is modified to include the code, endemic, and binomial names. The workflow of MetaFormer is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,164.29,181.81,4.23,10.91" target="#fig_3">4</ref> <ref type="bibr" coords="6,168.52,181.81,16.92,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Long-Tailed loss</head><p>In order to address the issue of imbalanced sample distribution in the dataset, we employed a long-tail loss function. There are several commonly used loss functions to cope with the class imbalance problem. ArcFace loss <ref type="bibr" coords="6,233.76,490.58,17.76,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is designed for face recognition tasks. Other loss functions include the Class-Balanced Loss <ref type="bibr" coords="6,235.69,504.13,16.34,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which calculates a small neighborhood associated with each sample for computation. Seesaw Loss <ref type="bibr" coords="6,278.83,517.68,17.78,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> mitigates the risk of increased misclassification due to gradient attenuation in negative samples. Equalization Loss v2 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,407.41,531.23,18.07,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> discovers a novel gradient-guided reweighting mechanism.</p><p>Compared with other loss functions, ArcFace Loss optimizes the measure of feature space by introducing angle cosine values, so that the angles between feature vectors can reflect the similarity between samples. By normalizing the feature vectors and introducing an adjustable parameter, ArcFace Loss enhances the distinguishability of the features and reduces the difference in magnitude of the feature vectors. These features make ArcFace Loss a good performer in fine-grained classification tasks, so we adopt it as our loss function. ArcFace loss's formula is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="7,159.26,108.32,347.38,35.56">𝐿 arcface (𝜃) = - 1 𝑁 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 log 𝑒 𝑠(cos(𝜃𝑦 𝑖 +𝑚)) 𝑒 𝑠(cos(𝜃𝑦 𝑖 +𝑚)) + ∑︀ 𝑛 𝑗=1,𝑗̸ =𝑦 𝑖 𝑒 𝑠 cos 𝜃 𝑗 (4)</formula><p>where 𝑁 represents the number of samples, 𝑛 represents the number of classes, 𝑦 𝑖 is the true class of the 𝑖-th sample, 𝜃 𝑦 𝑖 is the angle between the feature vector of the 𝑖-th sample and its true class, and 𝜃 𝑗 is the angle between the feature vector of the 𝑖-th sample and the 𝑗-th class. 𝑠 represents the scale parameter. 𝑚 represents the margin parameter, which is the inter-class distance. In both the numerator and denominator, a margin is added to each individual term, represented by 𝛼 and 𝛽 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,232.05,222.23,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. By calculating the loss with this margin, the margin increases gradually, resulting in the compression of the region for each class. This effectively enlarges the inter-class distance while reducing the intra-class distance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">SimCLR self-supervised learning</head><p>SimCLR <ref type="bibr" coords="7,138.65,603.26,17.80,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is a self-supervised learning framework that has gained significant attention in the field of computer vision. The main goal of SimCLR is to learn meaningful representations of unlabeled data by maximizing agreement between different augmented views of the same image while minimizing agreement between views of different images. The framework's workflow is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,163.19,657.46,3.67,10.91" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. By maximizing the similarity between the representations of positive image pairs, SimCLR encourages the model to learn meaningful and discriminative features of images.</p><p>We also adopted the InfoNCE <ref type="bibr" coords="8,235.17,338.25,17.96,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> loss function, commonly used in contrastive learning. It places positive samples in the numerator and negative samples in the denominator, aiming to maximize the similarity of positive samples while minimizing the similarity of negative samples. The formula for InfoNCE is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="8,225.99,402.34,280.65,28.96">𝐿 𝑞 = -log exp (𝑞 • 𝑘 + /𝜏 ) ∑︀ 𝑘 𝑖=0 exp (𝑞 • 𝑘 𝑖 /𝜏 )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑘 + represents the positive samples for 𝑞 while the remaining 𝑘 denotes the negative samples. 𝜏 refers to the temperature hyperparameter, which we set to 0.25 in our subsequent experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Pre-post-process</head><p>Data Preprocessing: In order to enhance the generalization ability of the method, we applied image augmentation techniques to the input images, including resizing and center cropping. We also introduced random vertical flipping, random horizontal flipping, and random 45-degree rotation to augment the training dataset.</p><p>Data Postprocessing: During the testing phase, we employed the Test Time Augmentation (TTA) strategy. TTA augments the input test data with operations such as expansion, flipping, and rotation to obtain a set of data for an image and take the mean value of the final predictions. For the csv file of the test dataset, each observation-id corresponds to multiple images, and the model predicts one class for each image, so there may be multiple different predicted classes for each observation id. For each observation id, we select the class with the most occurrences as the final prediction result. We also adopt an integrated learning strategy to improve the accuracy by fusing the results of MetaFormer-0, Metaformer-2, and Metaformer-2 with SimCLR three models. For each observation-id, we select the class with the most occurrences from the csv files generated by the three models as the final prediction result.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Implementation Details</head><p>We conducted all the experiments with one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. We used the AdamW <ref type="bibr" coords="9,119.89,193.06,24.78,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> optimizer with a weight decay of 0.05 and a base learning rate of 5e-5. The batch size is determined by the maximum number that the GPU can handle, usually an integer multiple of 2. We use the batch size of 22. And the initial learning rate is modified according to batch size (That is, the learning rate multiplied by the batch size multiplied by the number of GPUs divided by 512.). Also, set the number of training epochs to 100. During training, we used data augmentation and rotation. We also use the CosineLRScheduler of the timm library to modify the learning rate. At first the learning rate increases from the warmup learning rate 5e-8 to the base learning rate, and then enters the cosine annealing phase, where the learning rate is adjusted by the cosine function, decreasing with increasing epochs until it decreases to min learning rate 5e-7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Ablation Studies</head><p>Firstly, we attempted the approach based on EfficientNet <ref type="bibr" coords="9,361.89,364.14,16.41,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, the loss function used was CrossEntropy Loss. However, we found the model couldn't incorporate meta information, resulting in lower accuracy than expected. Therefore, we switched to the MetaFormer model. Comparison of above two models is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="9,317.22,404.79,3.66,10.91">2</ref>. The results demonstrated the superiority of the MetaFormer backbone.

Due to time and resource constraints, we were unable to further explore the long-tail loss function and new contrastive learning methods. However, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential for further improvements. Future work could involve the following aspects: 1) Exploring or designing new long-tail loss functions. 2) Investigating other contrastive learning methods, such as the MAE <ref type="bibr" coords="10,89.29,320.96,17.91,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref> pre-training method, to further enhance the performance of pre-training.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,229.66,416.69,9.96;2,89.29,241.61,413.53,9.96"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: General image classification vs FGVC.
