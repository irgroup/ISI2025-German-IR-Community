<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Documentation burnout contributes to clinician job dissatisfaction, and clinical notes often omit salient information. The automatic generation of notes from doctor-patient conversations using a computerized medical scribe, referred to as a Digital Scribe, provides an alternative, potentially time-saving documentation process. Generating notes from the transcribed patient interviews requires reorganizing utterances by topical note sections, identifying the clinically significant information, and generating a medical language summary. The MEDIQA-Sum task of ImageCLEF 2023 explores the development of Digital Scribe through the generation of clinical note summaries of transcribed patient visits. We participated in all three Subtasks and made contributions related to note subsection classification and dialogue-note alignment. We achieved high classification accuracy (81.5%) for Subtask A by fine-tuning T5-large, which ranked 2ND among 10 participants. We explored the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models in the Subtask B summarization task. For Subtask C, we manually annotated the alignment between dialogue transcripts and clinical notes for a subset of training examples, to assist in learning the mapping from dialogue content to clinical note subsection.</p></div>

Summarization datasets that are frequently used in general summarization tasks include CNN/DailyMail <ref type="bibr" coords="2,365.90,443.67,20.40,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, XSum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.68,443.67,21.31,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, SamSum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,479.96,443.67,21.78,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, DialogSum <ref type="bibr" coords="2,136.49,457.22,20.98,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> etc. Unlike the general domain summarization task, where the full dialogues are relatively short and can be modeled directly to generate the full summaries <ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.15,470.77,16.40,10.91" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.28,470.77,12.53,10.91" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,475.53,470.77,12.53,10.91" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.79,470.77,12.30,10.91" target="#b21">22]</ref>, clinical dialogues are frequently lengthy and beyond the input limit of most models.</p><p>The summarization of doctor-patient conversations using Digital Scribes is a relatively new area of research. Prior Digital Scribe work has explored various approaches to generate clinical notes from doctor-patient encounter dialogues, which can be relatively long. Most studies apply transformer-based models -Enarvi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,307.14,538.52,18.06,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> compared hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder with transformer-based model in a sequence-to-sequence approach. They found that transformer-based model was faster to train and outperformed RNN. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,102.44,579.17,17.76,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> leveraged pre-trained a BART model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,284.17,579.17,17.76,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and fine-tuned it with limited clinical dialogue data. Michalopoulos et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.81,592.72,17.84,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> applied a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and integrated medical domain knowledge. Joshi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.82,606.27,18.07,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> proposed a variant of a pointer generator network <ref type="bibr" coords="2,175.83,619.81,16.30,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which incorporated local structures in patients' medical history. The model captured important properties of medical conversations, such as medical knowledge coming from standardized medical ontology. Our method aligned closely with Yim and Yetisgen <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,660.46,16.09,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which broke down whole-note summarization into two stages: dialogue-to-note alignment and dialogue snippet summarization. They did not utilize pre-trained transformer models to enhance generalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Subtasks &amp; Data</head><p>In this section, we describe the three MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Subtasks and present an exploratory analysis on the provided datasets. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,275.23,172.69,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref> summarizes the task type and system inputs and outputs for each Subtask. The input for all Subtasks is transcribed doctor-patient dialogue, where the speaker roles (doctor vs. patient) are indicated at the beginning of each dialogue turn. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,115.17,213.34,4.97,10.91">1</ref> presents an example dialogue snippet with the associated subsection header and clinical note summary.</p><p>In this paper, we distinguish between sections and subsections: sections are the four main sections (i.e., "Subjective", "Objective Exam", "Objective Results" and "Assessment and Plan") that are evaluated by the MEDIQA-Sum organizers. Subsections refer to topical subheadings in the clinical notes (e.g. "Exam", "Chief Complaint", "History of Present Illness", etc.), which were identified using pattern matching. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Subtask A -Dialogue2Topic Classification</head><p>Clinical notes are typically semi-structured and organized by topical subsections. Subtask A is a classification task, where the input is a snippet from a doctor-patient dialogue (dialogue snippet) and the output is a subsection header. A set of 20 subsection headers (e.g. Assessment, Medications, etc.) was predefined by the challenge, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,401.66,500.82,5.07,10.91">6</ref> in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Subtask B -Dialogue2Note Summarization</head><p>Subtask B is a summarization task, where the input is a dialogue snippet, similar to Subtask A, and the output is a summary of the snippet, corresponding to the prose of a subsection of a clinical note.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Subtask C -Full-Encounter Dialogue2Note Summarization</head><p>Unlike Subtask B which focus on single subsection summarization, Subtask C requires summarizing a full doctor-patient encounter dialogue through complete clinical note with multiple subsections. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,172.72,654.47,5.05,10.91" target="#tab_4">7</ref> in the Appendix shows the distribution of the subsection headers for Subtask C training and validation sets. There is a mismatch between subsection headers of subtask</p><p>A &amp; B and those of subtask C. For example, the subsection header "GYNHX" (which stands for "Gynecological History") is a label for Subtask A, but is not used in SubTask C. Similarly, the subsection header "VITALS" is exclusive to Subtask C. Additionally, there is inconsistency in the phrasing of subsection header names. For instance, Subtask A uses a subsection header "EXAM", and Subtask C uses "EXAM", "PHYSICAL EXAM", and "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION. " To address this problem, we map the original 20 subsection headers in Subtask A and 26 subsection headers in Subtask C to 12 canonical headers, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,352.30,168.26,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_5">8</ref> in the Appendix. To create this mapping, we merge the original subsection headers that have similar contents in the clinical notes. For example, in Subtask A and B, subsections "DIAGNOSIS", "LABS" and "IMAGING" all describe the results of some medical tests or labs; therefore, we merge them into the 'RESULTS' subsection. We also used the section tagger code provided by the task organizers, where subsections such as "PLAN", "ASSESSMENT" and "DISPOSITION" are merged into "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN". We use the canonical subsection headers in Subtask C.</p></div>

We did not fine-tune GPT-3.5 because it is a proprietary model that cannot be fine-tuned. We were unable to fine-tune Alpaca-LoRA within the time constraints of the shared task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Subtask C -Full-Encounter Dialogue2Note Summarization</head><p>Subtask C summarizes full encounter dialogues into comprehensive clinical notes with topical subsection headers such as "Chief Complaint" and "Review of Systems". We approach it in three steps. First, we split the full dialogue into dialogue exchanges ( §4.3.1). Second, we build two classifiers which label each dialogue exchange with one or more subsection headers ( §4.3.2). Third, dialogue exchanges with the same subsection header are aggregated (concatenated) and the concatenated string is sent to Subtask B summarizer models to generate the associated note for that subsection. <ref type="foot" coords="5,201.05,270.27,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We repeat this process for every Subtask C canonical subsection header, grouping the generated note text (with their subsection headers) by note section and concatenating all section text to form the full clinical note.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Splitting the Full Dialogue into Dialogue Exchanges</head><p>Since the full dialogue transcripts are often too long to be used as a single input sequence with many language models (see mean and standard deviation statistics in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,430.27,361.84,3.62,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref>), for Subtask C, we operated on shorter dialogue exchanges. The full dialogue was split at the start of each doctor turn using the speaker role tags (e.g., "Doctor: " and "[Doctor]"), such that each exchange consists of a single doctor turn and zero or more patient turns. Qualitatively, an exchange frequently constitutes a relatively independent question-answer (QA) pair, where the doctor asks a question and the patient responds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Classifying Dialogue Exchanges</head><p>After the full dialogue is split into dialogue exchanges, each exchange is labeled with one or more Subtask C canonical subsection headers. Like Subtask A, we formulate this subsection labeling task as a text generation problem using T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.82,505.85,17.88,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and fine-tuned T5-large with training data. Our input template for Subtask C is slightly different from the one for Subtask A, consisting of the exchange to be labeled, two exchanges preceding and two following the current exchange, a question about the topic, and a list of subsection headers (see Appendix A.5). The neighboring exchanges are included in the input because they would provide contextual information to help classify the current exchange. The main challenge for fine-tuning T5 is that no labeled data exist for this classification task. We resolve this issue in two ways, resulting in two classifiers, Classifier-I and Classifier-II. Classifier-I is a single-label classifier trained with Subtask A training data. Since the input in Subtask A is a dialogue snippet not a dialogue exchange, we split each snippet into exchanges as described in §4.3.1 and labeled each exchange with the subsection header of the snippet. To make the exchange sequences similar to the Subtask C data, we sample the Subtask A snippets following the common order of the subsections in the Subtask C training data. There are several problems with these synthesized data. First, a snippet belonging to a subsection does not necessarily mean that every exchange in the snippet belongs to the same subsection. Second, the synthesized data use Subtask A subsection headers, and there is a mismatch between those headers and the ones in Subtask C, as discussed in §3.3. Third, a dialogue exchange might align to zero or more subsections, whereas in the synthesized data, each exchange is assigned with exactly one subsection. To address these limitations and better understand the dialoguenote alignment, we manually annotated the alignment for 14 files randomly selected from the Subtask C training set. The detail of the annotation is in Appendix A. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,407.66,222.46,4.45,10.91" target="#b5">6</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,89.04,236.01,10.34,10.91" target="#tab_0">12</ref> in the Appendix, only 37.5-41.2% of exchanges align to exactly one subsection, 36.0-37.8% of exchanges do not align to any subsection, and the remaining 22.0-24.7% align to multiple subsections. Classifier-II is a multi-label classifier, trained with the 14 manual alignment files. It uses Subtask C canonical subsection headers as labels and can assign multiple labels to an exchange. To fine-tune T5-large, we remove the exchanges that are not aligned to any subsections. During test time, we applied both classifiers to the dialogue exchanges and took the union of the predictions as the classification result.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Subtask A -Dialogue2Topic Classification</head><p>We plot the confusion matrix on Subtask A validation set in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,380.01,546.49,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_3">1</ref> of the Appendix, where the accuracy among 100 examples is 74%. We observe the model is unable to detect some minority classes in the Subtask A training set, such as "LABS", "EDCOURSE" and "IMAGING", possibly as a result of class imbalance present in the training set. "GENERAL HISTORY" examples can be misclassified as other specific types of history or chief complaints ("CC"), which may be due to the fact that "GENERAL HISTORY" overlaps significantly with "CC" with respect to similarity in contents. Additionally, given the generative setting, our model hallucinates and generates labels that are not in the training set in rare occasion (i.e. "EVALUATION_REPORT").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Subtask B -Dialogue2Note Summarization</head><p>We manually checked some summaries on the validation set and noticed a few issues -1) In several (3%) cases, our summarizer generates "None, " while the gold standards are not. However, the semantics of gold standards are similar to "None". For example, essentially unchanged from last visit or has not had previous history. Therefore, word-based evaluation metrics such as ROUGE will be low in such cases. 2) We are using the same summarizer for different subsections that have different styles (e.g., "CC" is usually short, while "History of Present Illness" is generally longer). For future work, we plan to incorporate the subsection header to make the model aware of such differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Subtask C -Full-Encounter Dialogue2Note Summarization</head><p>For subtask C, we trained two classifiers to predict the subsection for a given exchange. Based on qualitative analysis conducted on the validation set by matching the dialogue to the system output, we observed multiple sources of error: The generated "CC" subsections are usually correlated to the main concern being addressed in the current visit but are not succinct enough compared to the gold standard. Subsections such as "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN" usually summarizes previous subsections and synthesizes information from the dialogue in parts pertinent to the specific instructions given by the doctor, which suggests that using the same summarizer for all subsections may fail to distinguish between subsections of different styles. The "VITALS" and "RESULTS" subsections do not appear in the training data in Subtask A &amp; B. Therefore, our summarizer trained on Subtask A &amp; B data may not be able to assign such subsections. In future work, we could have a separate component that extracts vital sign information from the dialogue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we presented our approaches for the three Subtasks in 2023 MEDIQA-Sum challenge.</p><p>For Subtask A, we achieved a high classification accuracy (81.5%) with a fine-tuned T5-large model, which ranked 2ND among 10 participants. For Subtask B, we assessed the capabilities of several state-of-the-art language models in the summarization task. Our final system yielded moderate performances with a fine-tuned T5-Large model. We identified several next steps for improving performance. Incorporating the subsection label could potentially improve the results, given that different subsections have various summary styles. GPT-3.5 has the best validation performance among the all pre-trained language models we evaluated, indicating its great potential in the summarization task. We anticipate that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 could boost the performance, if possible. For Subtask C, we built two dialogue exchange classifiers with 14 manually aligned files and Subtask A training data and use them and the Subtask B summarizers to generate comprehensive full-note summaries. We hypothesize that better subsection classification can lead to better full-note summaries. As a future direction, we believe that annotating more files could further improve performance.</p></div>

System message defines the overall task instructions for GPT-3.5. User message provides an example dialogue, and Assistant message provides the gold summary for the corresponding dialogue.

[ONTOLOGY]". Classifier I uses the 20 subsection headers for subtask A (see the 1st column in Table <ref type="table" coords="16,496.73,561.19,3.65,10.91" target="#tab_5">8</ref>). If a header is an acronym (e.g., CC), its full name is used as the class label; that is, the For preprocessing, we split the dialogues into exchanges as explained in §4.3.1, and split the clinical notes into sentences by using the spaCy sentence segmentizer <ref type="foot" coords="17,409.72,229.78,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Then we manually align each sentence in the clinical note with the dialogue exchanges that are deemed associated with the current sentence. It turns out that the mapping between exchanges and sentences is many-to-many.

It can be seen that approximately a third of exchanges are not aligned to any sentences and thus have no subsection labels; these can be things such as greetings which appear in the dialogues but not in the clinical notes.

The other two rows are defined similarly.

Compared with the experiment using human annotations, the automatic alignment approach outperforms the one using human annotation with respect to only ROUGE-2.
