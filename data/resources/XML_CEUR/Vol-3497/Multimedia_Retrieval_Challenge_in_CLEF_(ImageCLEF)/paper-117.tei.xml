<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Clinical note summarization is a challenging task that aims to extract the most relevant information from unstructured text documents and present it concisely and coherently. Large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5, have limitations in terms of trustworthiness and cost-effectiveness for generating complete clinical notes from patient-doctor dialogues. In this paper, we propose a novel template-based approach of for clinical note summarization from dialogue. Our model is under the control of a specific template, which is constructed by our own team and relies on expert validation. The semantic-based partition module fills in the template with key facts extracted from the dialogue using a combination of rule-based and neural methods. The template-based summarization module fine-tunes state-of-the-art (SOTA) BART models and other strategies to generate fluent and informative summaries corresponding to parts in the template. We evaluated our approach on released datasets of MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Shared Tasks, which contain clinical notes from dialogue for various problems. Our approach achieves the best ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores for full note summarization, outperforming several strong baselines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Clinical summarization involves gathering, organizing, and presenting patient data to support clinical tasks. It can save time, improve clinical accuracy, and mitigate errors by assisting clinicians in collecting, distilling, and interpreting patient information. However, the challenge lies in dealing with the fragmentation and diversity of medical information from various sources and systems. To address this challenge, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to automatically generate clinical summaries from electronic health records. Text summarization, which can be extractive or abstractive, is a key component of NLP for generating concise summaries <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.00,114.06,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In the context of clinical summarization, NLP can be applied to generate summaries of clinical encounters based on prior notes in EHRs <ref type="bibr" coords="2,312.75,141.16,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These summaries provide an overview of a patient's condition, diagnosis, treatment plan, and other relevant information for current or future care providers. Extractive methods select the most relevant sentences or phrases from prior notes, while abstractive methods generate new sentences or phrases that restate or paraphrase the original information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.20,195.36,11.30,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Leveraging NLP techniques for clinical summarization has the potential to streamline the process and enhance the accessibility of critical patient information for healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.18,222.46,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as addressed by Mallen et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,276.17,236.01,11.41,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Large Language Models, though achieved SOTA results on multiple NLP tasks, are not completely trustworthy and efficient at all. They are uncontrollable and technically hardly able to be deployed offline. Instead, multi-component frameworks, which mostly follow a hybrid approach, are a more reasonable approach. In this work, we introduce a novel template-based approach designed to efficiently handle the problem of clinical note summarization. Our models have achieved promising results in the MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Shared Tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.16,317.30,11.43,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Overview of proposed model</head><p>The overall architecture of the proposed model is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,403.23,475.94,3.76,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Our proposed model contains four modules:</p><p>1. Pre-processing: This module does cleaning noises from the raw input dialogues, and outputs the cleaned ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Semantic-based partition:</head><p>The cleaned dialogue is broken into smaller units and those which are supportive for a certain query set are gathered into a text. This text (namely extractive text) is significantly shorter than the whole dialogue and conveys only relevant information to queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Template-based summarization:</head><p>We apply a specific strategy for individual part of a form. Each method receives corresponding extractive text and metadata (prompt, question) as input, then outputs a summary. The template decides how these summaries should be combined. 4. Post-processing: Finally, we design a module to fine-grain the output, which can output the format of a standard clinical note. By analyzing statistics from training and validation datasets and incorporating insights from medical professionals, we have developed a general clinical note template.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Template preparation</head><p>The template consists of four divisions, namely Subjective, Objective exam, Objective results, Assessment and plan. Each of these divisions include sections and their subpoints in clinical notes. We analyzed the number of occurences of each section and point in the training set and validation set, part of which is shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,304.24,365.24,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. We eliminated points with low occurence frequency from the template. The template provides the following information for each point.</p><p>• Semantic-based partition information. We include queries, keywords, similarity score threshold and other partition configurations for each point. • Summarization information. We include summarization strategy, output length threshold and model options. We include prefix and postfix templates that were derived by examining the format of clinical notes. Furthermore, we provide different postprocessing templates for each points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Pre-processing</head><p>The input dialogue contains several errors from a standard speech-to-text process. We aim to address three following problems from the raw input:</p><p>• Spoken Noise: Different from written language input, dialogue contains more meaningless words and noises such as hesitation words ("um", "hmm", "uh") and repeated words. These noises limit the capability of the large language model trained on cleaner data. We defined a set of replacements for such words and replace them in the raw dialogue. • Missing Punctuation: 32 over 87 samples in the train and validation datasets do not contain punctuation. Punctuation plays an important role in downstream problems: chunking sentences, identifying semantic structures, understanding semantic representation (in Transformer-based models), etc. Following the work of Guhr et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,443.08,652.40,16.21,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we adopt a BERT model to restore the punctuation of the spoken-cleaned dialogues.</p><p>• Wrong-Role Dialogue: 4 over 87 dialogues in the train and validation datasets contain wrong-role utterances. This error leads to serious problems in the semantic capturing capability of the summarization models. To overcome this problem, we defined rules to detect the true role of speak in each utterance in the punctuation-restored dialogues and then align wrong-role dialogues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Semantic-based partition</head><p>For each point (or section if it does not have any subpoint) in the template, we shrink the context volume to the meaningful threshold. A query set is pre-defined for each point in the template limiting the scope of meaningful information. The overall flow follows: firstly, dialogue is divided into smaller units (utterances and sentences); these units are then encoded into vectorbased representations; and lastly, calculate the similarity score to drop the non-relevant units (lower than a certain threshold).</p><p>Utterance and Query Encoding Sentence-BERT (SBERT) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,358.31,287.40,17.75,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a robust framework of trustworthy sentence-level and paragraph-level embedding based on BERT models. In our work, we adopt a State-Of-The-Art SBERT model trained on millions of English query-answer pairs and normal similar sentence pairs. This model embeds given queries and sentences in the dialogue into vectors of 384 dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Similarity Calculation</head><p>Having embedding vectors set Q for queries and U for sentences in utterance, we calculate a matching score 𝑠𝑐 (U, Q) for each utterance by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,217.11,406.76,161.06,25.42">𝑠𝑐 (U, Q) = max (𝑞,𝑢)∈Q×U (︂ u • q ‖u‖ ‖q‖ )︂</formula><p>where 𝑢, 𝑞 ∈ R 384 are corresponding SBERT embedding vectors for each query in the predefined query set and meaningful sentences in an utterance, respectively. The returned value of 𝑠𝑐 (U, Q) is a scalar score, which determines the "support" of the current utterance to the given query set. We drop the non-relative utterances based on a certain threshold.</p><p>Alternatively, during analyzing the template, we find out some "signature words" in the dialogue that takes a strong effect on the appearance of valuable information. To improve the coverage, we implemented a strict matching method over sentence level. Given a query set, the output of this strict matching method is a text whose sentences contain any keyword in the set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Template-based summarization</head><p>We propose three different strategies for this summarization method: General summarization, Summarization with prompt, and Form filling. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,244.12,633.21,12.69,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a combined scenario of two advanced architecture in Language Understanding task (BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,292.29,646.76,17.10,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) and Language Generation task (GPT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,483.85,646.76,15.88,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). We adopt large pre-finetuned BART models on several summarization datasets: SAMSUM <ref type="bibr" coords="5,487.01,660.31,16.14,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, CNN/DM <ref type="bibr" coords="6,133.69,86.97,16.09,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and XSum <ref type="bibr" coords="6,204.17,86.97,17.76,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> dataset. During model inference, we combined these BART models with BEAM search <ref type="bibr" coords="6,188.45,100.52,17.76,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to generate the final sequence and used corresponding tokenizers to revert back to textual format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General summarization BART</head><p>Summarization with prompt GPT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,268.38,142.82,18.06,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> showed promising performance on various text generation problems by controlling generation direction via a beginning prompt. Inspired by this idea, we also proposed the same scenario of controlling the BART decoder generation direction via a prompt, which is separated from the input.The other components are shared with the general summarization method.</p><p>Form filling Besides the need for abstractive summarization, certain points (or sections) require highly accurate information from the speakers. For such section, we define two other methods which rely almost on extractive approaches:</p><p>• Answer Extracting: We employ a DistilBERT model <ref type="bibr" coords="6,351.54,275.39,17.76,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> trained on SQuAD dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="6,488.23,275.39,17.76,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for this task. The model receives input of a predefined question tailed with the context (the output from the semantic-partition module) and returns text spans indicating the answer for a given question in the context. • Shallow Abstractive: We convert the output from the semantic-partition module into a more valued form following methods: cleaning non-written words, removing out-of-scope sentences via a similarity matrix and a relevance threshold, and aligning pronouns. These methods aim at a lossless information representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note completion</head><p>Having corresponding summaries for each point (or section), we format them in the order of the prepared form. The output is a raw clinical note.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Post-processing</head><p>To improve the generated output and mimic the writing style of real clinical notes, several adjustments are made. First, health indexes are modified by adding metric units and rewriting them in abbreviation form. Disease names are standardized using terminologies commonly seen in clinical notes. Verbal numbers are converted into numerical notation. The pronoun "you" is replaced with "the patient" in relevant sentences. Lastly, certain non-medical questions are removed from the output.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset and metrics</head><p>We used a dataset from Subtask C named Full-Encounter Dialogue2Note Summarization in MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Shared Tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="6,246.26,624.52,11.58,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The dataset includes 67 samples, 20 samples and 40 samples in the training set, validation set and test set respectively. Each sample contains a full encounter conversation and a clinical note (except for the test set) which summarises the related conversations. The encounter conversations are expressed in text, including the clinical roles and contents. The clinical notes are structured as a template comprising four divisions, namely Subjective, Objective Exam, Objective Results, and Assessment and Plan.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Implementation</head><p>We implement the proposed modelon Python 3.8.5 environment, torch 1.13.1 and transformers 4.26.0. We conduct our runs on a local machine of 8x Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti (11Gb CUDA each). In terms of mentioned pre-trained models, we adopt models under the public-sharing policy of Huggingface Model Hub, which are:</p><p>• SBERT model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for utterance and query encoding. • DistilBERT model distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad for answer extracting. • BART models philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum, lidiya/bart-large-xsum -samsum, and amagzari/bart-large-xsum-finetuned-samsum-v2 for summarization tasks (both general summarization and summarization with prompt)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Results</head><p>This section presents three different settings of our runs, namely three different versions of our template. We define a baseline template which conveys standard parts of a clinical note and relies majorly on the effectiveness of abstractive summarization models (BARTs). In the second version, we add more extractive parts in our template to handle the irrelevant information while texts are abstracted in neural models. Finally, we introduce the final fine-tuned version, which majorly inherits ideas of the two previous versions while having more complete prompts, queries, and questions. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,128.21,509.73,5.17,10.91">2</ref> presents a summary of the performance results for our models and comparative models in Task C full note on the test dataset. Our template-based approaches achieves the highest scores on ROUGE-2 metric of 0.2331, ROUGE-L metric of 0.2481, and ROUGE-L-sum metric of 0.4653. In comparison with the leading team on ROUGE-1 metric, our fine-tuning settings are slightly under 0.0022 while remaining outstandingly higher on all other metrics. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,128.35,577.47,5.17,10.91">3</ref> summarizes the performance results of our models and the comparative models for each division of Task C on the test dataset in ROUGE-1 metric. Our approaches achieve the highest values in "Objective exam" and "Assessment and plan" divisions, while showing a promising result on average. Noticeably, "Assessment and plan" is the division that relies on only shallow abstractive methods in all our settings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel template-based approach designed to efficiently handle the problem of clinical note summary from dialogue. Our approach relies on a multi-component framework: a pre-processing module, a semantic-based partition module, and a templates-based summarizing module. We evaluated our approach on released datasets of MEDIQA-Sum 2023 Shared Tasks, which contain clinical notes from dialogue for various problems. We propose a baseline template which conveys standard parts of a clinical note and relies majorly on the effectiveness of abstractive summarization models for pretraining seq2seq models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,393.06,418.20,8.93"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of proposed model for Clinical Note Generation from Doctor-Patient Conversation.</figDesc></figure>
