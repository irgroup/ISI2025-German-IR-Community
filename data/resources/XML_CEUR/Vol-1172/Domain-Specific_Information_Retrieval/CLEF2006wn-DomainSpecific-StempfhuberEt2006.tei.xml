<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The CLEF domain-specific track uses databases in different languages from the social science domain as the basis for retrieval of documents relevant to a user's query. Predefined topics simulate the user's information needs and are used by the research groups participating in this track to generate actual queries. The documents are structured into individual elements so that they can be used for optimizing the search strategies. One type of the retrieval task was on crosslanguage retrieval, the finding of information using queries in a different language than the actual language of the documents. English, German and Russian were used as languages for queries and documents. Queries therefore had to be translated from one of the languages to one or more of the other languages. Besides the cross-language tasks also monolingual retrieval tasks were carried out were query and document are in the same language. The focus here was to map the query onto the language and internal structure of the documents. This paper gives an overview of the domain-specific track and reports on noteworthy trends in approaches and results as well as on the topic creation and assessment process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The CLEF domain-specific task is focused on cross-language retrieval in English, German and Russian. Queries as well as documents are taken from the social science domain and are provided in all three languages. This section presents the domain-specific task with the focus on the corpora used. It gives an overview on the 2006 track. The following sections are on the methods used and results achieved in the retrieval and on the processes of topic-creation and assessment. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future development of the domain-specific track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>The CLEF Domain-specific track</p><p>The domain-specific track can divided into 3 subtasks depending on the language of the query and the documents.</p><p>• In the monolingual subtask queries and documents are in the same language, the Russian subtask uses the INION Collection while the English und German subtask work on the GIRT corpus • In the bilingual subtasks queries in one language are used with a collection in a different language.</p><p>The domain-specific track includes 6 bilingual subtasks for all combinations of English, German, and Russian. • The multilingual task uses queries in one language against the combination of the content of all collection.</p><p>Queries in the CLEF are provided as topics. Each topic is the representation of an information need form the social science domain. Topics as well as documents are structured with the topic including a title, a short description of the information need and a longer narrative for further clarification. The documents, among other information, include fields such as author, title and year of publication, terms from a thesaurus and an abstract:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Title</head><p>Childlessness in Germany Description Find information on the factors for childlessness in Germany.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Narrative</head><p>All documents examining causes and consequences of childlessness among couples in Germany are of interest. This also includes documents covering the topic's macroeconomic aspects.</p><p>The participating groups submits one or more runs for each subtask. A run includes the 1000 highest ranked document for each of the 25 topics. The runs from all groups for a given subtask are pooled, the highest ranking document are then assessed by domain experts in order to obtain a reference on the relevance of the documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The GIRT4 and INION Collections</head><p>GIRT, the German Indexing and Retrieval Testdatabase is a pseudo-parallel corpus with 302.638 documents in English and German. The documents cover primarily the domain of the German Social Sciences, in particular scientific publications. Details about the Girt corpus, especially about the development of the current fourth version, can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.13,301.80,10.81,9.02" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,190.95,301.80,7.21,9.02" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The INION corpus covers the Russian social sciences and economics. The collection includes 145.802 documents and replaces the Russian Social Science Corpus used in 2005. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Participants and submitted Runs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Methods and Results Overview</head><p>Details on the results and employed methods of all groups are given in the corresponding chapters of this volume. This chapter gives only a brief overview of the methods employed. The University of Hagen used a reranking approach based on antagonistic terms, improving the mean average precision. The Chemnitz Technical University used Apache Lucene as the basis for the retrieval and achieved the best results with a combination of suffix stripping, stemming, and decompounding. The University of California, Berkeley, did not use methods for thesaurus-based query expansion and de-compounding as they were employed before. The University of Neuchatel used DFR GL2 and Okapi with several combinations of the fields included in a topic against the different fields of GIRT4 documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Topics</head><p>The team responsible for the topic-creation process changed in 2006. This has lead to changes in the topiccreation process itself as well. In order to produce a large number of potential information needs covering a wide area of the social sciences, a number of domain experts familiar with the GIRT corpus were asked for contributions to the topics. 25 topics were selected from 42 submissions. These topics were compared to the topics from the years 2001-2005 in order to remove topics too similar to topics already used. Removed topics were replaced from the pool of previously unused topics. The definition of topics by domain experts with knowledge about the corpus resulted in many topics of interest but also caused more effort in the selection of the actual topic-set. This was due to the fact that not all submitters of topics had detailed knowledge of the CLEF topic-creation rules and corrections had to be made afterwards to provide consistent structure and wording. For future CLEF-campaigns, this process will be further optimized.</p><p>The definition of topics suitable for the GIRT corpus as well as the Russian INION corpus remains challenging. Lack of Russian language skills in the topic-creation team increases the difficulty of creating a set of topics well suited for both corpora. An additional factor in 2006 was lack of experience with the INION corpus. Also in this regard, we hop to improve the topic cretation process in the next campaign as the multilingual corpus is now stable again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Assessment Process</head><p>As in 2005 the assessment for English and German were done using a Java Swing program while our partner from the Research Computing Center of the M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University used the CLEF assessment tool for the assessment of the Russian documents. The decision to use this software for English and German was made based on the fact that the assessments of English and German documents from the pseudoparallel corpus should be compared to each other. An interesting finding was the statement of both assessors that they liked the ability to choose between keyboard-shortcuts and a mouse driven interface since it allowed for different working styles in the otherwise monotonous assessment task. Figures <ref type="figure" coords="3,397.53,320.53,9.47,9.02">1a</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="3,428.38,320.53,9.98,9.02" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> show the number of documents in the pool for each topic and the percentage of relevant documents. It should be noted that, while the number of documents found for each topic is relatively stable, the percentage of relevant documents shows outliers with the topics number 167 and 169. Investigation on this outliers and discussion with the assessors showed that the outliers were caused by complex exclusion criteria in case of topic 167 and the use of the complex concepts of gender specific education and the specifics of the German primary education system in case of topic 169. The reassessment of "pair" documents present in the English and the German pools of the parallel corpusfirst introduced in the 2005 campaign -was repeated in 2006. When the two document of a pair had different relevance judgement after the first round of the assessment, a second round of assessment was done after an discussion between the assessors on their individual criteria for the assessment.</p><p>In addition to the reassessment of pairs a second round of assessment on the topic-level was conducted in 2006. This reassessment focused on the topics with the most significant difference in the percentage of the relevant documents between German and English.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Outlook</head><p>Several methods are being investigated to improve the quality of the topic-creation and assessment process. In Order to create topics covering a broader scope of the social sciences as well as realistic information needs it is planned to involve more domain experts into the topic creation process. These experts will be asked for topic proposals in the form of narratives. The most suitable topics from the resulting pool will then be selected and produced as topics conforming to the topic creation guidelines. In order to better verify the topics against the INION and GIRT4 corpora, a new retrieval system will be used which will contain both corpora (deployment planned for autumn of 2006) and will allow also our Russian partner from the Research Computing Center of the M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University to better participate in the topic creation process.</p><p>Concerning the assessment process several methods are evaluated in order to allow the assessors to better coordinate their assessment criteria. Proposed methods include breaking the assessment und reassessment processes into smaller batches of 5 topics or the notification of the assessors in case of notable differences in the results for a topics.</p></div>			</div>
