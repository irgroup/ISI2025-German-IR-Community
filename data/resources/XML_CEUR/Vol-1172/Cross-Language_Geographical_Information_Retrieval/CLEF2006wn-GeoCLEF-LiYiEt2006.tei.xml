<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report on the experiments undertaken by the NICTA I2D2 Group as part of GeoCLEF 2006. We experimented with geographic-based query expansion, using a gazetteer to extend geospatial terms to "nearby" locations, and included sublocations. The processing pipeline of the geographic information retrieval system included: a named entity recognition system for identifying location names; a toponym resolution component for assigning probabilistic likelihoods to geographic candidates obtained from a gazetteer (the Getty Thesaurus); and a probabilistic approach to Geographic Information Retrieval. We experimented with approaches involving expanding location names in both documents and queries. We used a normalization process to adjust term weights to ensure that geographic terms added to a query do not overwhelm the contribution of non-geographic query terms. We submitted five runs to the English-only GeoCLEF monolingual task, ranging from a baseline task of text-only retrieval based on topic title and description, to queries expanded using gazetteer-based toponym resolution. Our submitted runs showed little improvement for GIR runs over the baseline run. A refinement to the normalization process (post-submission) resulted in GIR runs showing 6.57% and 5.84% improvement over the baseline in overall MAP.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Introduction I2D2 (Interactive Information Discovery and Delivery) is a project being undertaken at National ICT Australia (NICTA), with the goal of enhancing user interaction with information hidden in large document collections. A specific focus of I2D2 is in detecting geographically salient relationships, with Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) being an important challenge.</p><p>The system used in the I2D2 2006 submission to GeoCLEF differs significantly from the I2D2 system used in the 2005 submission. We used an updated version of the <ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.34,146.40,55.79,10.46" target="#b3">Zettair [2006]</ref> IR engine as our baseline: this resulted in an increase of baseline MAP scores from 0.2514 to 0.3539 over the GeoCLEF 2005 topics. Other differences included introducing Language Technology components: use of the LingPipe named entity recognition and classification system; and a toponym resolution component. The toponym resolution component assigns probabilistic likelihoods to potential candidate locations for geographic terms identified by LingPipe. Candidates are obtained from a gazetteer; for the GeoCLEF experiments, we used the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. The core retrieval approach involved extending Zettair with a probabilistic technique, described below.</p><p>For the problem of retrieving documents containing locations related to those explicitly mentioned in the query, we experimented with both document expansion and query expansion, that is, replacing geographic terms in documents or queries with a list of related terms, as described below. To combat the drop in precision resulting from geographic expansion, as noted by GeoCLEF 2005 participants (for example, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.00,289.86,87.56,10.46" target="#b0">Gey and Petras [2005]</ref>), we implemented a normalization step to ensure that the added location names do not overwhelm other terms in the topic. The submitted runs used an early version of this normalization; a subsequent refined version saw a significant increase in overall MAP over the non-GIR baseline run.</p><p>Overall, our baseline for the GeoCLEF 2006 topics seemed rather low (MAP=0.2312); adding the geographic retrieval techniques increased overall MAP by 6.57% (document expansion) and 5.84% (query expansion) over the baseline, which is a slight improvement over adding the topic's narrative field to the query. Variation was seen across topics, often depending on the type of geographic reference, and is discussed in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Description</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,119.55,429.44,4.98,10.46" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the architecture of our approach to probabilistic geospatial information retrieval (GIR). There are four steps involved in the process: named entity recognition and classification (NERC); probabilistic toponym resolution (TR); geo-spatial indexing; and retrieval.</p><p>We used a named entity recognition and classification system to differentiate between references to the names of places (which we are interested in), and the names of people and organizations (which we are not). A surprising number of everyday nouns and proper nouns are also geographic entities, for example, the town "Money" in Mississippi. Errors in this part of the pipeline can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the disambiguation process. Our system made use of the LingPipe open-source NERC system, which makes use of a Hidden Markov model trained on a collection of news articles (http://www.alias-i. com/lingpipe/).</p><p>For further system details, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,227.09,549.00,58.11,10.46" target="#b1">Li et al. [2006]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toponym Resolution</head><p>Toponym resolution (TR) is the task of assigning a location to each place name identified by the named entity recognizer. Many place names are ambiguous; context surrounding a place name in the text can be used to determine the correct candidate location. Our approach to TR assigns probability scores to each location candidate of a toponym based on the occurrence of hierarchical associations between place names in the text. Hierarchical associations and location candidates pertaining to a particular geographical reference can be found in a gazetteer resource. For this purpose, we used the Getty Thesaurus, available from http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNServlet. Probabilities are allocated to candidate locations based on a five-level normalization of the gazetteer. For example, a candidate that is classified as a continent or nation receives a significant probability, while a candidate that is classified as an inhabited place (which includes cities) initially receives a much smaller probability, and so on. Initial probability assignments are then adjusted based on a variety of evidence, such as: • Local contextual information: for example, geo-pairs occurring in close proximity to each other, in particular, City, State pairs;</p><p>• Population information, when available;</p><p>• Specified trigger words such as "County" or "River";</p><p>• Global contextual information, such as occurrences in the document of country or state geo-terms that are gazetteer ancestors to the candidate; and</p><p>• Mutual disambiguation across geo-terms: candidates for different geo-terms that are closely related in the gazetteer hierarchy boost each others' probability assignment for their respective terms.</p><p>Final probability assignments are normalized across the complete set of possible candidates for each geoterm.</p><p>We used a hand annotated subset of the GeoCLEF corpus to determine the performance of the Named Entity Classification system, and our toponym disambiguation algorithm. This annotated corpus consisted of 106 Glasgow Herald and 196 LA Times news articles, which contained 2311 tagged locations in total. The overall precision of LingPipe on this dataset was 50% precision and 65% recall, that is, 1502 tags were correctly identified. With respect to disambiguation accuracy our system achieved an accuracy of 90.3% on the 1502 correctly identified LingPipe place names; this gives us an idea of how well our disambiguator would work on 100% accurately NERC tagged data. However, when disambiguation accuracy is calculated with respect to the total number of tagged locations in the dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 60.8%. This indicates that we could make significant gains by improving the performance of the NERC component of our pipeline architecture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probabilistic Geographical IR</head><p>Our Geographical Information Retrieval system involves an extension of <ref type="bibr" coords="3,396.63,678.22,55.62,10.46" target="#b3">Zettair [2006]</ref>, to which we spatial-term indexing. Hierarchically expanded geo-terms (in each case a concatenated string consisting of a candidate and its ancestors in the gazetteer) are added to an index. Geo-tagged queries can then be processed by matching geo-terms in the query to geo-terms in the spatial index.</p><p>The system supports both document expansion and query expansion techniques for matching the location in a query to all its gazetteer children and nearby locations. Document expansion (or redundant indexing) involves adding spatial terms to the index for each of a geo-term's ancestors in the gazetteer hierarchy. Query expansion involves expanding terms in the query. This technique allows more flexible weighting schemes, whereby different weights can be assigned to documents which are more relevant at different hierarchical levels or spatial distances.</p><p>A geo-term in a query expansion may be expanded upwards or downwards. Downward expansion extends the influence of a geo-term to some or all of its descendants in the gazetteer hierarchy to encompass locations that are part of, or subregions of, the specified location. Upward expansion expands the influence of a geo-term to some or all of its ancestors, and then possibly downward to siblings of these This upward-downward expansion facilitates expansion of geo-terms in a query to their nearby locations. For example, downward expansion was used for geo-terms proceeded by an "in" spatial relation, while upward expansion was used for "close/near" relations. Spatial relations such as "in east" or "close west" are not currently handled in our system.</p><p>After expansion, weights are assigned to all expanded geo-terms, reflecting their estimated similarities to the source query geo-term. We used hierarchical distance for downward expansion and spatial distance for upward expansion. Finally, the a priori Okapi BM-25 approach <ref type="bibr" coords="4,361.75,277.91,82.30,10.46" target="#b2">[Walker et al., 1997]</ref> (as implemented in Zettair) is used to calculate the sum of scores for the query. We apply a normalization step to obtain a single score for each location concept by combining the similarity scores of its geo-term, text term, and expanded geo-terms. Without this step, irrelevant documents that contain many of the expanded geo-terms in the query will be incorrectly favored. The contribution of the (potentially numerous) geo-terms added to an expanded query might then overwhelm the contribution of the non-geo terms in the topic.</p><p>For further details of the probabilistic geographical IR approach, see <ref type="bibr" coords="4,380.09,349.64,58.11,10.46" target="#b1">Li et al. [2006]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental Results</head><p>All of our GeoCLEF 2006 submitted runs were based on the Zettair system, some using baseline Zettair and others using the probabilistic IR techniques described in the previous section. The runs submitted were:</p><p>1. MuTdTxt: Baseline Zettair system run on unexpanded queries formed from topic title and description only. All retrieval is purely text-based. We take this to be our baseline.</p><p>2. MuTdnTxt: Baseline Zettair system run on unexpanded queries formed from topic title and description and location words from the narrative field. All retrieval is purely text-based.</p><p>3. MuTdRedn: Baseline Zettair system run on queries formed from topic title and description. Documents are automatically toponym-resolved and expanded with related geo-terms (as described in the previous section). The query (title and description) is automatically annotated and geo-terms are disambiguated, but these terms are not further expanded with (hierarchically) related geo-terms.</p><p>4. MuTdQexpPrb: Probabilistic version of Zettair (as described above). Documents are automatically annotated and disambiguated (that is, toponym resolution is performed) but are not expanded with related geo-terms. Query (title and description) is automatically resolved for geo-terms, and geoterms are expanded with related geo-terms. This is our most complete Geographic IR configuration.</p><p>5. MuTdManQexpGeo: Baseline Zettair using purely text-based retrieval, but for which the query is manually expanded (with related text place-names).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,129.80,648.52,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the overall mean average precision (MAP) scores for the runs submitted to GeoCLEF. These scores are significantly lower than the MAP score obtained by the baseline system (MuTdTxt) run over the GeoCLEF 2005 topics: 0.3539.</p><p>Subsequent to submitting to GeoCLEF 2006, we made some improvements to the normalization step described in Section 2. The results of the same runs as above but using this improved system are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,124.81,708.29,3.74,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. This improvement of the normalization step results in an increase in MAP for the probabilistic runs (MuTdRedn and MuTdQexpPrb).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,132.90,732.21,4.98,10.46">2</ref> displays the Average Precision scores for each topic and for each run, after including the newer, improved normalization step. There is a high degree of variance in the performance obtained across the  set of queries. We plan to undertake a failure-mode analysis to try and ascertain reasons why the toponym resolution did not always yield improved retrieval effectiveness.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,165.11,535.74,3.88,10.46">2</ref>: Average Precision per topic, for each run, using improved normalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>On several topics, Average Precision is very low for all of our runs, including some for which a significant number of documents were deemed relevant: for example, topic 33 (International sports competitions in the Ruhr area) had 20 documents judged as relevant, of which our baseline retrieved only 8. We are currently performing a failure analysis to determine why this is the case.</p><p>Regarding the geographical IR techniques, downward expansion of the query seems to have had a positive effect on some topics, with the normalization step seeming to have alleviated the problem with decreased precision. Topic 26 (Wine regions around rivers in Europe) sees an increase over both baseline and the manually-annotated-query runs. Improvement over baseline was also seen with queries involving spatial relations such as "near" (for example, topic 30, Car bombing near Madrid); and with geographic specialization, such as Northern (for example, topic 42, Regional elections in Northern Germany). Note, however, that our handling of spatial relations did not extend to specific distance specifications, which may have contributed to a slight drop in precision from baseline for topic 27 (Cities within 100km of Frankfurt).</p><p>Also, the automatic GIR approaches resulted in significantly lower AP on topic 42 as compared to using a manually expanded query.</p><p>Other topics for which we saw decreased performance for GIR compared to baseline include those involving general regions that are not expanded in the Getty Thesaurus. Regions such as the Caucasus (topic 39, Russian troops in the southern Caucasus) and Yugoslavia (currently synonymous with Serbia and Montenegro in the Getty Thesaurus, with topic 44 asking about Arms sales in former Yugoslavia) were not handled well. Such non-expanded (in the Getty Thesaurus) general regions were also involved in topics that saw no improvement over very low baseline AP, such as topics 41 (Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean) and 43 (Scientific research in New England Universities). Topic 50 (Cities along the Danube and the Rhine) saw significantly decreased AP as compared to both baseline and the manually-expanded query runs; rivers without a clear central location present a special challenge. We expect topic 33 (International sports competitions in the Ruhr area), while involving a general region not expanded in the Getty Thesaurus, could be handled by transforming in the X area to the form near X.</p><p>Missed recognitions and misclassifications by LingPipe in the queries did not seem to be a significant problem; however, LingPipe's performance on the document collection is more likely to have compromised the GIR runs -this was noted as an area for improvement in Section 2. Interestingly, LingPipe's correct recognition of Southeast Asia in topic 38 (Solar or lunar eclipse in Southeast Asia) probably resulted in worse performance than the alternative of recognizing Asia as a location with the spatial specialization of southeast handled separately, since Southeast Asia does not have an expansion in the Getty Thesaurus.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,171.83,322.02,259.35,10.46"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: Components of the GIR system described in this paper.</figDesc></figure>
