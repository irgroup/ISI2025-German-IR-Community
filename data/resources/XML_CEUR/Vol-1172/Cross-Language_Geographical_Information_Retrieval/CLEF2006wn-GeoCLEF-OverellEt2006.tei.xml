<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper we detail the MMIS team's entry for GeoCLEF 2006. We have two objectives with our entry: to test the accuracy of our co-occurrence model generated from Wikipedia and to test whether the use of large scale co-occurrence models can aid the disambiguation of geographic entities.</p><p>We begin with a discussion of disambiguation methods, followed by a full outline of the system, we then present our experimental runs and results, concluding with an analysis and future work.</p><p>Methods of place name disambiguation can generally be split into three categories:</p><p>• Rule-Based methods, which use a series of hand crafted heuristic rules <ref type="bibr" coords="1,413.53,694.93,10.57,9.96" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,426.50,694.93,7.81,9.96" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,436.70,694.93,12.73,9.96" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,451.91,694.93,12.73,9.96" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,467.15,694.93,12.73,9.96" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,482.28,694.93,12.73,9.96" target="#b17">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,497.52,694.93,11.62,9.96" target="#b19">21]</ref>. • Data Driven methods, which require a large annotated corpus that standard data mining rules can be applied to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.69,372.97,10.45,9.96" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,231.50,372.97,7.05,9.96" target="#b6">7]</ref>. • Semi-Supervised methods, which require a smaller annotated corpus (but multiple examples of each ambiguity) and an additional un-annotated corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,372.67,398.05,10.50,9.96" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,386.52,398.05,12.73,9.96" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.48,398.05,12.73,9.96" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,418.56,398.05,11.62,9.96" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>We use a rule-based approach to annotate how places occur in Wikipedia (taking advantage of structure and meta-data). This annotated corpus is then applied as a co-occurrence model using a data-driven method to annotate the GeoCLEF data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The system</head><p>Our geographic information retrieval system is split into two parts: the indexing stage and the querying stage. The Indexing stage requires the corpus and some external resources to generate the geographic and text indexes (a slow task). The querying stage requires the generated indexes and the queries; it runs in real time.</p><p>The Indexing stage consists of four separate applications: WikiDisambiguator is first used to build a co-occurrence model of how place names occur together in Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.30,556.45,14.60,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>; Disambiguator then applies the co-occurrence model to disambiguate the named entities extracted from the GeoCLEF corpus with Named Entity Recogniser. The disambiguated named entities form the geographic index; Indexer is used to build the text index.</p><p>The Querying stage consists of our Query Engine, which queries the text index and geographic index separately, combining the results (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,298.23,616.21,3.88,9.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">WikiDisambiguator</head><p>Wikipedia is being used more and more in geographic information retrieval, it is extremely useful as a resource due to its size, variation, accuracy and quantity of hyper-links and meta-data. Anyone can contribute articles to Wikipedia meaning the diversity of articles is huge: to date there are over 2 million articles and stubs (short articles) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,307.21,61.33,14.70,9.96">[18]</ref>. In GIR it has been used for corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="3,494.76,61.33,14.60,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, ontology <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.53,73.33,9.91,9.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, gazetteer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.20,73.33,10.45,9.96" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,208.09,73.33,7.81,9.96" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.21,73.33,12.73,9.96" target="#b13">14]</ref> and ground truth <ref type="bibr" coords="3,319.85,73.33,15.61,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref> generation. The places extracted from Wikipedia are correlated with the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), a gazetteer listing approximately 800,000 places.</p><p>WikiDisambiguator is the application designed to build our co-occurrence model. The data gathered (collected from a crawl of every Wikipedia article 1 ) takes the form of three database tables: links believed to be places and the order in which they occur; links believed to be nonplaces and the order in which they occur and a mapping of Wikipedia articles to TGN unique identifiers.</p><p>WikiDisambiguator uses rule-based methods of disambiguation. It is made up of two parts, the disambiguation framework and the method of disambiguation itself. Using Wikipedia as the corpus solves two problems: the problem of synonyms (multiple words referring to a single entity) is resolved as we can record how multiple anchor texts point to the same page; and the problem of polynyms (a single word referring to multiple places) can be solved with our disambiguation system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">The disambiguation framework</head><p>The disambiguation framework is a simple framework to allow independent disambiguation methods to be slotted in.</p><p>The framework is outlined as follows:</p><p>1: The Wikipedia articles are loaded from the database 2: for each Wikipedia article all the links are extracted 3: for each link 4:</p><p>if it has already been disambiguated as not a place 5:</p><p>then add an entry to the db and continue 6:</p><p>if the page pointed to has already been disambiguated as a place 7:</p><p>then add an entry to the db and continue 8:</p><p>else attempt to disambiguate using the Method of Disambiguation specified 9: end for 10: end for The disambiguation methods is passed:</p><p>• a list of candidate places • a list of names of places related to this link • the text making up the article that this link points to • the article title • how the link appeared in the text The candidate places are taken from the Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Names. The candidate places for an article are places matching either the article's title or the anchor text linking to the article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Our method of disambiguation</head><p>Based on the results observed by running a series of simple disambiguation methods on test data, we designed a disambiguation pipeline that could exploit the meta-data contained in Wikipedia and strike a balance between precision and recall <ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.85,636.73,14.60,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Each disambiguation method is called in turn (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,345.53,648.73,3.88,9.96" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A list of candidate places is maintained for each article, an article is denoted as unambiguous when this list contains one or zero elements. Each method of disambiguation can act on the candidate places list in the following 2. Disambiguate with categories -The category information from Wikipedia contains softer information than the template information <ref type="bibr" coords="4,304.72,385.33,10.00,9.96" target="#b8">[9]</ref>; the purpose of assigning documents to categories is to denote associations between documents (rather than template information which is intended to display information in a uniform manner). Category tags can identify the country or continent of an article or indicate an article is not referring to a place.</p><p>3. Disambiguate with referents -Often in articles describing a place, a parent place will be mentioned (e.g. when describing a town, mention the county or country). The first paragraph of the document is searched for containing places. This method of disambiguation has been shown to have a suitably high percentage or precision (places correctly identified) and grounding (places correctly matched to unique identifiers) of 87% and 95% respectively <ref type="bibr" coords="4,494.76,488.89,14.60,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>4. Disambiguate with Text Heuristics -Our heuristic method is based on the hypothesis When describing an important place<ref type="foot" coords="4,242.88,520.05,3.97,6.37" target="#foot_0">2</ref> , only places of equal or greater importance are used as referrers. This hypothesis is implemented as follows:</p><p>1: All the place names are extracted from the first paragraph of the document 2: for each possible location of the ambiguous place 3: Sum the distance between the possible location and the extracted locations that are more important than this one. 4: end for 5: return the place with the minimal sum</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Named Entity Recogniser</head><p>News articles have a large number of references to named entities that quickly place the reader into the context of the news piece. Sometimes the same named entity is referred to in different ways (e.g. "British prime minister", "Mr. Blair", "Tony Blair"). Thus, the detection of references to all named entities is the problem that we addressed in this part of the system. This part receives as input the GeoCLEF news articles and outputs the named entities of each news article, which will be used by the Disambiguator.</p><p>Named entity recognition systems rely on lexicons and textual patterns either manually crafted or learnt from a training set of documents. We used the ESpotter named entity recognition system proposed by Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,195.98,133.09,14.60,9.96" target="#b18">[20]</ref>. Currently, ESpotter recognises people, organisations, locations, research areas, email addresses, telephone numbers, postal codes, and other proper names. ESpotter has the particularity of supporting domains of interest. First it infers the domain of the document (e.g. computer science, sports, politics) to adapt the lexicon and patterns for a more specialised named entity recognition which will result in a high precision and recall.</p><p>ESpotter uses a database to store the lexicon and the textual pattern information. It can be easily customised to recognise any type of entities one might be interested in by adding new lexicon and textual patterns. The database we used is the one supplied by Zhu et al., we did not create a database of GeoCLEF based lexicon and patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">News articles indexing</head><p>The news article corpus was indexed with Apache Lucene 2.0 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,362.64,275.05,9.91,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which was later used to search the article corpus. The information retrieval model we used was the vector space model without term frequencies (binary term weight). This decision was due to the small size of each document that could cause a large bias for some terms. Terms are extracted from the news corpus in the following way:</p><p>1. Split words at punctuation characters, removing punctuation; however, a dot that's not followed by whitespace is considered part of a term;</p><p>2. Split words at hyphens and generate a term: unless there is a number in the term, in which case the whole term is interpreted as a product number and is not split 3. Recognise email addresses and internet host names as one term 4. Remove every stop word 5. Index a document by its extract terms (lowercase)</p><p>See <ref type="bibr" coords="5,107.76,470.29,10.45,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Disambiguator</head><p>To allow the returned results to be pruned geographically the data needs to be geographically indexed. We take the named entities tagged as locations output by the Named Entity Recogniser and disambiguate them based on how they co-occur in our co-occurrence model.</p><p>Having the corpus indexed with place names, we could apply our co-occurrence model to disambiguate the places to distinct locations as listed in the Getty TGN. Our method is a Naïve Bayesian approach designed to maximise speed and implemented in the application Disambiguator.</p><p>1: for all documents 2: for each adjacent tuple of place names 3:</p><p>for each possible location for either place name 4:</p><p>disambiguate as the places that most often appear together 5:</p><p>end for 6: end for 7: end for Possible locations are defined as any location appearing in our co-occurrence model that has been referred to by the same toponym as the named entity extracted from the corpus. The geographic index is then stored in a Postgres database and indexed with an R-Tree (to allow efficient processing of spatial queries) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,261.36,97.21,10.57,9.96" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,276.36,97.21,11.62,9.96" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In previous experiments we have shown the cooccurrence model to be accurate to within 80% <ref type="bibr" coords="6,297.60,109.21,14.60,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, in this experiment we assume the geographic index to have an accuracy equal to or less than this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Query Engine</head><p>The Query Engine is the application used to prune the results of the text queries produced by Lucene using the geographic queries.</p><p>The queries are manually split into a text component and a geographic component. The text query is handled normally by Lucene, the geographic query is manually split into a tree of conjunctions and disjunctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Executing a text query</head><p>Once the news articles are indexed with Lucene, the query terms will be extracted in the same way that the document terms were, a similarity measure is taken between the query's terms and all indexed documents. The similarity function is given by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,192.36,303.69,214.35,32.26">score(q, d) = t∈d tf t (d) • idf 2 (d ∋ t, D) • norm(d) t∈d tf 2 t (d)</formula><p>, where t∈d tf t (d) is the t term frequency for the given document d (in our case is 0 or 1), idf(d ∋ t, D) is the frequency of documents d containing the term t in the D collection, and norm(d) is a normalization constant given by the total number of terms in document d. See <ref type="bibr" coords="6,502.43,372.25,10.57,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">The query tree</head><p>The query trees are constructed by hand. The nodes of the tree are either conjunctions or disjunctions while the leaves of the tree are (spatial-relation, location) pairs see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,458.89,440.41,3.90,9.96">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.3">Executing a query</head><p>For each document that matches the text query we check whether it refers to a place matching the geographic query -any documents not matching the geographic query are removed (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,497.29,496.69,3.88,9.96">4</ref>).</p><p>1: fetch all documents that satisfy the text query from Lucene 2: for all documents 3: prune results against the geographic query 4: end for 5: return remaining documents</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experimental runs</head><p>We entered two runs for GeoCLEF 2006: Both were mono-lingual, English queries on an English corpus with manually constructed queries. Our first run used queries constructed from the title and description, the second run also took into account the narrative. As far as was possible we attempted to add no world knowledge, the query trees we produced resembled what could be produced with a query parser.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>Our runs appeared between the 25% quantile and the median for mean average precision (see table below). The run consisting of queries constructed from Title, Description and Narrative (TDN) generally out performed the run constructed from Title and Description (TD); in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,492.38,432.25,4.98,9.96" target="#fig_3">5</ref> we compare the average precision of our runs for each query against the maximum average precision achieved by any system. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>Our system as presented here uses a simple approach to the application of co-occurrence models for place name disambiguation, text indexing and the combination of text and geographic queries.</p><p>The system gave results appearing slightly below the median MAP; this shows the system model is valid; however, there is significant room for improvement. Without further tests we cannot comment on specific parts of the system; each of the five applications will have to be tuned independently.</p><p>With respect to our objectives we can conclude that the co-occurrence model accuracy agrees with the previous experiments conducted in <ref type="bibr" coords="8,291.02,647.89,15.49,9.96" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and that co-occurrence models are a suitable method of place name disambiguation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,247.80,329.17,107.54,9.96;2,116.64,58.94,369.60,245.90"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: System Design</figDesc><graphic coords="2,116.64,58.94,369.60,245.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The three methods currently being worked on are:</p><p>• Using a generalised Jaccard co-efficient to produce a co-occurrence index • Learning a hierarchical decision list • Applying Latent Semantic Indexing to build place-name neighbourhoods</p><p>We hope after a study of these methods to evaluate the suitability of using co-occurrence models for place-name evaluation and to identify the optimal method.</p><p>ESpotter utilises an Access database for Named Entity Recognition; we would like to see if it is possible to optimise this database for use with the GeoCLEF corpus and general place name recognition.</p><p>Lucene was applied in the default configuration and the text part of the queries were not altered in any way. We plan to experiment with suitable query weights for Lucene and try alternative configurations of the index. Ultimately we would like to combine the geographic and text indexes so that they can be searched and applied simultaneously.</p><p>We also plan to implement a query parser to allow the queries to automatically be parsed into query trees; this would require a level of natural language processing.</p></div>			</div>
