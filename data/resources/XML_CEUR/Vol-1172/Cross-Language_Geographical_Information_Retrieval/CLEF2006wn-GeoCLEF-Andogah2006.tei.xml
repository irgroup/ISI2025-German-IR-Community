<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) community has generally accepted the thesis that both thematic and geographic aspect of documents may be useful for GIR. This paper describes a preliminary experiment exploring this thesis by seperately indexing/searching geographical relevant-terms (place names, geo-spatial relations, geographic concepts and geographic adjacetives) extracted from reference document collection. Two indexes were created one for extracted geographic relevant-terms (i.e. document footprint) and one for reference document collections. Geo-Score and Thematic-Score against document collection footprint and reference document collection respectively were combined through a linear interpolation to obtained the final score for document relevance ranking. We used several freely available geographic resources -Wikipedia, World-Gazetteer, GEOnet Name Server (GNS), and WordNet. Apache Lucene was used as an indexing and search platform while Alias-I LingPipe was used to detect geographic named entities (GNEs), and other geo-relevant concepts and terms in documents. We submitted runs for monolingual English task, and our system achieved mean average precision (MAP) of 0.1690 to 0.2194. No significant improvement was observed through geographic query expansion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) concerns the retrieval of information involving some kind of spatial awareness. Geographic information pervades many documents, and therefore, geographic references may be important for Information Retrieval (IR). Additionally, many documents contain geographic references expressed in multiple languages which may or may not be the same as the query language.</p><p>To perform GIR both themetic (non-geographic aspect) and geographic aspect of documents require consideration. In order to approach this thesis we derive for each document in the collection a corresponding document footprint containing place names (e.g. Uganda), geo-spatial relations (e.g. west of), geographic concepts (e.g. country) and geographic adjectives (e.g. Ugandan). The document footprint and reference document collection provided were separately indexed and searched. Geo-Score and Thematic-Score against document collection footprint and reference document collection were combined through a linear interpolation to obtained the final score to perform document relevance ranking. Queries were performed for geographic relevant terms identified in topics against document collection footprints and reference document collection provided to investigate impart of geo-references and geo-relevant terms for GIR.</p><p>Freely available geographic resources (from: Wikipedia<ref type="foot" coords="2,351.00,253.59,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , World-Gazetteer<ref type="foot" coords="2,435.36,253.59,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , GEOnet Name Server<ref type="foot" coords="2,117.36,265.47,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> (GNS), WordNet<ref type="foot" coords="2,202.20,265.47,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> ) were consulted for query geographic reference expansion. Apache Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="2,120.60,277.47,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref> was used as an indexing and search platform while Alias-I LingPipe<ref type="foot" coords="2,424.56,277.47,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> was used to detect geographic named entities (GNEs) and other geo-relevant concepts and terms in documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">GeoCLEF 2006</head><p>GeoCLEF evaluation track was run for the first time at CLEF 2005 to evaluate retrieval of multilingual documents with an emphasis on geographic search <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.32,357.55,71.12,9.96" target="#b2">[Gey et al, 2005]</ref>. As GeoCLEF 2005, GeoCLEF 2006 outline the following challenges to GIR in a multilingual environment: (1) translation of locations (e.g. Uganda (EN) to Oeganda (NL)), (2) resolution of geographic reference ambiguities (e.g. "Jack London" the author not a place; South Yorkshire and S. Yorks refer to the same place), (3) resolution of spatial ambiguity (e.g. Sheffield in UK or USA), (4) finding or creating suitable multilingual geographic knowledge base, and (5) combining both text and spatial retrieval methods. The specific aims for GeoCLEF 2006 are: (1) compare methods of query translation, (2) query expansion, (3) translation of geographical references, (4) use of text and spatial retrieval methods separately or combined, and (5) retrieval models and indexing methods.</p><p>GeoCLEF 2006 consists of document collections in English, German, Portuguese and Spanish, and 25 search topics in these languages. The tasks for GeoCLEF 2006 are: (1) monolingual retrieval -retrieval where the topic and document languages are the same, and (2) bilingual retrieval -cross-language retrieval where the topic language is different from the document language, i.e. X → {DE, EN, ES, PT}. For each document language, participants may submit the results of up to 10 runs: 5 monolingual and 5 bilingual. Two of these runs are required: (1) Title-Descriptionwhere the search queries are created using only the contents of the Title and Desc tags of the topic, and (2) Title-Description-Narrative -where the search queries are created using the contents of the Title, Desc and Narr tags from the topic. The Narrative tag contains a more comprehensive description of the information request defined by the topic, including specifics about the geography of the topic such as a list of desired cities, states, countries, rivers or latitudes and longitudes. An example search topic is depicted below: &lt;top&gt; &lt;num&gt;GC027&lt;/num&gt; &lt;EN-title&gt;Cities within 100km of Frankfurt&lt;/EN-title&gt; &lt;EN-desc&gt;Documents about cities within 100 kilometers of the city of Frankfurt in Western Germany&lt;/EN-desc&gt; &lt;EN-narr&gt;Relevant documents discuss cities within 100 kilometers of Frankfurt am Main Germany, latitude 50.11222, longitude 8.68194. To be relevant the document must describe the city or an event in that city. Stories about Frankfurt itself are not relevant&lt;/EN-narr&gt; &lt;/top&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Previous works</head><p>GeoCLEF 2005 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,159.40,202.03,70.48,9.96" target="#b2">[Gey et al, 2005]</ref> featured several approaches to GIR: (1) conventional IR systems, (2) geographic named entity recognition, classification and real world resolution, (3) creation and expansion of geographic knowledge base (e.g. name variants, multilingual), (4) query expansion strategies -blind feedback, addition of proper names, geographic reference expansion using hierarchical information contained in GKB, (5) geo-spatial query restriction strategies -minimum bounding box based, geo-scope based, and (6) topic translation strategies mainly employing usage of off-shelf software packages. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,105.00,285.79,59.45,9.96">Larson [2005]</ref> provided three Lucene index types: verified place names (an index of names which matched the gazetteer entries), point coordinates (latitude and longitude coordinates of the verified place name) and bounding box coordinates (bounding boxes for the matched places from gazetteer). Text indexes were also created for separate XML elements (such as document titles or dates) as well as for the entire document. The authors found blind feedback to improve query results.</p><p>Ferres et al <ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.79,357.55,25.64,9.96">[2005]</ref> provided a Lucene derived Document Retrieval component which extracted relevant documents likely to contain the user information in the query. The Document Retrieval phase provides for: (1) query type (boolean query, ranked query, boolean+ranked query), (2) geographic search mode (lemma field and geo field), and (3) geographical search policy (strict search and relaxed search). Document ranking component joins the documents provided by the Document Retrieval phase. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,105.00,429.19,62.21,9.96" target="#b13">Hughes [2005]</ref> describe loosely aggregated system for GIR comprising of gazetteer, named entity taggers and conventional IR system. The topic and document (headlines only) collections were geographical resolved by using the named entity taggers and gazetteer. This analysis allows for expansion or reduction of geospatial entities by hierarchy traversal in the gazetteer. Document collections (textual content only) were then indexed. The difference of this experiment is in the inclusion of various parts of the topics and the level of geospatial entity expansion based on the topic to geospatial entity mapping tables. However, the author found no overall performance increase by use of topics expanded with geospatial entities over the baseline topics.</p><p>Buscaldi et al <ref type="bibr" coords="3,167.11,524.83,25.64,9.96">[2005]</ref> describes a query expansion method based on the expansion of geographical terms by means of WordNet synonyms and meronyms. Examples of geographic synonyms: Rome (EN) and Roma (IT), U.S and U.S.A (acronyms), etc. Examples of geographic meronyms: Washington referencing U.S.A, Paris without France explicitly mentioned in the context, thus resolved to Paris, France because assumed to be well-known. The WordNet resolves synonyms through synset and meronyms through part-of relationship. The authors noted that query expansion did not provide a clear advantage and actual performed worse compared conventional search strategies. One probable reason is that the query expansion could have introduced unnecessary information. However, using WordNet synonyms and holonyms during indexing proved useful with better performance. A named entity detector was used to recognize location named entities. For every location name l, the synonyms of l and all its holonyms (e.g. Los Angeles → California → United States → North America → America) are added to the geo index.</p><p>Berkeley group 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,182.32,668.35,100.34,9.96" target="#b2">[Gey and Vivien, 2005]</ref> retrieval strategy involved query augmentation with blind feedback. Another feature of their approach is the augmentation of query information by inclusion of location-specific tags and expansion of geographic references (e.g. Europe to individual country names). The blind feedback approach adds 30 top-ranked terms to the query from the top 20 ranked documents of intial ranking. Manual expansion of geographic references proved disastrous to retrieval performance. Addition of concepts and location imformation improved retrieval precisions across. Most improvement was achieved with blind feedback by adding mostly proper names and word variations and very few irrelevant words that won't distort the search towards another direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Our appraoch</head><p>We are participating in GeoCLEF evaluation track at CLEF 2006 for the first time. The main motivation for our participation is to experiment with both thematic and geographic aspect of a document for GIR. In this section we describe our approach, system architecture and resources used. Our appraoch borrows techniques from <ref type="bibr" coords="4,293.83,214.03,61.51,9.96">(Larson [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,363.12,214.03,77.93,9.96" target="#b10">Ferres et al [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,448.83,214.03,59.96,9.96" target="#b13">Hughes [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,90.00,226.03,90.90,9.96" target="#b14">Buscaldi et al [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,189.63,226.03,99.64,9.96" target="#b2">Gey and Vivien [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,297.90,226.03,62.57,9.96" target="#b9">Leidner [2005]</ref>) with few exceptions such as the creation of an index of document collection footprint along side the index of reference document collection, and thereby combining query results of the two index searches using linear interpolation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Geographic Knowledge Base</head><p>We used the World Gazetteer, GEOnet Names Server (GNS), Wikipedia and WordNet as the bases for our Geographic Knowledge Base (GKB) for several reasons -free availability, multilingual (English, Germany, Portuguese and Spanish), most popular and major places, etc. Volcano active region, European river, Atlantic Ocean ports/coast and European Wine processing region information were specifically gathered from the Wikipedia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">GeoTagger</head><p>Alias-I LingPipe was used to detect named entities (location, person and organisation), geographic concepts (continent, region, country, city, town, village, etc.), spatial relations (near, in, south of, north west, etc.) and locative adjectives (e.g. Ugandan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">GeoCoder</head><p>We used a simple appraoch to geo-code identified geographic named entities (GNEs) presented in CLIN 2005 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,154.86,486.79,69.93,9.96" target="#b7">[Andogah, 2005]</ref>. The approach exploits location type (e.g. city, mountain) and hierarchy information integrated in GKB to ground GNEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Lucene Search Engine</head><p>Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform. Lucene's default similarity measure is based on vector space model<ref type="foot" coords="4,450.72,565.59,3.95,6.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref> (VSM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Document Pre-processing</head><p>Documents were pre-processed using the Alias-I LingPipe to detect place names (e.g. Kampala), geographic concepts (e.g. city), spatial relations (e.g. west of) and adjectives referring to things or people or language connected to a place (e.g. Ugandan).</p><p>Candidate locations for detected place names is obtained from our GKB. Place names are resolved to their respective locations using a simple geo-coding approach exploiting location type and hierarchical information present in GKB. The preliminary experimental result of geo-coding approach used here was reported in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,245.02,685.03,70.25,9.96" target="#b7">[Andogah, 2005]</ref> 8 . However, due to time limitation geo-coding task was not experimented as planned, instead we assume that all geo-relevant terms detected in a document will some-how relate or point to a specific geographic region/scope or geographic concept in the discourse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Indexing document collection</head><p>Footprint document collection repository derived from document collection was created. Footprint documents contain geo-relevant terms such as place name, geographic concepts, spatial relations, locative adjectives plus their respective term frequency as depicted below.</p><p>&lt;GeographicTermFrequency docid="GH950102-000006"&gt; &lt;GT name="east" tf="2" gtt="SPR" /&gt; &lt;GT name="america" tf="1" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="new york" tf="2" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="buffalo" tf="3" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="orlando magic" tf="1" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="american" tf="4" gtt="GAD" /&gt; &lt;GT name="texas" tf="1" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="buffalo jills" tf="1" gtt="LOC" /&gt; &lt;GT name="city" tf="1" gtt="GCO" /&gt; &lt;/GeographicTermFrequency&gt; Derived footprint documents were indexed using Lucene along side index of reference document collection provided for the experiment (see [Table <ref type="table" coords="5,312.77,368.95,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>] for details). Geo-relevant term frequency is factored into the index by adding the same geo-relevant-term to the index the number of times it occurences (e.g. american in the above sample footprint document is added 4 times during indexing).</p><p>Reference document collection provided for experimentation were indexed using Lucene. Document HEADLINE and TEXT contents were combined to created document content for indexing (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,110.02,603.19,37.35,9.96">[Table 2</ref>] for details).   <ref type="table" coords="6,142.03,390.19,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref>] for index structure and [Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,291.56,390.19,3.90,9.96">1</ref>] for system architecture). The mandatory queries perform general-purpose search of Lucene index returning the top 1,000 documents retrieve. Our third run query was formulated by topic TITLE-DESC only (CLCGGeoEE5). The query was submitted to search Lucene index (Lucene field nm was searched) of GEO-CLEF 2006 document collection footprints (see [Table <ref type="table" coords="6,252.46,438.07,3.90,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>] for index structure and [Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,398.02,438.07,3.90,9.96">1</ref>] for system architecture), and the top 1,000 documents retrieved.</p><p>Our fourth run (CLCGGeoEE10) combine run 2 query result with result of querying Lucene index of GEO-CLEF 2006 document collection footprints for geo-relevant-terms extracted from topic TITLE-DESC-NARR. To combine the result of run 2 with result of querying Lucene index of document collection footprints we used the linear interpolation as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,445.64,497.83,62.99,9.96" target="#b9">[Leidner, 2005]</ref>. Score(d, q) = λT hematicScore(d, q) + (1λ)GeoScore <ref type="bibr" coords="6,408.14,521.71,25.02,9.96">(d, q)</ref> (1)</p><p>For this experimentλ was set to 0.5. Our fifth run (CLCGGeoEE11) is similar to run four except that geo-revelant-terms extracted from topic TITLE-DESC-NARR were augmented with geo-references obtain from our GKB. For example, topic G033 geo-relevant-terms were augmented with the names of the major cities/towns/places within Ruhr area of Germany -Bochum, Bottrop, Dortmund, Duisburg, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Hagen, Hamm, Herne, Mlheim, Oberhausen, Recklinghausen, Ennepe-Ruhr, Unna, Wesel, Mlheim an der Ruhr, Mulheim an der Ruhr.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Discussion and future work</head><p>Several factors might have influenced the performance of these schemes (CLCGGeoEE5, CLCGGeoEE10 &amp; CLCGGeoEE11):</p><p>• predominance of geographic concepts and spatial-relationship qualifiers such as country, city, southern, west, etc. both in the query and document footprints at expense of place names, and thereby shifting query result in wrong direction propagating irrelevant documents to the top</p><p>• value of 0.5 asigned to λ in linear interpolation [Equation ( <ref type="formula" coords="8,369.04,293.11,3.87,9.96">1</ref>)] above might have tilted result by asigning higher scores to documents retrieved from reference document collection or vice versa, and thereby propagating irrelevant documents to the top in the final rank</p><p>• not all documents were indexed as our adopted geographic named entity tagger (Alias-i Lingpipe) reported content error for certain files while processing reference collection files. As a result 51,525 Glasgow Heralds documents were indexed out of 56,472 and 112,552 LA Times documents were indexed out of 113,005. This might have had a considerable impart on query result as 5,400 documents (which might have contained relevant documents) were left out.</p><p>The results of our submitted runs raised several pertinent questions for future investigation:</p><p>• extend to which geographic aspect of document influence GIR result: (1) querying topic geographic aspect against reference document collection, (2) querying topic non-geographic aspect against reference document</p><p>• an appropriate value for λ in linear interpolation [Equation (1)] above for GIR</p><p>• an appropriate document collection footprint indexing strategy</p><p>• improve geographic named entity recognition, classification and real world resolution</p><p>• geographic query expansion strategies -blind feedback, addition of place names, expansion through hierarchical information contain in GKB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Concluding remarks</head><p>We employed a strategy of separately indexing document footprint along side index of reference document, and combine query results of the two indexes through linear interpolation. Our approach yielded an average result as compared to overall GeoCLEF 2006 result on monolingual English task. A number of pertinent questions were raised for future investigation which we hope to address and integrate in our system. Analysis of individual topic performance to give further insight in our approach is under way.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,236.52,304.15,130.08,9.96"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: System architecture</figDesc></figure>
