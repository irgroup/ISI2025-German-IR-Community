<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The German question answering (QA) system InSicht participated in QA@CLEF for the third time. In-Sicht realizes a deep (or semantic) approach because it builds on full sentence parses, inferences on semantic representations, and matching between semantic representations derived from questions and document sentences. For QA@CLEF 2005, a coreference resolution module was integrated and several large knowledge bases containing relations between lexical concepts were added <ref type="bibr" coords="2,364.64,187.81,71.56,8.64" target="#b1">(Hartrumpf, 2006)</ref>. These knowledge bases were derived mainly from nominal compound analyses. InSicht was improved in the following directions for QA@CLEF 2006: temporal expressions are better normalized and temporal deictic expressions are resolved to explicit date representations (Sect. 2.1); the coreference module was extended by a fallback strategy for increased robustness (Sect. 2.2); equivalence rules can now introduce negative information that should not occur in document sentences used for answering questions (Sect. 2.3); answer candidates are clustered in order to avoid multiple occurrences of one real-world entity in the answers to a list question (Sect. 2.4); and finally a shallow QA subsystem that produces a second answer stream was integrated into InSicht (Sect. 2.5).</p><p>2 Improvements over the System for QA@CLEF 2005</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Temporal Expressions</head><p>As many questions are related to temporal expressions, InSicht was extended to use not just explicit temporal expressions like before September 18, 2005 and in 2001 but also deictic expressions like today or 2 years ago. To this end, around 40 MultiNet rules <ref type="bibr" coords="2,287.17,398.62,59.51,8.64" target="#b3">(Helbig (2006)</ref> describes the MultiNet semantic network formalism in detail) were developed which resolve temporal deictic expressions into explicit forms. For a wider perspective on indexicals (or deictic expressions) in general with their classificatory, relational, and deictic components, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.39,437.72,64.42,8.64" target="#b5">(Nunberg, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Before the rules can be applied one must determine for each document the date it was published. The special variable ?now, which is used in many deixis resolution rules, contains this value. The date encoded in the document identifier was taken as a starting point, which was refined (if possible) by looking for a date given at the start of the article text. In 61.4% of the articles, the date could be determined from the text; in the remaining 38.6% (which all came from the FR subcorpus and not the other subcorpora SDA and SPIEGEL), the document identifier was used as the fallback strategy. Currently, the SGML attribute DATE (DT, WEEK ) is not used because it is often inaccurate: the FR subcorpus contains only a WEEK attribute which corresponds to the Sunday or Monday starting the week. For the SDA subcorpus, the identification method from article text yields the same results as the DT attribute.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,133.28,568.03,4.98,8.64">1</ref> shows two examples of deixis resolution rules that InSicht applies in the document processing step. The rules are transformation rules that can introduce new relations and delete existing relations (operation: $delete). Variables start with a question mark; by convention, node (relation) variables are of the form ?n (?r) followed by an integer, e.g. ?n1 and ?r1 in the first premise term of rule deixis.übermorgen. In addition to testing the presence or absence of a relation and testing the value of a node feature (e.g. the MultiNet layer feature CARD), the premise can also contain some predefined declarative predicates (e.g. the member predicate in the example rules). On the conclusion side, the value of node variables can be stated by constants or by functional expressions (e.g. functions for calculating with dates like plus-days, functions for accessing components of a date like date-day, and week-aware rounding functions like wdayround-down).</p><p>In addition to rules that directly introduce canonical date representations (details below the resolution of days are currently ignored because they seem to be less prominent in questions over newspaper and newswire articles), some preparatory normalization rules were needed. Examples are the adjectives that correspond to deictic adverbs, e.g. the adjective morgig corresponding to the adverb morgen/'tomorrow'. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,90.00,109.17,27.93,8.64;3,99.96,121.13,110.47,8.64">((rule ( (?r1 ?n1 "übermorgen.1.1")</ref>  (?r1 ?n1 ?n6) (attr ?n6 ?n7) (sub ?n7 "jahr.1.1") (val ?n7 ?n8) (card ?n8 (date-year (wday-round-down ?now ?n5 ?n4))) (attr ?n6 ?n9) (sub ?n9 "monat.1.1") (val ?n9 ?n10) (card ?n10 (date-month (wday-round-down ?now ?n5 ?n4))) (attr ?n6 ?n11) (sub ?n11 "tag.1.1") (val ?n11 ?n12) (card ?n12 (date-day (wday-round-down ?now ?n5 ?n4))))) (name "deixis.weekday+pmod.past"))</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,119.19,525.61,3.88,8.64">1</ref>: Two simplified rules for resolving temporal deixis. The concepts jahr.1.1 ('year'), monat.1.1 ('month'), and tag.1.1 ('day') are attributes used in normalized date representations with MultiNet.</p><p>The semantic representations of these adjectives are currently flat in the sense that they are equal to the ones of other operational qualities. Therefore, preparatory normalization rules introduce the temporal interpretation of these adjectives, e.g. for das morgige Treffen/'tomorrow's meeting' a temporal relation TEMP from treffen.1.1 to morgen.1.1. The newly introduced temporal concepts like morgen.1.1 are then in turn normalized by rules like the rule deixis.übermorgen.1.1 in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,377.64,621.73,3.74,8.64">1</ref>. Note that the rules can be easily transferred to other languages because they work on semantic representations of the MultiNet formalism. Only some lexical concepts (like week days) must be translated; if one already has a mapping between the involved lexicons, rules can be translated automatically for the use in another language.</p><p>For some sentences, the deictic expression has been introduced by the prepositional phrase interpretation. For example, the vor-PP in the noun phrase das Konzert vor 20 Tagen ('the concert 20 days ago') introduces an artificial concept now.0 (besides a relation to the semantic representation of 20 days) that needs to be resolved by using the notion of publication date mentioned above.</p><p>The ten most successful deixis resolution rules (i.e. the ten rules that fired most often for semantic networks of document sentences) are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,288.25,739.01,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The percentages of rule application for successful (or The peace treaty was signed yesterday. to find an answer. For related work, see for example <ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.72,613.10,89.81,8.64" target="#b6">Pan and Hobbs (2005)</ref> who briefly describe a rule-based translation from the output of an English semantic parser to an OWL-Time representation for temporal expressions, especially temporal aggregates. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,223.17,639.16,100.79,8.64" target="#b4">Mani and Wilson (2000)</ref> cover with their system similar cases like the deixis resolution rules in InSicht but their system looks for lexical and syntactic clues based on part-ofspeech tags and does not build on semantic representations derived from full syntactico-semantic parsing like InSicht does. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,166.55,678.26,107.74,8.64" target="#b7">Schilder and Habel (2001)</ref> describe a system for German financial news that extracts temporal information based on a part-of-speech tagger and specialized finite state transducers. In contrast to <ref type="bibr" coords="4,100.66,704.32,97.44,8.64" target="#b4">Mani and Wilson (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,205.27,704.32,106.68,8.64" target="#b7">Schilder and Habel (2001)</ref> and InSicht's approach also take into account the semantics of prepositional phrases (see <ref type="bibr" coords="4,247.87,717.35,95.37,8.64" target="#b2">(Hartrumpf et al., 2006)</ref> for details on the underlying prepositional phrase interpretation in InSicht's parser). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Robust Coreference Resolution</head><p>As only 45% of the texts received a partition from the coreference resolution module CORUDIS <ref type="bibr" coords="5,467.17,409.11,47.86,8.64;5,90.00,422.14,23.24,8.64" target="#b1">(Hartrumpf, 2006)</ref> (mainly because of parameter settings that allow efficient coreference resolution for the 277,000 texts (without duplicates) in the QA@CLEF corpus), a fallback strategy was added to InSicht. If no partition of mentions (markables) can be found by CORUDIS, a fallback partition of mentions is calculated as follows. All pronouns are resolved to their most likely antecedents (as estimated by CORUDIS); all other mentions are ignored, i.e. each of these mentions ends up in a singleton set, which is an element of the fallback partition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Negative Information for Network Matching</head><p>The open world assumption (OWA) in semantic network representations can be problematic if the query expansion step produces semantic networks that are similar to the original question network but a little bit less specific. For example, InSicht employs a rule named drop.first name that drops the first name of a person if the last name is also in the question (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,325.97,575.91,3.60,8.64">2</ref>). Without additional measures, the resulting additional query network will also match a document network containing a first name, even though this first name might differ from the one in the original question.</p><p>Therefore rules can introduce negative information. In the given example of rule drop.first name, the conclusion specifies the term (no-rel ?n1 "vorname.1.1"), which means that the node variable of the person (where the first name has been deleted by this rule, ?n1 ) should not contain any (direct or indirect) relation to a first name (vorname.1.1) in a document network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Answer Clustering</head><p>The QA system InSicht worked without investigating the relationship between answer candidates in previous years; it only combined identical answer candidates into one answer candidate with an increased frequency score that influenced answer selection. But as InSicht was extended to answer list questions, clustering became unavoidable because otherwise the system could give many answers (meant as different <ref type="bibr" coords="6,90.00,109.17,27.93,8.64;6,99.96,121.13,44.26,8.64">((rule ( (sub ?n1 ?)</ref> (attr ?n1 ?n2) (sub ?n2 "nachname.1.1") (val ?n2 ?) (attr ?n1 ?n3) (sub ?n3 "vorname.1.1") (val ?n3 ?n4) → ($delete (attr ?n1 ?n3)) ($delete (sub ?n3 "vorname.1.1")) ($delete (val ?n3 ?n4)) (no-rel ?n1 "vorname.1.1"))) (name "drop first name") (quality 0.6))</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,119.27,262.60,3.88,8.64">2</ref>: A transformation rule that introduces negative information. The variable ? is the anonymous variable.</p><p>entities on the answer list) which all refer to the same entity. For example, if one asks for the president of a country, one could receive one person in many forms: with all first names, with some first names, with initials, only last name, etc.</p><p>Non-identical answer candidates a and b are clustered together if a is a substring of b, possibly with additional interleaving characters. For example, the answer strings Peter Schmidt and P. Schmidt will be in the same answer cluster. This surface definition for a clustering condition will be replaced by a semantics based definition: if a is more specific than b, cluster a and b with representative a; if b is more specific than a, cluster a and b with representative b; if a and b are unifiable, cluster a and b with the unification of a and b as the representative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Shallow QA Subsystem</head><p>WOCADI produces a partial (and not a complete) semantic network for about 50% of all sentences in the German QA@CLEF corpus. For example, WOCADI can rarely analyze sentences containing grammatical errors, spelling errors, or conflated sentence parts originating from erroneous document preprocessing. Thus, InSicht will not be able to find many of those answers appearing in malformed sentences only. Therefore, we experimented with an additional shallower approach which can be seen as producing an additional answer stream (see <ref type="bibr" coords="6,210.82,523.51,70.56,8.64" target="#b0">(Ahn et al., 2005)</ref> for a QA system with many answer streams).</p><p>We applied a sentence boundary detector and a tokenizer to the corpus and split all documents into single sentences. Then, question-answer pairs for the QA task in previous years were extracted from the MultiEight corpus and augmented manually.</p><p>These pairs were fed into a standard IR system to determine candidate sentences containing an answer. The answer candidates were then processed as follows: Words from closed word categories were annotated with part-of-speech information, keywords in the query were replaced with symbols representing their type (name, upper-case word, lower-case word, number) and the answer string was replaced with an answer variable representing one or more words. We then formed several patterns from this substitution, including a maximum of 5 tokens left and right of the answer variable.</p><p>In this shallow approach, question answering consists of 5 steps: 1. Perform relevance-ranked IR on the corpus and determine the top 250 ranked sentences. 2. Apply pattern matching with the answer patterns extracted. 3. If a match is found, the answer variable contains the string representing the answer. 4. Answer candidates are validated using a simple heuristic: all answers starting with punctuation marks or containing words from a closed word category only are eliminated. 5. Answers are ranked by cumulative frequency and the most frequent answer is chosen. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Run Description and Evaluation</head><p>The current QA system has been evaluated on the German questions from QA@CLEF 2006. The shallow approach found 17 answers in total for the 198 questions assessed for QA@CLEF 2006. 13 of them were also found by the deep approach (run FUHA061dede in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,336.58,316.64,3.60,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref>), but 3 of them were new and correct and 1 was new and inexact (because it omitted a phrase-final acronym). This was our first attempt to combine the deep processing with a shallower method and it leaves many chances for further improvements. However, it already shows that a combination of processing methods will further improve performance for the IRSAW system, a more general retrieval system which will encompass the QA system InSicht. The combination of the deep approach and the shallow approach corresponds to run FUHA062dede in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,443.37,381.80,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.</p><p>The result rows that are preceded by a minus sign (-) in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,351.89,394.83,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref> are from an ablation study: each extension from Sect. 2 was omitted in an evaluation run in order to see the impact on system performance. All extensions had positive effects, but their statistical significance will probably appear only when evaluating on much more questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>The extensions of the QA system InSicht after QA@CLEF 2005 (deixis resolution, increased robustness of coreference resolution, use of negative information during network matching, clustering of answers) improved system results. To investigate the statistical significance of these improvements, the tests should be repeated on much more questions, e.g. the QA@CLEF question sets from <ref type="bibr" coords="7,398.29,531.60,89.11,8.64">2003, 2004, and 2005.</ref> In the future, more deixis resolution rules need to be written, e.g. for resolving names of fixed and floating holidays (during Christmas and 21 days after Easter Sunday), season names (during this Summer), and vague temporal expressions (at the end of this year). Temporal expressions are currently linked to individual sentences. Propagating temporal expressions from a sentence to parts of its cotext (e.g. by event ordering) will increase the amount of available temporal information dramatically.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1" coords="4,164.73,119.13,260.30,147.23"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Description of rules for resolving temporal deixis</figDesc><table coords="4,164.73,133.17,260.30,133.19"><row><cell>Rule</cell><cell>Natural language example</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.weekday.past</cell><cell>the debate on last Monday</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.today</cell><cell>The book is published today.</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.weekday.nonpast</cell><cell>The group will meet on Friday.</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.monthname.past</cell><cell>The law was passed in August.</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.year+opminus</cell><cell>A storm came 2 years ago.</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.tomorrow</cell><cell>The president will arrive tomorrow.</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">deixis.monthname.nonpast The team will win in December.</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.today's</cell><cell>today's news paper</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.year+prop.past</cell><cell>the revenues in the past year</cell></row><row><cell>deixis.yesterday</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
