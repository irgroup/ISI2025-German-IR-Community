<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The paper describes QUANTICO, a cross-language open domain question answering system for German and English. The main features of the system are: use of preemptive off-line document annotation with syntactic information like chunk structures, apposition constructions and abbreviation-extension pairs for the passage retrieval; use of online translation services, language models and alignment methods for the cross-language scenarios; use of redundancy as an indicator of good answer candidates; selection of the best answers based on distance metrics defined over graph representations. Based on the question type two different strategies of answer extraction are triggered: for factoid questions answers are extracted from best IR-matched passages and selected by their redundancy and distance to the question keywords; for definition questions answers are considered to be the most redundant normalized linguistic structures with explanatory role (i.e., appositions, abbreviation's extensions). The results of evaluating the system's performance by CLEF were as follows: for the best German-German run we achieved an overall accuracy (ACC) of 42.33% and a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.45; for the best English-German run 32.98% (ACC) and 0.35 (MRR); for the German-English run 17.89% (ACC) and 0.17 (MRR).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>QUANTICO is a cross-language open domain question answering system developed for both English and German open-domain question answering, cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,271.20,569.57,10.37,8.78" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,288.00,569.57,10.46,8.78" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It uses a common framework for both monolingual and cross-language scenarios, with different workflow settings for each task and different configurations for each type of question. For tasks with different languages on each end of the information flow (question and documents) we cross the language barrier rather on the question than on the document side by using free online translation services, linguistic knowledge and alignment methods. An important aspect of QUANTICO is the triggering of specific answering strategies by means of control information that has been determined by the question analysis tool, e.g., question type and expected answer type, see <ref type="bibr" coords="1,481.80,636.65,11.39,8.78" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for more details. Through the offline annotation of the document collection with several layers of linguistic information (chunks, appositions, named entities, sentence boundaries) and their use in the retrieval process, more accurate and reliable information units are being considered for answer extraction, which is based on the assumption that redundancy is a good indicator of information suitability. The answer selection component normalizes and represents the context of an answer candidate as a graph and computes its appropriateness in terms of the distance between the answer and question keywords.</p><p>We will begin giving a short overview of the system and presenting its working for both factoid and definition questions in monolingual and cross-language scenarios. We will then continue with a short description of each component and close the paper with the presentation of the CLEF evaluation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">System Overview</head><p>QUANTICO uses a common framework for both monolingual and cross-language scenarios, but with different configurations for each type of question (definition or factoid) and different workflow settings for each task (DE2DE, DE2EN or EN2DE).</p><p>Concerning the workflow settings, the following things are to be mentioned. For the monolingual scenario (DE2DE) the workflow is as follows (according to the architecture in the Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,438.12,513.05,3.62,8.78">1</ref>): 1-4-5-6/7 with the last selection depending on the question type. For a cross-language scenario, the workflow depends on the language of the question: for German questions and English documents (DE2EN) the workflow is 1-2-3-4-5-6/7, that is, the question is first analyzed, then translated and aligned to its translations, so that based on the generated QAObj and the alignments a new English QAObj is being computed; for English questions and German documents (EN2DE) the workflow is 2-1-4-5-6/7, that is, the question is first translated and then the best translation -determined according to linguistic completeness -is being analyzed resulting in a QAObj. The difference in the system's workflow for the cross-language scenario comes with our choice of analyzing only German questions, since our analysis component, based on the SMES parser <ref type="bibr" coords="2,464.88,602.57,10.37,8.78" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is very robust and accurate. In the presence of a Question Analysis component with similar properties for English questions, the workflow would be the same (1-2-3-4-5-6/7) independent of the question's language.</p><p>Regarding the component configurations for each type of question (temporal, definition or factoid) the difference is to be noted only in the Passage Retrieval and Answer Extraction components. While the Retrieve process for the factoid questions builds on classic Information Retrieval methods, for definition questions is merely a look-up procedure in a repository of offline extracted syntactic structures as appositions, chunks and abbreviation-extension pairs. For the Answer Extraction component the distinction consists in different methods of computing the clusters of candidate answers: for factoid question, where the candidates are usually named entities or chunks, is based on coreference (John ~ John Doe) and stopword removal (of death ~ death), while for definition questions, where candidates can vary from chunks to whole sentences, is based on topic similarity (Italian designer ~ the designer of a new clothes collection).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Component Description</head><p>Following is a description of QUANTICO's individual components along with some examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Question Analysis</head><p>In context of a QA system or information search in general, we interpret the result of a NL question analysis as a declarative description of search strategy and control information, see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,437.16,226.13,10.46,8.78" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Consider, for example, the NL question result in form of XML for the question "In welcher Stadt fanden 2002 die olympischen Winterspile statt?" (The Olympic winter games took place 2002 in which town?), where the value of tag a-type represents the expected answer type, q-type the answer control strategy, and q-focus and q-scope additional constraints for the search space: &lt;QOBJ msg="quest" id="qId0" lang="de" score="1"&gt; &lt;NL-STRING id="qId0"&gt; &lt;SOURCE id="qId0" lang="de"&gt;In welcher Stadt fanden 2002 die olympischen Winterspiele statt?&lt;/SOURCE&gt; &lt;TARGETS /&gt; &lt;/NL-STRING&gt; &lt;QA-control&gt; &lt;Q-FOCUS&gt;Stadt&lt;/Q-FOCUS&gt; &lt;Q-SCOPE&gt;stattfind_winter#spiel&lt;/Q-SCOPE&gt; &lt;Q-TYPE restriction="TEMP"&gt;C-COMPLETION&lt;/Q-TYPE&gt; &lt;A-TYPE type="atomic"&gt;LOCATION&lt;/A-TYPE&gt; &lt;/QA-control&gt; &lt;KEYWORDS&gt; &lt;KEYWORD id="kw0" type="UNIQUE"&gt; &lt;TK pos="V" stem="statt#find"&gt;fanden&lt;/TK&gt; &lt;/KEYWORD&gt; &lt;KEYWORD id="kw1" type="UNIQUE"&gt; &lt;TK pos="N" stem="stadt"&gt;Stadt&lt;/TK&gt; &lt;/KEYWORD&gt; &lt;KEYWORD id="kw2" type="UNIQUE"&gt; &lt;TK pos="NUMERAL" stem="2002"&gt;2002&lt;/TK&gt; &lt;/KEYWORD&gt; &lt;KEYWORD id="kw3" type="UNIQUE"&gt; &lt;TK pos="A" stem="olympisch"&gt;olympischen&lt;/TK&gt; &lt;/KEYWORD&gt; &lt;KEYWORD id="kw4" type="UNIQUE"&gt; &lt;TK pos="N" stem="winter#spiel"&gt;Winterspiele&lt;/TK&gt; &lt;/KEYWORD&gt; &lt;/KEYWORDS&gt; &lt;EXPANDED-KEYWORDS /&gt; &lt;NE-LIST&gt; &lt;NE id="ne0" type="DATE"&gt;2002&lt;/NE&gt; &lt;/NE-LIST&gt; &lt;/QOBJ&gt; Parts of the information can already be determined on basis of local lexico-syntactic criteria (e.g., for the Wh-phrase where we can simply infer that the expected answer type is location). However, in most cases we have to consider larger syntactic units in combination with information extracted from external knowledge sources. For example for a definition question like "What is a battery?" we have to combine syntactic and type information from the verb and the relevant NP (e.g., combine definite/indefinite NPs together with certain auxiliary verb forms) in order to distinguish it from a description question like "What is the name of the German Chancellor?" In our QAS, we are doing this by following a two-step parsing schema: o in a first step a full syntactic analysis is performed using the robust parser SMES (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.71,693.41,10.43,8.78" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) and o in a second step a question-specific semantic analysis.</p><p>During the second step, the values for the question tags a-type, scope and s-ctr are determined on basis of syntactic constraints applied on the dependency analysis of relevant NP and VP phrases (e.g., considering agreement and functional roles), and by taking into account information from two small knowledge bases. They basically perform a mapping from linguistic entities to values of the questions tags, e.g., trigger phrases like name_of, type_of, abbreviation_of or a mapping from lexical elements to expected answer types, like town, person, and president. For German, we additionally perform a soft retrieval match to the knowledge bases taking into account on-line compound analysis and string-similarity tests. For example, assuming the lexical mapping Stadt → LOCATION for the lexeme town, then automatically we will also map the nominal compounds Hauptstadt (capital) and Großstadt (large city) to LOCATION.</p><p>A main aspect in the adaptation and extension of the question analysis component for the Clef-2006 task concerned the recognition of the question type, i.e., simple factoid and list factoid questions, definition questions and the different types of the temporally restricted questions. Because of its high degree of modularity of the question analysis component, the extension only concerns the semantic analysis subcomponent. Here, additional syntactic-semantic mapping constraints have been implemented that enriched the coverage of the question grammar, where we used the question set of the previous Clef campaigns as our development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Translation Services and Alignment</head><p>We are using two different methods for responding questions asked in a language different from the one of the answer-bearing documents. Both employ online translation services (Altavista, FreeTranslation, etc.) for crossing the language barrier, but at different processing steps: before and after formalizing the user information need into a QAObj.</p><p>The a priori-method translates the question string in an earlier step, resulting in several automatic translated strings, of which the best one is analyzed by the Question Analysis component and passed on to the Passage Retrieval component. This is the strategy we use in an English-German cross-lingual setting. To be more precise: the English source question is translated into several alternative German questions using online MT services. Each German question is then parsed with SMES, our German parser. The resulting query object is then weighted according to its linguistic well-formedness and its completeness with respect to the query information (question type, question focus, answer-type).</p><p>The assumption behind this weighting scheme is that "a translated string is of greater utility for subsequent processes than another one, if its linguistic analysis is more complete or appropriate."</p><p>The a posteriori-method translates the formalized result of the Query Analysis component by using the question translations, a language modeling tool and a word alignment tool for creating a mapping of the formal information need from the source language into the target language. We illustrate this strategy in a German-English setting along two lines (using the following German question as example: "In welchem Jahrzehnt investierten japanische Autohersteller sehr stark?"):</p><p>• translations as returned by the on-line MT systems are being ranked according to a language model o In which decade did Japanese automakers invest very strongly? (0.7) o In which decade did Japanese car manufacturers invest very strongly? (0.8)</p><p>• translations with a satisfactory degree of resemblance to a natural language utterance (i.e. linguistically well-formedness), given by a threshold on the language model ranking, are aligned based on several filters: dictionary filter -based on MRD (machine readable dictionaries), PoS filter -based on statistical part-of-speech taggers, and cognates filter -based on string similarity measures (dice coefficient and LCSR (lowest common substring ratio)).</p><p>In </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Passage Retrieval</head><p>The preemptive offline document annotation refers to the process of annotating the document collections with information that might be valuable during the retrieval process by increasing the accuracy of the hit list. Since for factoid questions the expected answer type is usually a named entity type, annotating the documents with named entities provides for an additional indexation unit that might help to scale down the range of retrieved passages to those only containing the searched answer type. The same practice applies for definition questions given the known fact that some structural linguistic patterns (appositions, abbreviation-extension pairs) are used with explanatory and descriptive purpose. Extracting these kind of patterns in advance and looking up the definition term among them might return more accurate results than those of a search engine.</p><p>The Generate Query process mediates between the question analysis result QAObj (answer type, focus, keywords) and the search engine (factoid questions) or the repository of syntactic structures (definition questions) serving the retrieval component with information units (passages). The Generate Query process builds on an abstract description of the processing method for every type of question to accordingly generate the IRQuery to make use of the advanced indexation units. For example given the question "What is the capital of Germany?", since named entities were annotated during the offline annotation and used as indexing units, the Query Generator adapts the IRQuery so as to restrict the search only to those passages having at least two locations: one as the possible answer (Berlin) and the other as the question's keyword (Germany).</p><p>It is often the case that the question has a semantic similarity with the passages containing the answer, but no lexical overlap. For example, for a question like "Who is the French prime-minister?", passages containing "prime-minister X of France", "prime-minister X … the Frenchman" and "the French leader of the government" might be relevant for extracting the right answer. The Extend process accounts for bridging this gap at the lexical level, either through look-up of unambiguous resources or as a side-effect of the translation and alignment process (see <ref type="bibr" coords="5,253.08,407.45,10.31,8.78" target="#b3">[4]</ref>).</p><p>Whereas the Retrieve process for definition questions is straightforward for cases when the offline annotation repository lookup was successful, in other cases it implies an online search of the document collection and retrieval of only those passages that might bear a resemblance to a definition. The selection of these passages is attained by matching them against a lexico-syntactic pattern of the form: &lt;Searched Concept&gt; &lt;definition verb&gt; .+ whereby &lt;definition verb&gt; is being defined as a closed list of verbs like "is", "means", "signify", "stand for" and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Answer Extraction</head><p>The Answer Extraction component is based on the assumption that the redundancy of information is a good indicator for its suitability. The different configurations of this component for factoid and definition questions reflect the distinction of the answers being extracted for these two question types: simple chunks (i.e., named entities and basic noun phrases) and complex structures (from phrases through sentences) and their normalization. For factoid questions having named entities as expected answer type the Group (normalization) process consists in resolving cases of coreference, while for definition questions with phrases and sentences as possible answers more advanced methods are being involved. The current procedure for clustering definitions consists in finding out the focus of the explanatory sentence or the head of the considered phrase. Each cluster gets a weight assigned based solely on its size (definition questions) or using additional information like the average of the IR-scores and the document distribution for each of its members (factoid questions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Answer Selection</head><p>Using the most representative sample (centroid) of the answer candidates' clusters, the Answer Selection component sorts out a list of top answers based on a distance metric defined over graph representations of the answer's context. The context is first normalized by removing all functional words and then represented as a graph structure. The score of an answer is defined in terms of its distance to the question concepts occurring in its context and the distance among these.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation Results</head><p>We participated in three tasks: DE2DE, EN2DE and DE2EN, where the summary of the results can be found in the table below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task</head><p>Overall For the tasks DE2DE and EN2DE we submitted two runs, for DE2EN only one. Compared to the results from last year, we were able to keep our performance for the monolingual German task (2005: 43.50%).</p><p>For the task English to German we were able to improve our result (2005: 25.50%). But for the task German to English we observed a decrease (2005: 23.50%). Furthermore, although the question analysis component was able to identify the different types of temporal questions, in no cases we were able to correctly identify and extract answers for those questions. It is still unclear, why.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,165.27,651.46,51.49,8.65;4,157.68,662.62,100.60,8.65;4,157.68,673.78,109.24,8.65;4,157.68,684.94,111.52,8.65;4,157.68,696.22,121.60,8.65;4,157.68,707.38,239.33,8.65;4,157.68,718.66,76.84,8.65;5,157.68,107.86,94.72,8.65"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>: [in:1.0] 1.0 welchem: [which:0.5] 0.5 Jahrzehnt: [decade:1.0] 1.0 investierten: [invest:1.0] 1.0 japanische: [Japanese:0.5] 0.5 Autohersteller: [car manufacturers:0.8, auto makers:0.1] 0.8 sehr: [very:1.0] 1.0 stark: [strongly:0.5] 0.5</figDesc></figure>
