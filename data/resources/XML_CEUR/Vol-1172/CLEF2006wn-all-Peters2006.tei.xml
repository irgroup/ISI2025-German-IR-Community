<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of CLEF is to promote research in the field of multilingual system development. This is done through the organisation of annual evaluation campaigns in which a series of tracks designed to test different aspects of mono-and cross-language information retrieval (IR) are offered. The intention is to encourage experimentation with all kinds of multilingual information access -from the development of systems for monolingual retrieval operating on many languages to the implementation of complete multilingual multimedia search services. This has been achieved by offering an increasingly complex and varied set of evaluation tasks over the years. The aim is not only to meet but also to anticipate the emerging needs of the R&amp;D community and to encourage the development of next generation multilingual IR systems. These Working Notes contain descriptions of the experiments conducted within CLEF 2006 -the sixth in a series of annual system evaluation campaigns 1 . The results of the experiments will be presented and discussed in the CLEF 2006 Workshop, 20-22 September, Alicante, Spain. The final papers -revised and extended as a result of the discussions at the Workshop -together with a comparative analysis of the results will appear in the CLEF 2006 Proceedings, to be published by Springer in their Lecture Notes for Computer Science series. As from CLEF 2005, the Working Notes are published in electronic format only and are distributed to participants at the Workshop on CD-ROM together with the Book of Abstracts in printed form. All reports included in the Working Notes will also be inserted in the DELOS Digital Library, accessible at http://delos-dl.isti.cnr.it. Both Working Notes and Book of Abstracts are divided into eight sections, corresponding to the CLEF 2006 evaluation tracks. In addition appendices are included containing run statistics for the Ad Hoc, Domain-Specific, GeoCLEF and QA tracks, plus a list of all participating groups showing in which track they took part. The main features of the 2006 campaign are briefly outlined here below in order to provide the necessary background to the experiments reported in the rest of the Working Notes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Tracks and Tasks in CLEF 2006</head><p>CLEF 2006 offered eight tracks designed to evaluate the performance of systems for:</p><p>• mono-, bi-and multilingual textual document retrieval on news collections (Ad Hoc)</p><p>• mono-and cross-language information on structured scientific data (Domain-Specific) • interactive cross-language retrieval (iCLEF) • multiple language question answering (QA@CLEF) • cross-language retrieval in image collections (ImageCLEF) • cross-language spoken document retrieval (CL-SR)</p><p>• multilingual retrieval of Web documents (WebCLEF) • cross-language geographical retrieval (GeoCLEF) Although these tracks are the same as those offered in CLEF 2005, many of the tasks offered are new. Multilingual Text Retrieval (Ad Hoc): Similarly to last year, the 2006 track offered mono-and bilingual tasks on target collections in French, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Hungarian. The topics (i.e. statements of information needs from which queries are derived) were prepared in a wide range of European languages (Bulgarian, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish). We also offered a bilingual task aimed at encouraging system testing with non-European languages against an English target collection. Topics were supplied in: Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Oromo and Telugu. This choice of languages was determined by the demand from participants. In addition, a new "robust" task was offered; this task emphasized the importance of stable performance over languages instead of high average performance in mono-, bilingual and multilingual IR. It made use of test collections previously developed at CLEF. The track is coordinated jointly by ISTI-CNR and U.Padua (Italy) and U.Hildesheim (Germany).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Scientific Data Retrieval (Domain-Specific):</head><p>This track studied retrieval in a domain-specific context using the GIRT-4 German/English social science database and two Russian corpora: Russian Social Science Corpus (RSSC) and the ISISS collection of sociology and economics documents. Multilingual controlled vocabularies (German-English, English-German, German-Russian, English-Russian) were available. Monolingual and cross-language tasks were offered. Topics were prepared in English, German and Russian. Participants could make use of the indexing terms inside the documents and/or the Social Science Thesaurus provided, not only as translation means, but also for tuning relevance decisions of their system. The track is coordinated by IZ Bonn (Germany). Interactive CLIR (iCLEF): For CLEF 2006, the interactive track joined forces with the image track to work on a new type of interactive image retrieval task to better capture the interplay between image and the multilingual reality of the internet for the public at large. The task was based on the popular image perusal community Flickr (www.flickr.com), a dynamic and rapidly changing database of images with textual comments, captions, and titles in many languages and annotated by image creators and viewers cooperatively in a self-organizing ontology of tags (a so-called "folksonomy"). The track is coordinated by UNED (Spain), U. Sheffield (UK) and SICS (Sweden). Multilingual Question Answering (QA@CLEF): This track, which has received increasing interest at CLEF since 2003, evaluated both monolingual (non-English) and cross-language QA systems. The main task evaluated open domain QA systems. Target collections were offered in Bulgarian, Dutch, English (bilingual only), French, German, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish. In addition, three pilot tasks were organized: a task that assessed question answering using Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia; an Answer Validation exercise; and a "Time-constrained" exercise to be conducted during the workshop. A number of institutions (one for each language) collaborated in the organization of the main task; the Wikipedia activity was coordinated by U. Amsterdam (The Netherlands), the Answer Validation exercise by UNED (Spain) and the Time-constrained exercise by U. Alicante (Spain). The overall coordination of this track is by ITC-irst and CELCT, Trento (Italy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Retrieval in Image Collections (ImageCLEF):</head><p>This track evaluated retrieval of images described by text captions based on queries in a different language; both text and image matching techniques were potentially exploitable. Two main sub-tracks were organised for photographic and medical image retrieval. Each track offered two tasks: bilingual ad hoc retrieval (collection in English, queries in a range of languages) and an annotation task in the first case; medical image retrieval (collection with casenotes in English, French and German, queries derived from short text plus image -visual, mixed and semantic queries) and automatic annotation for medical images (fully categorized collection, categories available in English and German) in the second. The tasks offered different and challenging retrieval problems for cross-language image retrieval. Image analysis was not required for all tasks and a default visual image retrieval system was made available for participants as well as results from a basic text retrieval system. The track coordinators are University of Sheffield (UK) and the University and Hospitals of Geneva (Switzerland). Oregon Health and Science University (USA), Victoria University, Melbourne (Australia), RWTH Aachen University (Germany), and Vienna University of Technology (Austria) collaborate in the task organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR):</head><p>In 2005, the CL-SR track built a reusable test collection for searching spontaneous conversational English speech using queries in five languages (Czech, English, French, German and Spanish), speech recognition for spoken words, manually and automatically assigned controlled vocabulary descriptors for concepts, dates and locations, manually assigned person names, and hand-written segment summaries. The 2006 CL-SR track included a second test collection containing about 500 hours of Czech speech. Multilingual topic sets were again created for five languages. The track was coordinated by the University of Maryland (USA) and Dublin City University (Ireland).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multilingual Web Retrieval (WebCLEF):</head><p>WebCLEF 2006 used the EuroGOV collection, with web pages crawled from European governmental sites for over 20 languages/countries. It was decided to focus this year on the mixed-monolingual known-item topics. The topics were a mixture of old topics and new topics. The old topics were a subset of last year's topics; the new topics were provided by the organizers, using a new method for generating known-item test beds and some human generated new topics. The experiments explored two complementary dimensions: old vs new topics; topics generated by participants vs automatically topics generated by the organizers Cross-Language Geographical Retrieval (GeoCLEF): The track provided a framework in which to evaluate GIR systems for search tasks involving both spatial and multilingual aspects. Participants were offered a TREC style ad hoc retrieval task based on existing CLEF collections. The aim was to compare methods of query translation, query expansion, translation of geographical references, use of text and spatial retrieval methods separately or combined, retrieval models and indexing methods. Given a multilingual statement describing a spatial user need (topic), the challenge was to find relevant documents from target collections in English and Portuguese German and/or Spanish news documents. Monolingual and cross-language tasks were activated. 25 topics were prepared in the target languages and in Japanese. Spatial analysis was not required to participate in this task but could be used to augment text-retrieval methods. A number of groups collaborated in the organization of the track; the overall coordination was by UC Berkley (USA) and U. Sheffield (UK).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Test Collections</head><p>The CLEF test collections, created as a result of the evaluation campaigns, consist of topics or queries, documents, and relevance assessments. Each track was responsible for preparing its own topic/query statements and for performing relevance assessments of the results submitted by participating groups. A number of different document collections were used in CLEF 2006 to build the test collections:</p><p>• CLEF multilingual comparable corpus of more than 2 million news docs in 12 languages (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,510.77,193.74,4.17,9.02" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) ; this corpus was unchanged from 2005. Parts of this collection were used in three tracks: Ad-Hoc (all languages except Finnish, Swedish and Russian), Question Answering (all languages except Finnish, Hungarian, Swedish and Russian) and GeoCLEF (English, German, Portuguese and Spanish).</p><p>• The CLEF domain-specific collection consisting of the GIRT-4 social science database in English and German (over 300,000 documents) and two Russian databases: the Russian Social Science Corpus (approx. 95,000 documents) and the Russian ISISS collection for sociology and economics (approx. 150,000 docs). The ISISS corpus was new this year. Controlled vocabularies in German-English and German-Russian were also made available to the participants in this track. This collection was used in the domain-specific track.</p><p>• The ImageCLEF track used four collections:</p><p>the ImageCLEFmed radiological medical database based on a dataset containing images from the Casimage, MIR, PEIR, and PathoPIC datasets (about 50,000 images) with case notes in English (majority) but also German and French.</p><p>the IRMA collection in English and German of 10,000 images for automatic medical image annotation the IAPR TC-12 database of 25,000 photographs with captions in English, German and Spanish a general photographic collection for image annotation provide by LookThatUp (LTUtech) database</p><p>• The Speech retrieval track used the Malach collection of spontaneous conversational speech derived from the Shoah archives in English (more than 750 hours) and Czech (approx 500 hours)</p><p>• The WebCLEF track used a collection crawled from European governmental sites, called EuroGOV. This collection consists of more than 3.35 million pages from 27 primary domains. The most frequent languages are Finnish (20%), German (18%), Hungarian (13%), English (10%), and Latvian (9%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Technical Infrastructure</head><p>The CLEF technical infrastructure is managed by the DIRECT system. DIRECT manages the test data plus results submission and analyses for the ad hoc, question answering and geographic IR tracks. It has been designed to facilitate data management tasks but also to support the production, maintenance, enrichment and interpretation of the scientific data for subsequent in-depth evaluation studies.</p><p>The technical infrastructure is thus responsible for:</p><p>• the track set-up, harvesting of documents, management of the registration of participants to tracks;</p><p>• the submission of experiments, collection of metadata about experiments, and their validation;</p><p>• the creation of document pools and the management of relevance assessment;</p><p>• the provision of common statistical analysis tools for both organizers and participants in order to allow the comparison of the experiments; • the provision of common tools for summarizing, producing reports and graphs on the measured performances and conducted analyses. DIRECT was designed and implemented by Giorgio Di Nunzio and Nicola Ferro and is described in more detail in a paper in these Working Notes.   <ref type="formula" coords="5,126.48,606.54,8.54,9.02">19</ref>) from N.America; 10(10) from Asia, 4(1) from S.America and 2(1) from Australia<ref type="foot" coords="5,472.50,604.45,3.24,5.83" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Last years' figures are given between brackets. The breakdown of participation of groups per track is as follows: Ad Hoc 25; Domain-Specific 4; iCLEF 3; QAatCLEF 37; ImageCLEF 25; CL-SR 6; WebCLEF 8; GeoCLEF 17. As in previous years, participating groups consisted of a nice mix of new-comers (34) and groups that had participated in one or more previous editions (56). Most of the groups came from academia; there were just 9 research groups from industry. A list of groups and indications of the tracks in which they participated is given in Appendix to these Working Notes.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,99.93,686.88,5.01,9.02">1</ref> shows the growth in participation this year and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,329.96,686.88,5.01,9.02">2</ref> shows the shift in focus over the years as new tracks have been added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Workshop</head><p>CLEF aims at creating a strong CLIR/MLIR research and development community. The Workshop plays an important role by providing the opportunity for all the groups that have participated in the evaluation campaign to get together comparing approaches and exchanging ideas. The work of the groups participating in this year's campaign will be presented in plenary and parallel paper sessions and an afternoon poster session. There will also be break-out sessions for more in-depth discussion of the results of individual tracks and intentions for the future.</p><p>The final sessions will include discussions on ideas for new tracks in future campaigns. Overall, the Workshop should provide an ample panorama of the current state-of-the-art and the latest research directions in the multilingual information retrieval area. I very much hope that it will prove an interesting, worthwhile and enjoyable experience to all those who participate.</p><p>The final programme and the presentations at the Workshop will be posted on the CLEF website at http://www.clef-campaign.org.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,181.98,300.36,231.51,9.02"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div><head>Acknowledgements</head><p>I could not run the CLEF evaluation initiative and organize the annual workshops without considerable assistance from many people. CLEF is organized on a distributed basis, with different research groups being responsible for the running of the various tracks.
