Because of its wide applicability, mainly in security aspects, the development of automated AA techniques has received much attention recently <ref type="bibr" coords="1,206.70,532.19,16.00,8.64" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,222.70,532.19,12.00,8.64" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,234.70,532.19,12.00,8.64" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>AA is defined as the task of identifying whom, from a set of candidates, is the author of a given document <ref type="bibr" coords="1,221.00,556.10,15.27,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

One of the most popular formulations for AA and AV is that based in supervised machine learning methods, where both problems are faced as classification tasks. More specifically, AA can be faced as one of multiclass classification, with as many labels as candidate authors <ref type="bibr" coords="2,282.40,119.31,15.77,8.64" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,298.17,119.31,11.83,8.64" target="#b12">13]</ref>.

We adopted classification-based methods for facing both AA and AV tasks. For AA we used standard classification algorithms with a distributional term representation for documents.

We used sample documents by the author as positive examples and documents written by other authors as negative examples. In order to obtain stable predictions we adopted a meta-ensemble approach that combines the outputs of several runs of the model selection technique.

An exception is the work by Escalante et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,195.65,555.19,10.58,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, where particle swarm model selection (PSMS) was used for building specific classification models for each author. The hypothesis of that work is that by considering specific methods for preprocessing, feature selection and classification for each author will increase the classification performance. Satisfactory performance was obtained in the task of AV (i.e., binary classification), although AA performance (i.e., multiclass classification) was limited (because of the incompatibility of scales for the outputs of different models, see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,266.14,626.92,10.45,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). Since PSMS has proved to be very effective for diverse binary classification tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.40,119.31,11.38,8.64" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,283.78,119.31,7.59,8.64" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,291.37,119.31,7.59,8.64" target="#b8">9]</ref> in this paper we adopt a modified PSMS for the AV task and we used standard learning algorithms for the AA task in the PAN'11 Authorship Identification track.</p><p>While standard learning algorithms have been used for AA and AV, a wide diversity of features have been used for representing documents, including, character, lexical, syntactical, grammatical and semantic, among others <ref type="bibr" coords="3,345.47,179.24,16.00,8.64" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,361.47,179.24,12.00,8.64" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.47,179.24,12.00,8.64" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Nevertheless, the most used representation is still the one based on the bag-of-words formulation. In particular, the bag-of-words formulation using character n-grams has terms have been successfully used by several researchers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,249.81,215.11,11.88,8.64" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,261.69,215.11,11.88,8.64" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,273.57,215.11,11.88,8.64" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,285.44,215.11,11.88,8.64" target="#b21">22]</ref>. In this paper we adopted an extended bagof-words representation for documents called the document occurrence representation (DOR) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,165.69,239.02,15.27,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Under DOR documents are represented by a distribution of occurrences over other documents in the corpus, in such a way that documents are represented by their context. DOR has been successfully used in term clustering <ref type="bibr" coords="3,396.64,262.93,15.27,8.64" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, word sense disambiguation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,187.07,274.89,16.60,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and multimedia image retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="3,332.94,274.89,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Authorship verification</head><p>Three AV tasks we evaluated in the PAN'11 authorship identification track. For each task organizers provide sample documents written by the author (training set) and documents written by the author and other authors (validation set). The developed method was tested in documents from the test set (of course, labels in the test set were not available to participants during the competition). Since both, training and validation data are available during development we merged the documents in the training and validation sets for training our method. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,277.72,403.97,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the number of documents written and not written by the author of each data set in the training, validation and test sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Features</head><p>In our approach to AV we used documents in the training and validation sets as training data for training a classifier that discriminates between documents written by the author and documents written by any other author. Documents were represented by their bagof-words using character n-grams as terms, with n = 3. Spaces and punctuation marks were considered characters. We did not use the distributional term representation for this task because of the small number of documents in the training and validation sets, see Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Classification approach</head><p>Once that documents are represented by their bag-of-words we used Ensemble Particle Swarm Model Selection (EPSMS) for the selection of classification models for each data set. EPSMS is a method for the automatic selection of binary classification models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,166.78,218.17,10.58,8.64" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In a nutshell, EPSMS searches for the best ensemble method that can be generated by using the methods available in a machine learning toolbox <ref type="foot" coords="4,419.88,228.45,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_3">3</ref> . An ensemble is a classification model that combines the outputs of several classifiers. Under certain conditions, it has been shown that ensembles can achieve better performance than individual models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,210.42,265.99,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In previous work we have shown that EPSMS can select very effective ensemble classification models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,299.84,277.94,10.79,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,310.62,277.94,7.19,8.64" target="#b3">4]</ref>. A distinctive feature of EPSMS is that each of the members of the ensemble is a method that differs in terms of preprocessing method, feature selection technique and learning algorithm. The heterogeneity of the considered models (diversity) together with the competitive accuracy (performance) of models guarantee selecting very effective classification models. See <ref type="bibr" coords="4,409.67,325.76,11.38,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,421.06,325.76,7.59,8.64" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,428.64,325.76,7.59,8.64" target="#b4">5]</ref> for further details on EPSMS.</p><p>For each AV data set we provide as input to EPSMS the training+validation data and EPSMS returns a ensemble classifier. Although EPSMS provides very stable classification models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,193.36,373.71,11.45,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,204.81,373.71,7.64,8.64" target="#b3">4]</ref> in this work we wanted to obtain even more stable models. Therefore, we adopted a meta-ensemble approach in which the outputs of several ensembles (each one selected with EPSMS) were combined. The intuition behind this technique is that by running EPSMS several times and combining the outputs of the corresponding methods we could more stable predictions. Stability is very important in EPSMS as this method is based in a heuristic search method, besides the search space contains many local minima.</p><p>The meta-ensemble approach is as follows. For each AV data set we ran EPSMS 5 times. Then the selected ensembles were applied to the test data set. As a result we have for each test document the five outputs provided by the 5 ensembles. The output of each ensemble is a real number between [0, 1] expressing the confidence that the sample belongs to the positive class. The outputs of each ensemble are sorted in descending order in such a way that test documents that are more likely to belong to the positive class (i.e., documents written by the author) are ranked in the first positions. For each ranking we keep the top-10 ranked documents. Then, for each document in the union of the 50 documents we count the number of rankings in which they appeared within the top-10 positions(a number between 1 and 5). Finally, we sort the test documents by this number and assign the positive label to the top 10 ranked documents.</p><p>Our hypothesis with this method is that if the document is likely to be written by the author it is very likely that the document will receive a high score from several EPSMS ensembles. Documents not written by the author of interest may appear in the top ranked documents for one or two ensembles, although it is reasonable to assume that the top ranked documents are those with more chances to be written by the author.</p><p>The choice of the top 10 ranked documents was done by analyzing the outputs of the different ensembles. We found that after 10 documents most of the documents received very similar scores in the test set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Authorship attribution</head><p>As mentioned in the related work section, the performance of PSMS <ref type="bibr" coords="5,403.13,195.85,11.62,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and EPSMS <ref type="bibr" coords="5,466.37,195.85,11.45,8.64" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,477.82,195.85,7.64,8.64" target="#b3">4]</ref> for multiclass classification models is not as good as for binary classification tasks. Therefore, we decided to adopt a different approach for the AA task. In particular, we focused on the evaluation of an extended bag-of-words representation for documents and used a standard classification model.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Features</head><p>The bag-of-words representation using character n-grams as terms is among the most used representations for documents in AA <ref type="bibr" coords="5,306.30,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.36,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,330.42,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,342.48,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,354.54,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,366.60,477.11,12.06,8.64" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Despite the fact that acceptable performance has been obtained with such representation in AA, we think that results obtained with such representation can be improved by adopting extended representations. Several extensions to the bag-of-words approach has been proposed in closely related fields as information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="5,322.41,524.93,10.58,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, computational linguistics <ref type="bibr" coords="5,445.83,524.93,16.60,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and machine learning <ref type="bibr" coords="5,207.14,536.89,15.27,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this work we explore the suitability of the document occurrence representation (DOR) for document representation in AA. DOR is a distributional term representation in which a document is represented by a distribution of occurrences over other documents in the same corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="5,409.16,572.75,15.27,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Intuitively, a document is represented by its context. The process for obtaining the DOR representation for documents is as follows. First, each term in the vocabulary is first represented as a distribution of occurrences over documents. Next, each document is then represented by a combination of the representations of terms that occur in the document.</p><p>DOR is considered the dual of the tf-idf representation for representing documents: as documents can be represented by a distribution over the terms, terms can be represented by a distribution over documents. Each term t j in the vocabulary V is represented by a vector of weights w dor j =&lt; w dor j,1 , . . . , w dor j,N &gt;, where N is the number of documents in the collection and 0 ≤ w dor j,k ≤ 1 represents the contribution of document d k to the representation of t j . Specifically, we consider the following weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="6,461.22,144.82,15.49,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="6,230.15,167.25,250.44,23.22">w dor (t j , d k ) = df (t j , d k ) × log |V | N k (1)</formula><p>where N k is the number of different terms that appear in document d k and df (t j , d k ) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="6,200.06,227.92,280.53,20.98">df (t j , d k ) = 1 + log #(t j , d k ) if #(t j , d k ) &gt; 0 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>where #(t j , d k ) denotes the number of times term t j occurs in document d k . The weights are normalized using cosine normalization. Intuitively, the more frequent the term t j occurs in document d k , the more important d k is to characterize the semantics of t j ; on the other hand, the more different terms occur in d k , the less it contributes to characterize the semantics of t j .</p><p>Once that each term is represented according to Formula (1) each document is represented by the unweighed sum of the representations of terms that appear in the document. In this way, a document is represented as a distribution of occurrences over other documents in the collection. Our hypothesis on the use of DOR for AA is that the expanded representations are more descriptive than the usual bag-of-words approach. We did not use this representation for the AV task because the number of documents in the different tasks are very small (see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,310.19,392.73,3.60,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which resulted in very low dimensional representations of documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Classification approach</head><p>For classification we used the neural network classifier implemented in the CLOP toolbox <ref type="bibr" coords="6,151.85,473.77,15.27,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. We selected this classifier after performing a preliminary evaluation of several classification algorithms. We found that the combination of DOR representation and neural network classifier achieved the highest performance in the validation data sets. For the standard data sets, see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,289.19,509.64,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, we used a straight multiclass classifier (onevs-all approach), where a class corresponds to an author. For the plus data sets (i.e., data sets that contain documents not written by any author in the training set). We used a multiclass classifier with an extra class: unknown author. We just considered documents not written by any author in the training set as another author. Recall, we used training+validation data for training the classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>This section reports the results obtained with the proposed methods in the authorship attribution track of PAN'11. We first analyze the performance of the AV methods and then that of the AA techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Authorship verification</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,160.68,137.65,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the results obtained in the AV data sets. The results are mixed: our EPSMS approach obtained the first position in the second data set, although it was ranked ninth in the third data set. For the data set Verify-1, a single document written by the author (out of three available) was identified, this document was ranked second according to the weights generated with the meta-ensemble approach. The other two relevant documents did not appear in the top ranked documents for any of the 5 ensembles. For the Verify-2 data set 4 out of 5 documents were identified by the EPSMS approach, while no author was correctly identified for the Verify-3 data set 3. From Table <ref type="table" coords="7,199.01,352.50,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we can see that the problems are imbalanced and the fact that negative examples (documents written by other authors) are made of documents from different authors further complicated the classification problem. Nevertheless, the results obtained with the proposed formulation are interesting and give evidence that the classification approach to AV can be very effective. We believe the proposed method has potential for this and other binary classification tasks, although we would like to conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach in order to detect what factors influence the performance of the proposed technique. A limitation of the proposed approach is that it ranks documents that are more likely to be written by the author, and then a threshold (top 10-ranked documents) must be used for determining what documents were written by the author. In future work we would like to study alternative formulations for the combination of the outputs from different ensembles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Authorship attribution</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,159.33,530.65,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows the official results obtained by our methods in the AA task. Overall, we can say that results were very competitive. Our entries were above the average performance among other participants. The results were particularly positive in the Small data sets where our method is ranked second and third. Interestingly, the DOR representation resulted more helpful for the data sets that included authors not seen in the training set. Giving evidence that a classification approach for modeling unknown authors can be an effective solution for this AA scenario. The performance in terms of macro and micro average measures was proportional.</p><p>In order to evaluate the advantage of the DOR representation over a standard bag-ofwords formulation we performed post-competition experiments <ref type="foot" coords="7,387.27,636.58,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_4">4</ref> . We performed exper- iments using the same classification-based approach described in Section 4, although using a binary bag-of-words representation with character n-grams as terms. The same neural network with the same (default) parameters as used with the DOR representation. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,159.14,291.48,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_5">5</ref> shows the performance obtained by the classifier with both representations. Results are mixed: for the Small data sets the DOR representation outperformed the performance of the bag-of-words formulation. While the improvement in terms of accuracy is considerable the ranking of both methods was not significantly affected. On the contrary, in the Large data sets the bag-of-words approach outperformed the DOR representation. The differences in all of the measures are considerable (more than 10% in accuracy). Note that the ranking for the Large data sets are considerably reduced for the bag-of-words approach. This result was somewhat unexpected, as one may think that since in the Large data sets we have more documents available, the DOR representations can be more informative (richer). We think that this results are due to the fact that having more classes there can be an overlap in the representations for documents that belong to different classes. We will try to clarify this behavior in future work. Another issue could be that the number of documents over which compute the DOR representation (and even the selection of which documents are used) can have an important impact into the performance of methods based on this representation.</p><p>We described the methods adopted for the PAN'11 Authorship Identification track. Different methods were proposed for the attribution (AA) and verification (AV) tasks. For AV we used EPSMS a tool for the automated selection of ensemble classifiers. Our results show that EPSMS is a very competitive method although it still can further improved. In particular we would like to study different ways to determine that a document has/hasnot been written by an author from the outputs of several ensembles selected with EPSMS. For AA we adopted the document occurrence representation and used a standard classifier. We found that in the Small data sets the DOR representation resulted very helpful, although it was not the case for the Large data sets. It is interesting, and somehow disappointing, that a simple bag-of-words representation outperformed the DOR-based approach in the Large data sets. We would like to analyze in more detail the benefits of DOR for AA and what factors affect the performance of methods based on that representation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,134.77,447.55,345.83,83.63"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Number of documents written (Y) and not written by the author (N) in the training, validation and test sets.</figDesc><table coords="3,211.04,477.63,184.31,53.55"><row><cell>Data set</cell><cell>Training</cell><cell cols="2">Validation</cell><cell></cell><cell>Test</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Y</cell><cell>Y</cell><cell>N</cell><cell>Y</cell><cell>N</cell></row><row><cell>Verify-1+</cell><cell>42</cell><cell>3</cell><cell cols="2">104 3</cell><cell>92</cell></row><row><cell>Verify-2+</cell><cell>55</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>95</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>101</cell></row><row><cell>Verify-3+</cell><cell>47</cell><cell>3</cell><cell cols="2">100 4</cell><cell>89</cell></row></table></figure>
