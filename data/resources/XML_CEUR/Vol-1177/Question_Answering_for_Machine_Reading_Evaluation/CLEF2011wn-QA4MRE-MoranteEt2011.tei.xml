<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Until recently, research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has focused on propositional aspects of meaning. For example, semantic role labeling, question answering or text mining tasks aim at extracting information of the type "who does what when and where". However, understanding language involves also processing extra-propositional aspects of meaning, such as factuality, uncertainty, or subjectivity, since the same propositional meaning can be presented in a diversity of statements, as exemplified in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,314.45,424.29,11.62,8.74" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, where the propositional meaning &lt;ADD(earthquake, further threats to the global economy)&gt; is present in multiple statements, none of which has the same meaning.</p><p>(1) The earthquake adds further threats to the global economy The earthquake does not add further threats to the global economy The earthquake never added further threats to the global economy Does the earthquake add further threats to the global economy? The earthquake will never add further threats to the global economy The earthquake will probably add further threats to the global economy The earthquake will certainly add further threats to the global economy The earthquake might have added further threats to the global economy According to some media sources, the earthquake adds further threats to the global economy The earthquake will add further threats to the global economy if the right measures are not applied It is unclear whether the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy It is expected that the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy It has been denied that the earthquake adds further threats to the global economy It is believed that the earthquake adds further threats to the global economy Why would the earthquake not add further threats to the global economy?</p><p>Researchers have started to study phenomena related to extra-propositional meaning such as factuality, belief and certainty, speculative language and hedging, or contradictions and opinions. Modality and negation are two main grammatical devices that allow to express extra-propositional aspects of meaning. Generally speaking, modality is a grammatical category that allows to express aspects related to the attitude of the speaker towards her statements in terms of degree of certainty, reliability, subjectivity, sources of information, and perspective. We understand modality in a broad sense, which involves related concepts like subjectivity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,203.79,214.64,16.38,8.74" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, hedging <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.57,214.64,16.38,8.74" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, evidentiality (1), uncertainty <ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.70,214.64,16.38,8.74" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, committed belief (6) and factuality <ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.04,226.59,16.38,8.74" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Negation (36) is a grammatical category that allows to change the truth value of a proposition.</p><p>Research on modality and negation has been stimulated by a number of data sets annotated with various aspects of modality and negation information, such as the Rubin's certainty corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,270.07,274.41,31.53,8.74">(29; 30)</ref>, the ACE 2008 corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.35,274.41,16.38,8.74" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, the BioScope corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.39,286.37,16.38,8.74" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, and the FactBank corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="2,303.47,286.37,16.38,8.74" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</p><p>Two main tasks have been addressed in the NLP community, the detection of various forms of negation and modality and the resolution of the scope of modality and negation cues. For negation detection, a number of rule-based systems have been developed (2; 23; 4), as well as some systems that rely on machine learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.86,346.14,79.03,8.74">(3; 11; 12; 28; 40)</ref>. Negation has also been incorporated explicitly or implicitly in systems that process contradiction and contrast <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.18,358.10,47.78,8.74">(13; 27; 16)</ref>. There are several systems for modality detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.50,370.05,96.74,8.74">(20; 15; 19; 35; 10; 24)</ref>. The recently introduced scope resolution task is concerned with determining at a sentence level which tokens are affected by negation and modality <ref type="bibr" coords="2,388.17,393.96,65.26,8.74">(22; 21; 25; 24)</ref>. This task has become very popular after the edition of the CoNLL Shared Task 2010 on Learning to detect hedges and their scope in natural language texts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,441.45,417.87,11.62,8.74" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>Incorporating information about modality and negation has been shown to be useful for a number of applications, such as biomedical and clinical text processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.01,453.74,73.15,8.74">(9; 18; 23; 4; 35)</ref>, opinion mining and sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.41,453.74,16.38,8.74" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, recognizing textual entailment <ref type="bibr" coords="2,220.95,465.69,28.84,8.74">(5; 34)</ref>, or automatic style checking <ref type="bibr" coords="2,387.15,465.69,16.38,8.74" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. More generally, being able to deal adequately with modality and negation is relevant for any NLP task that requires some form of text understanding and needs to discriminate between factual and non-factual information, including text summarization, question answering, information extraction, and human-computer interaction in the form of dialogue systems.</p><p>Machine Reading (MR) is a task that aims at automatic unsupervised understanding of texts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.21,549.38,12.29,8.74" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Since modality and negation are very relevant phenomena for understanding texts, and, as far as we know, they have not been treated before in machine reading tasks, we proposed a pilot task on Processing modality and negation for machine reading as a pilot task of the Question Answering for Machine Reading Evaluation (QA4MRE)<ref type="foot" coords="2,313.15,595.63,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (REF in this volume) at CLEF 2011.</p><p>In Section 2 the task is described, Section 3 introduces the aspects of meaning to be processed, and Section 4 the complexity of the task. Unluckily, no partic-ipants submitted systems for this task, which means that we cannot describe systems nor provide evaluation results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task description</head><p>The pilot task follows the same set up as the main QA4MRE task. The goal of the QA4MRE evaluation (REF in this volume) is to develop a methodology for evaluating Machine Reading systems through Question Answering and Reading Comprehension Tests. Participating systems should be able to answer multiple choice questions about test documents, which requires a deep knowledge of the documents. Systems are asked to analyse the corresponding test document in conjunction with the background collections provided by the organization.</p><p>Finding the correct answer might require performing some kind of inference and processing previously acquired background knowledge from reference document collections. Although the additional knowledge obtained through the background collection may be used to assist with answering the questions, the principal answer is to be found among the facts contained in the test documents given. The main characteristics of the reading comprehension tests is that they not only require that systems perform semantic understanding, but they assume also a cognitive process that involves using implications and presuppositions, retrieving the stored information, and performing inferences to make implicit information explicit. The organization provides participants with a background collection of about 30,000 unannotated documents related to three topics: music and society, aids, and climate change. Background collections and tests are provided for several languages: English, Spanish, German, Italian, and Romanian.</p><p>The task Processing modality and negation for machine reading<ref type="foot" coords="3,422.75,424.27,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> is organised as a pilot task of the QA4MRE Lab. The pilot task aims at evaluating whether machine reading systems understand extra-propositional aspects of meaning beyond propositional content, focusing mostly on phenomena related to modality and negation.</p><p>Systems participating in the pilot task are supposed to learn from the background collections provided for the main task, although they will be evaluated on test sets designed specifically for the pilot task. The test documents come from the journal The Economist<ref type="foot" coords="3,275.99,519.91,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . The format of the test sets is the same as in the main task, four documents are provided per topic with ten multiple choice questions per document. Each question has five options, from which only one is correct. The options are exclusive. Questions are about how a certain event is presented in the document regarding five aspects of meaning: negation, perspective, certainty, modality and condition. The task can also be seen as a classification task in which systems have to generate the event description. This pilot task will evaluate how systems process the aspects of meaning presented in Section 3.</p><p>For example, given a sentence like <ref type="bibr" coords="4,305.52,118.99,12.73,8.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref> in the text, possible multiple choice options are listed in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,224.56,130.95,11.62,8.74" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The correct option would be (3.d).</p><p>(2) Experts consider that it is unclear whether the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy</p><p>(3) Event -the earthquake &lt;predicate&gt;add&lt;/predicate&gt; further threats to the global economy-is presented in the text as: a A negated event b A condition for another event c An event d An uncertain event from the perspective of someone other than the author -CORRECT e A purpose event In order to make the options machine readable, a code will be assigned to them. The aspects of meaning to be coded are presented in Section 3 and the full list of possible code combinations are listed in the Guidelines <ref type="foot" coords="4,418.85,316.21,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> .</p><p>A question focuses on an event mentioned in the document. The event and its participants are quoted almost literally in the formulation of the question. The difference with the literal quotation is that only the lemma of the event predicate appears in the question instead of the full form, and that negation and modality marks are also removed. For example, in (3), the lemma of the event predicate is add, which substitutes the full form will add that occurs in sentence <ref type="bibr" coords="4,444.68,389.51,11.62,8.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The question does not reproduce the full sentence where the event occurs, but only the event and its participants. In (2) the sentence is Experts consider that it is unclear whether the earthquake will add further threats to the global economy, but in the question only the event ADD and its participants are quoted, with the event marked with an xml like tag: the earthquake &lt;predicate&gt;add&lt;/predicate&gt; further threats to the global economy. For this task, event is understood in a broad sense, including actions, processes and states. Events can be expressed by verbs and nouns.</p><p>In order to allow participants to tune their systems, two pilot test document were released first <ref type="foot" coords="4,210.75,507.49,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . As in the main task, for each document there are ten multiple choice questions, each having five candidate answers, one clearly correct answer and four clearly incorrect answers. The task of a system is to choose one answer for each question, by analysing the corresponding test document in conjunction with the background collection.</p><p>We decided to provide test documents from The Economist because they are well written, the style is uniform for all texts, the journal relatively frequently addresses the topics established by the main task organizers, and they not only provide facts, but also opinionated statements, where modality phenomena can be found. last, but not least, The Economist agreed to release the text under a Creative Commons license, for which we are very grateful. As a negative aspect of these texts, they do not belong to the same type of texts as provided in the background collection of the main task. However, finding the right answers should be possible by analyzing the document at hand. Turn that noise off 677</p><p>The test documents can be downloaded from the web site of the of the main task <ref type="foot" coords="5,152.81,405.31,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . Since the pilot follows the main task setting of the main task, no annotated training data are provided. Apart from the background collection, systems can use any existing resources and data to solve the task.</p><p>As for evaluation, the pilot task is evaluated using the same procedure as the main task. Each question receives one (and only one) of the three following assessments: correct, if the system selected the correct answer among the five candidate ones; incorrect, if the system selected one of the wrong answers; NoA, if the system chose not to answer the question. Two evaluation measures are applied, c@1 (26), which takes into account the option of not answering certain questions, and accuracy. c@1 acknowledges the option of giving NoA answers in the proportion that a system answer questions correctly, which is measured using accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Aspects of meaning to be processed by systems</head><p>For this pilot task, five aspects of meaning related to modality and negation were selected. Systems have to choose the answer that best characterises an event along these six aspects described in the following subsections:</p><p>-Negation -Perspective -Certainty -Modality -Condition for another event or conditioned by another event</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Negation</head><p>An event can be presented as negated. In (4), the REPLACE event is negated with negation cue not. In (5), we consider &lt;PUT the sort of price on carbon use that would drive its emission down&gt; negated by the cue inability.</p><p>(4) But these new types of climate action do not replace the need to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>(5) In the face of an international inability to put the sort of price on carbon use that would drive its emission down, an increasing number of policy wonks, and the politicians they advise, are taking a more serious look at these other factors as possible ways of controlling climate change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Perspective</head><p>A statement is presented from the point of view of someone. By default the statement is presented from the perspective of the author of the text, but the author might be mentioning the view from someone else. The task will only evaluate whether systems are able to detect when an event is presented from a different perspective than the auhtor's. This is explicitly indicated in the multiple choice questions as perspective from someone other than the author. For example, in (6) the event &lt;radioactive particles from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant LEAD this once-prosperous city of 70,000 into a fight for its life&gt; is presented from the perspective of the mayor of Minamisoma.</p><p>(6) Yet he [coref: mayor of Minamisoma] believes the radioactive particles from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear-power plant, 25km from his office, have led this once-prosperous city of 70,000 into a fight for its life.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="6,161.43,528.42,12.73,8.74" target="#b6">(7)</ref> event &lt;LACK of testing equipment&gt; is presented from the perspective of traders in this places, event &lt;tuna that arrived in America SET aside by customs&gt; from the perspective of an executive at a Japanese trading house, and event &lt;Japanse food BE off the menu at hotels&gt; from the perspective of a sake brewer on a sales trip to Las Vegas. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,134.77,596.34,12.73,8.74" target="#b6">(7)</ref> The European Union has named a dozen prefectures that need radiation tests, yet traders in these places report a lack of testing equipment. In one case, says an executive at a Japanese trading house, tuna that arrived in America was set aside by customs, rotting before it was inspected. A sake brewer on a sales trip to Las Vegas noticed that Japanese food was off the menu at hotels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Certainty</head><p>Events can be presented with a range of certainty values, including underspecified certainty. Here we include all not certain events under the category of uncertain events, without distinguishing degrees.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Summary of cases to be learned by systems</head><p>Systems have to be able to identify for an event the six aspects of meaning described in the previous section. All events are assigned one of the following modality types:</p><p>-Event, purpose event, need event, obligation event, desire event If applicable, events can additionally be described with the following aspects of meaning that systems have to identify:</p><p>-Negated -Perspective of someone other than the author -Uncertain -Condition for another event, conditioned by another event So, an event description consists at least of one modality value and at most of one value per aspect of meaning.</p><p>The options provided in the multiple choice characterise and event along this five dimensions. Systems have to choose the answer that best characterises the event mentioned in the question. If no aspect apart from the modality type is mentioned in the possible answer options, we assume that the event is not negated, it is presented from the perspective from the author, it is certain or undefined qua certainty, it is not subject to a condition and it is not the condition for another event. In total there are 120 combinations, although not all of them will be represented in the test set of 12 documents because not all of them are equally frequent. The codes to be assigned to each of the values are: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>Although initially some groups inquired about the setting of the pilot task and declared to be prospective participants, in the end no systems submitted results. One of the reasons can be that the systems that participated in the main task were not designed to answer the type of questions defined for the pilot task and that the timeline of the Lab did not allowed time enough to modify the systems for the pilot task. On the other hand, systems that could be ready to process some aspect of modality and negation, like scope labelers, do not typically participate in machine reading tasks and are not fully prepared to deal with the five aspect of meaning selected for this pilot task.</p><p>As we see it, it would be possible to build a baseline system by using some of the existing scope labelers and/or designing a rule-based system. The task can be performed in three steps. First, the event needs to be located in the text and the sentence where the event occurs needs to be extracted. Although not all cases can be solved at sentence level, we could consider that working at this level would be acceptable to produce a baseline. Second, the sentence where the event occurs has to be processed to determine which of the values to assign for each of the five aspects of meaning. Third, an answer combining the tags for all aspects can be generated and it can be checked whether one of the multiple choice options contains the generated answer. Else, the most similar answer can be chosen.</p><p>To perform the second step, each of the meaning aspects should be processed apart. To determine whether the event is negated, a negation scope labeler could be use to determine whether the event is within the scope of a negation cue. The same procedure could be use to determine whether an event is uncertain, but using a hedge scope labeler. A factuality profiler like DeFacto (32) could also be used to determine whether an event is uncertain. To determine whether an event is conditioned or conditional, the syntactic structure of the sentence could be exploited to find whether the event is embedded in a conditional structure. To determine whether the event is presented from the perspective of someone other than the author it would be necessary to gather a list of expressions that are used to indicate perspective. Coreference resolution would also be needed to determine whether the pronouns corefer with the pronouns that refer to the author or not. As for the type of event qua modality, a combination of lexical look-up and syntactic analysis could help determining whether the event is presented as a purpose, need, obligation, or desire event.</p><p>Obviously, the task is much more complex than that. However, the approach would be sufficient to produce an informed baseline.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="10,138.97,282.38,76.58,8.74;10,138.97,294.34,244.55,8.74;10,138.97,306.29,104.36,8.74;10,138.97,318.25,54.80,8.74;10,158.68,332.19,91.88,8.74;10,158.68,344.15,133.89,8.74;10,158.68,356.10,120.66,8.74;10,158.68,368.06,145.43,8.74;10,158.68,380.02,128.49,8.74;10,138.97,393.96,58.67,8.74;10,158.68,407.91,167.35,8.74;10,158.68,419.87,193.75,8.74;10,149.71,441.78,330.88,8.74;10,134.77,453.74,218.63,8.74;10,134.77,487.61,322.08,8.74;10,151.70,500.25,158.35,7.86"><head>1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Negated: NEG 2.
