<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The QA4MRE 2011 task has been defined as an evaluation campaign of Machine Reading systems through Question Answering and Reading Comprehension Tests. Systems are asked to return a set of answered questions by extracting knowledge from given texts and using this knowledge to find the correct answer. Questions in the test will be in the form of multiple choice questions. The task focuses on the extraction of information of single documents and the use of previously-acquired background knowledge. Our approach, as we will describe, is oriented to discover knowledge from a co-occurrence graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Assumptions</head><p>Participants are provided with questions from three topics. Associated with each topic, a reference corpus is available consisting of about 30,000 un-annotated documents related to the topic. Documents in the corpus are used to acquire the background knowledge needed to answer a test on the topic.</p><p>Each topic is composed by several tests and each test consists of one single document and a set of multiple choice questions having five options each. Participants have the option of not answering the question or to answer the question by choosing one answer in each case. Our approach makes some assumptions that will be tested in the following sections, namely:</p><p>1. The documents included in the reference collection deal with issues related the topic they are associated.</p><p>2. It is possible to find enough information in the Web to compile a background knowledge similar to that provided by organizers.</p><p>3. There may be a vocabulary gap between the questions and the answers, so the document from the test and the background can be used to bridge this gap.</p><p>4. It is better not to answer a question whose answer is uncertain than to provide a wrong answer.</p><p>5. Documents translated to different languages tend to contain redundant information. This assumption avoids the management of multilingual texts that would require additional processing time and linguistic resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">System architecture</head><p>In this section we present the system developed for the QA4MRE 2011 task. Our graph-based approach is specifically designed to build a co-occurrence graph and uses the detected communities to find the correct answer to each question proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Background Preprocessing</head><p>The background knowledge on which we work in this paper is a reference corpus consisting of about 30,000 un-annotated documents related to the topic. Corpus preprocessing aims to create a structure of documents where every word is marked up as corresponding to a particular part of speech. All documents are lemmatised and PoS tagged using the GENIA tagger<ref type="foot" coords="2,386.62,536.28,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Instead of using all words to construct the graph, only nouns and verbs are used, since they are more discriminative than adverbs and adjectives. Accordingly, only nouns and verbs are kept and lemmatised.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Co-occurrence Graph</head><p>We consider a document to be a coherent piece of meaning, so that it is natural to make the basic assumption that all words appearing in the same document share a common meaning. Our aim is to create a link joining every two words sharing a common meaning, so co-occurrence in the same document will be taken as a proxy for this.</p><p>In order to construct the graph our algorithm extracts from each document the words that are common or proper nouns and verbs. The rest of the words are considered too common to discriminate the meaning.</p><p>The extracted words are then applied a stemming process, reducing them to their stem with the aim of increasing the significance of the number of occurrences. This is done applying the Porter algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,355.95,216.05,9.97,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. After these usual preprocessing steps, the algorithm considers each pair of words (stems) and computes the corresponding link between each pair of words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Detecting Communities</head><p>The weighted graph we have built contains the relationships between different words in the corpus. We apply an algorithm to detect communities of words with significant co-occurrence.</p><p>We have used the WalkTrap <ref type="bibr" coords="3,279.65,333.41,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> program to compute communities in large networks using random walks. This software measures the similarities between vertices based on random walks.</p><p>The algorithm starts from a partition of the graph into n communities corresponding to the vertices and merges communities in order to optimize a function called modularity which measures the quality of a partition. Distances between all adjacent vertices are computed and this partition evolves by means of an iterative process. Each iteration defines a community merging which gives a hierarchical structure of communities called dendrogram. The algorithm merges the different communities taking into account the distances between adjacent vertices. The quality of the communities generated at each step is used to choose the optimal partition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Question Answering</head><p>Each of the detected communities are treated as different contexts of a question in the corpus. In this way, the text of the question is assigned to a community and that community is considered the context of the question.</p><p>Each question is assigned to a community based on their similarity. The similarity between a question and each community is the co-occurrence of words in the text of the question and the community.</p><p>In the case of the answers the process is similar. First, each response is assigned to a community. Then, the response that has the highest similarity to the context of the question, is selected as the correct answer.</p><p>In some cases, it is not possible to assign the text of the question to just a community. Similarly, sometimes several answers get the highest similarity. In these cases the question is not answered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Scenarios</head><p>In this section we present two background collections used for the QA4MRE 2011 task. In addition, the main tuning parameters are described in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">First variant: QA4MRE-2011-EN corpus</head><p>Participants were allowed to submit a maximum of 10 runs. Also, first runs must have been produced using nothing more than the knowledge provided in the reference collection. For that reason, our first submitted runs use only the information provided in the QA4MRE-2011-EN corpus. However, additional runs could include other sources of information. Accordingly, the next section describe the other corpus used in the task.</p><p>In order to reduce the computation time, we have not used the whole reference collection in the experiments, but we have carried out a selection of the most relevant documents in the corpus to build the co-occurrence graph. We have created an index with the documents in the reference collection to retrieve and use only those that are most relevant to a particular question. The most relevant documents are obtained from the similarity measure used by the search engine implemented. The score of query q for document d correlates to the cosinedistance between the document and the query vectors in a vector space model (VSM) of information retrieval. A document whose vector is closer to the query vector in that model is scored higher.</p><p>Accordingly, we have carried out an indexing process where every document of the considered topics has been indexed by filtering stopwords extracted from a public list in the University of Glasgow<ref type="foot" coords="4,309.44,431.28,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . For indexing tasks we used Lucene <ref type="bibr" coords="4,463.05,432.85,13.16,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which is a source information retrieval library. In addition, we have decided to analyze the impact on the results of using stemming <ref type="bibr" coords="4,358.89,456.76,13.85,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For that, we have used the Stemming algorithm by Porter, which is available at the Snowball Web site <ref type="foot" coords="4,473.35,467.14,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Finally, the system has three different indices for each of the documents divided by topic. For each question, several queries are submitted to the index by retrieving a variable number of documents in each query. The number of documents retrieved in each case is a system parameter. Documents retrieved in each case are used to build the co-occurrence graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Second variant: IR process to build a new adapted corpus</head><p>The second variant is a slight modification of our original proposal. In this case, documents used to build the co-occurrence graph are retrieved from a commercial search engine. For that, we have used the open search web services platform of Yahoo! (BOSS 4 ). Documents are obtained by submitting several queries to the search engine composed of terms extracted from the different sources (text of the question, answers, topic). Our system performs a form of query expansion <ref type="bibr" coords="5,454.89,130.95,12.98,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a well-known method to improve the performance of information retrieval systems. In this method the expansion terms have to be very carefully selected to avoid worsening the query performance. The way in which terms are extracted and query expansion process is carried out is described in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,370.22,178.77,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,382.39,178.77,7.01,8.74" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Tuning parameters</head><p>The experiments generated for the task have been carried out considering different parameters in their configuration. First, we have used two reference collections; the collection provided by the organizers and another one built from a set of queries submitted to a search engine. Second, the number of documents retrieved for each query is an important factor affecting the size of the graph. Thus, several values were taken to analyze their influence on the results. Finally, in some cases the documents have been indexed by filtering stopwords and in other cases we have not used any filter.</p><p>The configuration of the different runs can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,413.12,326.71,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,162.07,608.08,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results for the submitted runs, including answered questions, unanswered, answered right, answered wrong, unanswered right, unanswered wrong, unanswered empty, and c@1 measure. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,182.20,644.17,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the results for submitted runs per topic. to each run submitted, it even improves results of the overall. Topic 2, that corresponds to 'Climate Change', gets the best c@1 measure, and far exceeds the runs 1 and 9 the overall measure. Topic 1 (AIDS) in almost all cases has obtained a c1 measure lower than overall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Analyzing the results, it can be said that the influence of the collection is a very important factor in the quality of the results. Although only one run (uned1109enen) has been submitted using the collection built from queries in a search engine, the difference is clear when compared with the equivalent run generated from the reference collection (uned1108enen). First, the number of answered questions is four times greater (67 vs 16) than with the collection provided by the organizers. Second, the c@1 measure is eight times higher (0.24 vs 0.03). This difference is surprising since the collection provided by the organizers should have only documents of a given topic, while queries in a search engine are performed on the whole Web. The number of retrieved documents is also an important factor in the results. In the case of retrieving 20 documents for each query, the c@1 measure obtained is more than 9 times (0.03 vs. 0.27) than retrieving 100 documents.</p><p>Finally, it was probed that filtering stopwords has not produced a clear effect on the results, although in previous experiments that filtering provided a significant difference as to compare the results. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,134.76,317.96,345.75,7.89;7,134.76,328.95,127.57,7.86;7,137.65,116.13,339.77,187.01"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
