<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the participation of UAIC team at the LogCLEF 2011 initiative, language identification task. Our approach is an aggregation of known methods for recognizing languages. Short texts are a real challenge in applying a language identification tool; so, our methods had to comply with it by resisting to noisy data as only one letter, only numbers, links, different symbols. We applied n-grams extraction with distance measurement computing and a learning algorithm. The results were satisfying on specific languages, considering that our system supports only a limited number of languages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The LogCLEF multilingual log analysis evaluation initiative has created the first long-term standard collection for evaluation purposes in the area of log analysis. The LogCLEF 2011 1 lab it is the continuation of the past two editions: as a pilot task in CLEF 2009, and a workshop in CLEF 2010.</p><p>In the last years, Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems and projects like Europeana 2 , CACAO 3 or MICHAEL 4 were oriented to support multilingual resources and to perform operations in a multilingual context <ref type="bibr" coords="1,423.10,513.25,10.69,9.05" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The aim of LogCLEF 2011 5 is the analysis and classification of queries in multilingual contexts. Log data constitute an important aspect that allows us to evaluate a search engine and the quality of a multilingual search service.</p><p>At LogCLEF 2011, organizers proposed three tasks 6 : (1) Language identification task: where participants are required to recognize the actual language of the query submitted; (2) Query classification: where participants are required to annotate each query with a label which represents a category of interest (for example, category can be Person, Geographic Location, Event, Work title, Domain Specific, Other); (3) Success of a query: where participants are required to study the trend of the success of a search. The success can be defined in terms of time spent on a page, number of clicked items, actions performed during the browsing of the result list.</p><p>In the following, we present the approach of our group to build a system for the first task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Language Identification</head><p>Our core language identification module is a component of the Sentimatrix 7 system <ref type="bibr" coords="2,124.82,272.39,10.68,9.05" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Language identification and modeling are used in many natural language processing applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, part-ofspeech tagging, parsing and information retrieval. These processes represent important steps in creating a viable system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">General language identification methods</head><p>Language detection is a preprocessing step problem of classifying a sample of characters based on its features (language-specific models). Currently, the system supports German, English, Greek, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovene, Czech and unknown language. We combined three methods for identifying the language: N-grams detection, strictly trigrams detection and unigrams, bigrams and trigrams detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,124.82,431.89,10.87,9.05" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,138.93,431.89,7.52,9.05" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.70,431.89,7.31,9.05" target="#b4">5]</ref>. We created a corpus for every language. This is constructed by samples of text and n-grams models. The models are created by extracting the n-grams from large data collection from European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus 1996-2009 8 . The trigrams models are approximately 100KB each.</p><p>There are three main methods for language detection: the first one is based on the trigrams models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.77,489.37,10.69,9.05" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the second one is based on sample texts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,373.99,489.37,11.69,9.05" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the third one on unigrams, bigrams and trigrams models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,292.25,500.89,10.70,9.05" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The language detection in the trigrams cases, for comparing the query's trigrams with corpus data, it is performed a distance measurement between languages profiles.</p><p>The N-grams classification method implies, along with computing frequencies, a posterior Naive Bayes implementation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,285.53,546.88,10.70,9.05" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The corpus for this method is used from corpus from the Cybozu Labs language detection library 9 . Each N-gram i from every language j is mapped with a frequency: http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 9 Language Detection library: http://code.google.com/p/language-detection/ C (i, j): Count of the i-th N-gram in the j-th language, Σi C(i, j): Sum of the counts of all the N-grams in language j. We compute a posterior Naive Bayes: L k : Language category, X: Document whose language needs to be detected (set of features F j ), F j : Feature/N-gram j of document.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,136.22,630.15,186.50,9.06">P (i, j): Frequency of a N-gram i in language j,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P(L k |X)</head><p>for every language k knowing in order to classify the test document is computed normalizing at every step, in concordance with P(i, j), the probability until it becomes closer to 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Short or ambiguous query specific methods</head><p>The methods described in the previous section are applicable to a general language identification task. We will now present the main issues encountered when dealing with language identification for very short queries and several methods to overcome these problems.</p><p>A first issue was the significant number of queries for which the language was unknown or undecided. We preserved the notation used in the annotated queries for this situation and we attributed the "zxx" value to the queries we decided that fall in one of the two previous categories. There are several reasons that a query cannot be linked to a certain language. The most obvious ones were the cases in which the query contained mostly digits, such as dates or ISBN codes and when the query had less than three characters. These can be easily treated by identifying numerical patterns in the query or, in the second case, by checking the length of the query.</p><p>A much more difficult task appears when an undecided language tag is associated with the query due to the fact that in the query appears a named entity, which can be a person or a geographical entity or the title of a literary work is found in the query. This kind of query is generally treated as language independent, but sometimes language specific diacritics or spelling can suggest the origin of the named entity without any other background knowledge. It can be observed that even the inner annotator agreement is low on this situation. For example, the query "marquis angelo gabrielli" marked as having the type Person has "zxx" in the language tag, but the query "karvinen marita", also a Person is considered to be in the "fin" (Finish) language.</p><p>We managed to improve our results by building and using dictionary that maps specific diacritics to a source language. If a special character can be found only in a single language, then the problem is solved. If the character is common in more than one language, then the probabilities of belonging to one of those languages, calculated by the methods described in the 2.1 section, are given a boost.</p><p>As a solution for when we weren't able to identify the language strictly from the form of the query, we introduced a threshold for the probabilistic values. If the language with highest probability for a query has the score under the threshold, then the language will be "zxx". We settled on a threshold value of 0.70. We will discuss how we obtained this value in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments and results</head><p>We used the queries provided after the query annotation task of this year's LogCLEF initiative for our system's evaluation. There were 25 languages used, including "zxx" for unknown or undecided totaling a number of 510 queries. We show in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,450.46,260.87,4.98,9.05" target="#tab_0">1</ref> the distribution of queries by language. As it can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,261.04,407.29,3.76,9.05" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, an important number of languages are poorly represented and we didn't train our system for some of these languages. This translates to lowering the maximum achievable accuracy. If we disregard the languages that have less than 10 queries in the collection, we can expect a maximum 9.01% drop of accuracy.</p><p>In our best experiment, we obtained a global accuracy of 62.54 %. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,448.66,464.77,3.77,9.05" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we provide detailed results of the accuracy obtained by our system for every language, including the ones that are represented by only one query. We can observe very encouraging results, 90 % accuracy for queries marked as unknown or undecided. These results are important because this is one of the top priority values that we tried to maximize. One of the focuses of our research for the language identification task was to find ways to improve the number of correctly identified "zxx" queries. On the other hand, we obtained a less than expected accuracy for the English language.</p><p>An interesting result is the high accuracy for languages that use a particular character set, such as Russian or Greek. This gives us confidence in our diacritics dictionary method. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,180.69,393.13,3.76,9.05" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we can observe the influence of the threshold introduced in the previous section over the global accuracy and the accuracy for the "zxx" tagged queries. As expected, from a certain point a tradeoff appears between the global accuracy and the "zxx" accuracy. We chose 0.70 as the threshold due to the fact that it gives the best value for the general accuracy. Language identification and modeling deserve necessary involvement from out team and it is important to continue investigating N-grams extracting more accurately. A large corpus would be needed, along with manual help. Noisy data was an important challenge that we think that we managed to cover partially, by using Naïve Bayes Classifier and alphabet diacritics that basically covered more than thirty percent of queries.</p><p>In conclusion, we need to better apply more language modeling techniques and to improve the ability of training the system on more languages. In addition, it will be interesting to participate in further LogCLEF initiative tasks, channeling our attention on more tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,124.82,653.30,3.00,5.45;2,133.34,655.18,119.48,8.18;2,124.82,663.62,3.00,5.45;2,133.34,665.50,223.81,8.18"><head>7</head><label></label><figDesc>Sentimatrix: www.sentimatrix.eu 8 European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus 1996-2009:</figDesc></figure>
