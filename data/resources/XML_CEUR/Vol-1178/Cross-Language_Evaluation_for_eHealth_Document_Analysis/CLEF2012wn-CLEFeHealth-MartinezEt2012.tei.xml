In the description below, we focus on detecting the presence of aspergillosis; however, we anticipate the approach to be transferable to other diseases or conditions by training the text mining component over appropriate reports. Previous systems based on language technology have been deployed for processing radiology reports and for detecting hospital acquired infection using language-processing technology, with significant success. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.10,430.50,4.86,5.83" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.12,430.50,3.24,5.83" target="#b2">3</ref> Our approach differs by using a purely statistical/machine-learning approach to the language technology, and by being trained and tested on data collected from a number of hospitals.</p><p>Our text mining technique will form the core of a notification and surveillance system that raises an alarm with a clinical team or nursing station overseeing the health of hospitalised patients. The resulting system can include a multitude of text classifiers, each trained to detect specified conditions over a written report for any scan performed on any patient. Ultimately, the text mining component will be part of a pervasive surveillance system which also monitors other types of data, such as lab results and images, and combines all pertinent information to produce high-accuracy detection. In addition to surveillance at hospital and patient levels, the system enables capturing and visualising the underlying evidence for a given classification decision at report and sentence levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials and Methods</head><p>Data collection: We collected data for patients with 288 IFD and 291 control patients from three different hospitals in Melbourne, Australia: Alfred Health, Melbourne Health, and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. The data consisted of the reports for all the scans performed on the patient over the hospitalisation period. For each scan, we use the written report (i.e., the radiologist's narrative) that describes the observations, and the state of the patient. From our initial set, we extracted a sample of 69 IFD and patient had possibly multiple scans (and associated reports), resulting in a total of 398 scan reports from IFD-positive patients and 83 scan reports from control patients. Annotation: We extended the patient-level classification by having medical experts annotate all the scan reports at both sentence and report level. The annotators had to decide, for each sentence and report, whether it was positive, neutral, or negative with regards to IFD. We used three assessors for the task, and performed double-blind annotation over the IFD patients in order to measure the annotation agreement. The process was performed as follows: the whole dataset was annotated by the main annotator, and the other two experts split the data, and each annotated half of the collection. The guidelines were initially set by the main annotator, and refined through discussion after annotating a small sample of the data. For control patients, we considered that the presence of IFD-positive annotations would be minimal, and we relied only on our main annotator for this task.</p><p>Methods: Our prediction system is based on supervised sentence classification, where a ML method predicts if a given sentence is indicative of IFD or not. We classify reports and patients as IFD-positive if they contain at least one positive sentence, and as negative otherwise. The underlying ML classifier is an implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) -we used the Weka toolkit's SVM implementation. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,467.35,354.42,3.24,5.83" target="#b3">4</ref> We employed a variety of text-and concept-based features, including bag-of-words, punctuation, UMLS concepts and negated contexts extracted using MetaMap. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,449.35,377.46,3.24,5.83" target="#b4">5</ref> We also automatically extracted high-value terms (as measured using the log-likelihood ratio test) and formulated multi-word concept descriptions (further details will be presented in full paper). For evaluation we used 10-fold cross-validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>Performance of the system at the report and patient levels (i.e., for detecting scans that seem to indicate evidence of aspergillosis and for classifying patients who have at least one (detected) positive report against the set of patients known to have been IFD-positive, respectively) is summarised in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,343.07,505.19,3.76,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. High performance at report level is a prerequisite for any real-time detection system. Current work is being performed to improve on these results, but the values reported below are already quite strong. By comparison, the expert annotators' agreement over IFD-positive and IFDnegative sentences was 0.64 and 0.58 respectively, using Cohen's kappa. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Future hospital information systems with IFD-surveillance capabilities would present an improvement on current practice where prospective IFD surveillance is not performed in the vast majority of centres. This surveillance requires high performance, especially sensitivity, at the patient level. Our current results suggest that this is feasible. Questions remain regarding installation in a hospital environment, including how to ensure system performance continues to improve if/when misclassifications are made. Focusing on surveillance (as opposed to real-time detection) simplifies this somewhat; we intend to explore this further in future planned trials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="3,124.70,586.60,330.75,47.10"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Performance at the report and patient levels.
