<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using Twitter as an effective marketing tool has become a gold mine for companies interested in their online reputation. A quite significant research challenge related to the above issue is to disambiguate tweets with respect to company names. In fact, finding if a particular tweet is relevant or irrelevant to a company is an important task not satisfactorily solved yet; to address this issue in this paper we propose a Wikipedia-based two-pass algorithm. The experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Twitter 1 is a microblogging site which currently 2 ranks 8 th world wide in total traffic according to Alexa 3 . This huge popularity has turned Twitter into an effective marketing platform with almost all the major companies maintaining Twitter accounts. Moreover, Twitter users often express their opinions about companies via 140-character long Twitter messages called tweets <ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.08,493.65,10.56,9.96" target="#b6">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="1,435.12,493.65,14.59,9.96" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Companies are highly interested in monitoring their online reputation; this, however involves the significant challenge of disambiguating company names in text. The task becomes even more challenging in tweets due to huge noise, short length and lack of context for company name disambiguation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,382.32,541.53,24.75,9.96">[6] [7]</ref>. This paper describes our experience in dealing with some of these challenges in the context of RepLab2012 filtering task where we are given a set of companies and for each company a set of tweets, which contain some tweets relevant to the company and some irrelevant ones.</p><p>Our approach consists in a two-pass filtering algorithm that makes use of Wikipedia as an external knowledge resource in the first pass, and a concept 1 http://twitter.com 2 Data as of July 31, 2012 3 http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/twitter.com term score propagation mechanism in the second pass. The first step is precisionoriented, where the aim is to keep the noisy tweets to a minimum. The second step enhances the recall via a score propagation technique, and by making use of other sources of evidence. Our technique shows high accuracy over the Re-pLab2012 dataset.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents a more detailed description of the considered problem. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology in detail. Section 4 gives presents the experimental evaluation of our method, and Section 5 summarizes the related work. Finally section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem Statement</head><p>In this section we give a brief overview of the RepLab2012 filtering task. We were given company names and a set of tweets obtained via issuing a query (i.e. the name of the company) to Twitter Search<ref type="foot" coords="2,312.72,304.78,3.97,4.84" target="#foot_0">4</ref> . Due to the issue of noise in Twitter, the tweets obtained via the query may or may not be relevant to the company. Our task addresses the problem of distinguishing the tweets relevant from those non-relevant to a company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>This section describes the proposed filtering method in detail. We first explain how we use Wikipedia as an external knowledge resource: we use only portions of a company's Wikipedia page, as only some of the portions are meaningful for filtering purposes. Next, we explain the two steps of our algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Wikipedia as External Knowledge Resource</head><p>As Meij et al. point out in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,250.68,482.97,9.90,9.96" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, a simple matching between tweets and Wikipedia texts would produce a significant amount of irrelevant and noisy concept terms. The authors further mention that such noise can be eliminated on either the Wikipedia or the textual side. On the basis of the intuition that the Wikipedia page of a company contains significant information about the company in certain portions of the Wikipedia article (i.e. concept terms exist in some portions of text), we perform this cleaning on the Wikipedia side as follows:</p><p>we use the information within the Wikipedia infoboxes.</p><p>we use the information within the Wikipedia category box.</p><p>we parse the paragraphs that in the Wikipedia text are followed by application of POS tagging to these paragraphs. After the application of POS tagging, we extract unigrams, bigrams and trigrams for the significant POS tags [1].</p><p>Finally, the concept terms extracted from the various portions of Wikipedia are split into single terms. These are then used for matching against the terms in the tweets for the task of filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">First Pass</head><p>After collecting all the extracted concept terms from Wikipedia we order them by their specificity in the Wikipedia article thereby giving a score to each term. We then check for the occurrence of these concept terms in the tweets, and the number of occurrences per term is multiplied by the score of that particular concept term to constitute a score for the tweet. Tweets that have a score above a certain threshold are considered to be relevant. The intuition behind the use of Wikipedia concept terms for the first phase is to keep the precision as high as possible, and to get relevant tweets only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Second Pass</head><p>The second pass makes use of the idea of concept term score propagation in order to discover more tweets relevant to a particular company i.e. to increase the recall. The score propagation technique is based on the intuition that terms colocated with significant concept terms may have some relevance to that concept. The scores for concept terms in a relevant tweet obtained from the first pass are redistributed among co-located terms. This in turn gives some score to the nonconcept terms, and by using the scores of these non-concept terms we perform a second computation to obtain the scores of tweets. Moreover, this phase uses more sources of evidence, these are:</p><p>-POS tag of the company name occurring within the tweets -URL occurring within the tweets -Twitter username occurring within the tweets -Hashtag occurring within the tweets The score propagation technique as well as the extra sources of evidence mentioned above enable us to extract more tweets relevant to the company, thus increasing the recall. We show the results of the evaluation metrics in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Evaluations</head><p>As mentioned in section 2 the task comprises binary classification and hence we report the effectiveness of our algorithm through the standard evaluation metrics of precision and recall. We were given a very small trial dataset (six companies) and a considerably larger test dataset (31 companies). We report our results for the test dataset. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,306.24,631.53,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the precision and recall figures after the application of the first pass, and after the application of the second pass of our algorithm. As Table <ref type="table" coords="4,191.76,203.37,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the first pass yields a high precision but an extremely low recall. The application of the second pass increases the recall by a large degree, while not overly reducing the precision. The significantly large increase in recall proves the effectiveness of the score-propagation technique combined with the use of multiple sources of evidence.</p><p>The RepLab2012 filtering task used the measures of Reliability and Sensitivity for evaluation purposes, these are described in detail in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,393.24,275.13,9.99,9.96" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,437.04,275.13,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents a snapshot of the official results for the Filtering task of RepLab 2012, where CIRGDISCO is the name of our team. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,177.36,434.25,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that our algorithm performed competitively. It is the second best among the submitted systems and fourth best among the submitted runs. We only managed to submit a single run due to the shortage of time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>There has been an increasing interest in research on applying natural language processing techniques to tweets over the past few years. We provide an overview of some of these works in this section.</p><p>Named entity recognition in tweets has been an area of active research over the past few years with a focus on semi-supervised learning techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="4,452.88,559.77,10.44,9.96" target="#b3">[5]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,467.28,559.77,9.99,9.96" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a two-pass algorithm for company name disambiguation in tweets. Our algorithm makes use of Wikipedia as a primary knowledge resource in the first pass of the algorithm, and the tweets are matched across Wikipedia terms. The matched terms are then used for score propagation in the second pass of the algorithm that also makes use of multiple sources of evidence. Our algorithm showed competitive performance and demonstrates the effectiveness of the techniques employed in the two passes. As a future work, we aim to refine the score propagation technique of the second pass by taking into account better features for effective scores computation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="4,134.76,93.12,315.36,76.65"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Precision and Recall Scores for Two Passes of the Algorithm</figDesc><table coords="4,134.76,93.12,238.59,55.77"><row><cell>IV</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>First Pass Second Pass</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Precision 0.84827 0.81129</cell></row><row><cell>Recall</cell><cell>0.16307 0.76229</cell></row></table></figure>
