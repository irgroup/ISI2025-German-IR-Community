<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This article describes the participation of the Image and Text Integration (ITI) group in the ImageCLEF 2012 medical retrieval and classification tasks. Our group is from the Communications Engineering Branch of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, which is a division of the U. S. National Library of Medicine.</p><p>The medical track <ref type="bibr" coords="1,234.81,449.26,15.81,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> of ImageCLEF 2012 consists of an image modality classification task and two retrieval tasks. For the classification task, the goal is to classify a given set of medical images according to thirty-one modalities (e.g., "Computerized Tomography," "Electron Microscopy," etc.). The modalities are organized hierarchically into meta-classes such as "Radiology" and "Microscopy," which are themselves types of "Diagnostic Images." In the first retrieval task, a set of ad-hoc information requests is given, and the goal is to retrieve the most relevant images from a collection of biomedical articles for each topic. Finally, in the second retrieval task, a set of case-based information requests is given, and the goal is to retrieve the most relevant articles describing similar cases.</p><p>In the following sections, we describe the textual and visual features that comprise our image and article representations (Sections 2-3) and our methods for the modality classification (Section 4) and medical retrieval tasks (Sections 5-6). Our textual approaches primarily utilize the Unified Medical Language System R (UMLS R ) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,221.54,610.21,15.30,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> synonymy to identify concepts in topic descriptions and article text, and our visual approaches rely on computed distances between descriptors of various low-level visual features. In developing mixed approaches, we explore the use of clustered visual features that can be represented using text, attribute selection, and ranked list merging strategies.</p><p>In Section 7 we describe our submitted runs, and in Section 8 we present our results. For the modality classification task, our best submission achieved a classification accuracy of 63.2% and was ranked within the submissions from the top three participating groups. Our best submission for the ad-hoc image retrieval task was ranked first overall, achieving a mean average precision of 0.2377, which is a statistically significant improvement over the second ranked submission. For the case-based article retrieval task, our best submission achieved a mean average precision of 0.1035 and was ranked within the submissions from the top four participating groups, but this submission is statistically indistinguishable from our other case-based submissions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Image Representation for Ad-hoc Retrieval</head><p>We represent the images contained in biomedical articles using a combination of the textual and visual features described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Textual Features</head><p>We represent each image in the collection as a structured document of imagerelated text called an enriched citation. Our representation includes the title, abstract, and MeSH R terms<ref type="foot" coords="2,259.68,322.87,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> of the article in which the image appears as well as the image's caption and "mentions" (snippets of text within the body of an article that discuss an image). These features can be indexed with a traditional text-based information retrieval system, or they may be exposed as term vectors and combined with the visual feature vectors described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Features</head><p>In addition to the above textual features, we also represent the visual content of images using various low-level visual descriptors. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,401.30,411.79,5.08,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the descriptors we extract and their dimensionality. Due to the large number of these features, we forego describing them in any detail. However, they are all well-known and discussed extensively in existing literature.</p><p>Cluster Words. To avoid the computational complexity of computing distances between the above visual descriptors, we create a textual representation of visual features that is easily integrated with our existing textual features. For each visual descriptor listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,275.94,496.44,3.89,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we cluster the vectors assigned to all images using the k-means++ <ref type="bibr" coords="2,229.62,507.91,10.31,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> algorithm. We then assign each cluster a unique "cluster word" and represent each image as a sequence of these words. We add an image's cluster words to its enriched citation as a "global image feature" field, which can be searched using a traditional text-based information retrieval system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attribute</head><p>Selection. An orthogonal approach to transforming our visual descriptors into a computationally manageable representation is attribute selection. By eliminating unneeded or redundant information, these techniques can also improve our modality classification and image retrieval methods. We perform attribute selection using the WEKA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,299.06,604.04,10.73,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref> data mining software. First, we group all our visual descriptors into a single combined vector, and we then perform attribute selection to reduce the dimensionality of this combined feature. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Article Representation for Case-based Retrieval</head><p>We represent articles using the textual features of each image appearing in the article. Thus, each article enriched citation consists of its title, abstract, and MeSH terms as well as the caption and mention of each contained image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Modality Classification Task</head><p>We experimented with both flat and hierarchical modality classification methods. Below we describe our flat classification strategy, an extension of this approach that exploits the hierarchical structure of the classes, and a post-processing method for improving the classification accuracy of illustrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Flat Classification</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,166.68,522.82,10.13,8.74" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> provides an overview of our basic classification approach. We utilize multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) as our flat modality classifiers. First, we extract our visual and textual image features from the training images (representing the textual features as term vectors). Then, we perform attribute selection to reduce the dimensionality of the features. We construct the lowerdimensional vectors independently for each feature type (textual or visual) and combine the resulting attributes into a single, compound vector. Finally, we use the lower-dimensional feature vectors to train multi-class SVMs for producing textual, visual, or mixed modality predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Hierarchical Classification</head><p>Unlike the flat classification strategy described above, it is possible to exploit the hierarchical organization of the modality classes in order to decompose the task into several smaller classification problems that can be sequentially applied. Based on our visual observation of the training samples and our initial experiments, we modified the original modality hierarchy <ref type="bibr" coords="4,308.40,318.79,15.19,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed for the task. The hierarchy we used for our experiments is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,343.81,330.27,8.86,8.74" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. We train flat multi-class SVMs, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,366.30,341.74,8.32,8.74" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, for each meta-class. For recognizing compound images, we utilize the algorithm proposed by Apostilova et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,148.43,364.70,9.79,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which detects sub-figure labels and the border of each sub-figure within a compound image. To arrive at a final class label, an image is sequentially classified beginning at the root of the hierarchy until a leaf class can be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Illustration Post-processing</head><p>Because our initial classification experiments resulted in only modest accuracy for the fourteen "Illustration" classes shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,381.51,428.87,9.03,8.74" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, we concluded that our current textual and visual features may not be sufficient for representing these figures. Therefore, in addition to the aforementioned machine learning modality classification methods, we also developed several complimentary rulebased strategies for increasing the classification accuracy of "Illustration" classes.</p><p>A majority of the training samples contained in the "Illustration" meta-class, unlike other images in the collection, consist of line drawings or text superimposed on a white background. For example, program listings mostly consist of text; thus, the use of text and line detection methods may increase the classification accuracy of Class GPLI. Similarly, polygons (e.g., rectangles, hexagons, etc.) contained in flowcharts (GFLO), tables (GTAB), system overviews (GSYS), and chemical structures (GCHE) are a distinctive feature of these modalities. We utilize the methods of Jung et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,291.22,566.59,15.81,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and OpenCV<ref type="foot" coords="4,370.54,565.02,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> functions to assess the presence of text and polygons, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Ad-Hoc Image Retrieval Task</head><p>In this section we describe our textual, visual and mixed approaches to the ad-hoc image retrieval task. Descriptions of the submitted runs that utilize these methods are presented in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Textual Approaches</head><p>To allow for efficient retrieval and to compare their relative performance, we index our enriched citations with the Essie <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.81,143.34,10.31,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Lucene/SOLR<ref type="foot" coords="5,412.00,141.76,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> search engines. Essie is a search engine developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and is particularly well-suited for the medical retrieval task due to its ability to automatically expand query terms using the UMLS synonymy. Lucene/SOLR is a popular search engine developed by the Apache Software Foundation that employs the well-known vector space model of information retrieval. We have extracted the UMLS synonymy from Essie and use it for term expansion when indexing enriched citations with Lucene/SOLR.</p><p>We organize each topic description into a frame-based (e.g., PICO<ref type="foot" coords="5,444.46,234.39,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> ) representation following the method similar to that described by Demner-Fushman and Lin <ref type="bibr" coords="5,171.71,258.92,9.88,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Extractors identify concepts related to problems, interventions, age, anatomy, drugs, and modality. We also identify modifiers of the extracted concepts and a limited number of relationships among them. We then transform the extracted concepts into queries appropriate for either Essie or Lucene/SOLR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Visual Approaches</head><p>Our visual approaches to image retrieval are based on retrieving images that appear visually similar to the given topic images. We compute the visual similarity between two images as the Euclidean distance between their visual descriptors. For the purposes of computing this distance, we represent each image as a combined feature vector composed of a subset of the visual descriptors listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,161.80,383.89,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> after attribute selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Mixed Approaches</head><p>We explore several methods of combing our textual and visual approaches. One such approach involves the use of our image cluster words. For performing multimodal retrieval using cluster words, we first extract the visual descriptors listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,200.79,451.47,5.02,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> from each example image of a given topic. We then locate the clusters to which the extracted descriptors are nearest in order to determine their corresponding cluster words. Finally, we combine these cluster words with words taken from the topic description to form a multimodal query appropriate for either Essie or Lucene/SOLR.</p><p>While the use of cluster words allows us to create multimodal queries, we can instead directly combine the independent outputs of our textual and visual approaches. In a score merging approach, we apply a min-max normalization to the ranked lists of scores produced by our textual and visual retrieval strategies. We then linearly combine the normalized scores given to each image to produce a final ranking. Similarly, a rank merging approach combines the results of our textual and visual approaches using the ranks of the retrieved images instead of their normalized scores. To produce the final image ranking using this strategy, we re-score each retrieved image as the reciprocal of its rank and then repeat the above procedure for combining scores.</p><p>Another means of incorporating visual information with our retrieval approaches is through the use of a modality classifier. Using our hierarchical modality classification approach, we can first determine the most probable modalities for a topic's example images. After retrieving a set of images using either our textual or visual methods, we can eliminate retrieved images that are not of the same modality as the topic images. An advantage of performing hierarchical classification is that we can filter the retrieved results using the meta-classes within the hierarchy (e.g., "Radiology").</p><p>Finally, we often combine the retrieval results produced by several queries into a single ranked list of images. We perform this query combination, or padding, by simply appending the ranked list of images retrieved by a subsequent query to the end of the ranked list produced by the preceding query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Case-Based Retrieval Task</head><p>Our method for performing case-based retrieval is analogous to our textual approaches for ad-hoc image retrieval. Here, we index the enriched citations described in Section 3 using the Essie and Lucene/SOLR search engines (for performance comparison). We generate textual and mixed queries appropriate for both search engines according to the approaches described in Sections 5.1.</p><p>As a form of query expansion for case-based topics, we also explore the possibility of determining relevant disease names to correspond with signs and symptoms found in a topic case. To determine a set of potential diseases, we first use the Google Search API<ref type="foot" coords="6,249.95,377.04,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">5</ref> to search the World Wide Web using a topic case as a query. We then process the top five documents with MetaMap <ref type="bibr" coords="6,423.14,390.09,10.72,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to extract terms having the UMLS semantic type "Disease or Syndrome." Finally, we select the top three most frequent diseases for query expansion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Submitted Runs</head><p>In this section we describe each of our submitted runs for the modality classification, ad-hoc image retrieval, and case-based article retrieval tasks. Each run is identified by its submission file name or trec_eval run ID and mode (textual, visual or mixed). All submitted runs are automatic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Modality Classification Task</head><p>We submitted the following nine runs for the modality classification task:</p><p>M1 all the images contained in the retrieval collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Ad-hoc Image Retrieval Task</head><p>We submitted the following ten runs for the ad-hoc image retrieval task: A1. nlm-se (mixed): A combination of three queries using Essie. (A1.Q1) A disjunction of modality terms extracted from the query topic must occur within the caption or mention fields of an image's enriched citation; a disjunction of the remaining terms is allowed to occur in any field. (A1.Q2) A lossy expansion of the verbatim topic is allowed to occur in any field. (A1.Q3) A disjunction of the query images' cluster words must occur within the global image feature field. A2. nlm-se-cw-mf (mixed): A combination of Query A1.Q1 with the additional query below using Essie. (A2.Q2) A lossy expansion of the verbatim topic is allowed occur in any field of an image's enriched citation and a disjunction of the query images' cluster words can optionally occur within the global image feature field. Additionally, the retrieved images are filtered so that they share a least common ancestor modality with the query images, as determined by the modality classifier used in Run M9. Query A2.Q2 is distinct from Queries 1.Q2-3 in that the occurrence of a lossy expansion of the topic is not necessarily weighted more heavily than the occurrence of image cluster words.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Results</head><p>We present and discuss the results of our modality classification, ad-hoc image retrieval, and case-based article retrieval task submissions below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Modality Classification Task</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,160.70,426.58,4.88,8.74" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the classification accuracy of our submitted runs for the modality classification task. Visual Text Hierarchy w Postprocessing 4 Illustration.txt, a mixed approach, achieved the highest accuracy (63.2%) of our submitted runs and was ranked fifth overall. However, it ranked within the submissions from the top three participating groups. This result validates our post-processing method used to improve the recognition of "Illustration" classes, and provides, with our previous experience <ref type="bibr" coords="9,226.53,495.44,14.90,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, further evidence that hierarchical classification is a successful strategy. Each of our hierarchical classification methods outperforms the corresponding flat approach having the same feature representation. While our submitted runs were only judged on their ability to identify each of the thirty-one modality classes <ref type="bibr" coords="9,271.86,541.35,14.60,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="9,320.83,541.35,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref> presents the classification accuracy of the intermediate classifiers we used for our hierarchical approaches. For each meta-class in the hierarchy shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,336.33,564.30,9.03,8.74" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, Table <ref type="table" coords="9,382.33,564.30,5.08,8.74" target="#tab_3">3</ref> gives the number of classes they contain; the classification accuracy associated with the textual, visual, and mixed feature representations; and the dimensionality of the mixed feature representation after attribute selection. These results demonstrate that the accuracies of the intermediate classifiers generally improve as the number of class labels decreases. Given the limited amount of training data in relation to the number of total modalities, the smaller number of labels per classifier likely is significant for explaining why our hierarchical classification approaches consistently outperform their corresponding flat approaches.   <ref type="table" coords="10,162.01,434.38,5.02,8.74" target="#tab_4">4</ref> presents the mean average precision (MAP), binary preference (bpref), and early precision (P@10) of our submitted runs for the ad-hoc image retrieval task. nlm-se achieved the highest MAP (0.2377) among our submitted runs and was ranked first overall. Merge RankToScore weighted, the run achieving our second highest MAP (0.2166), was ranked second overall. Comparing these two runs using Fisher's paired randomization test <ref type="bibr" coords="10,341.78,491.76,14.90,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a recommended statistical test for evaluating information retrieval systems, we find that nlm-se achieved a statistically significant increase (9.7%, p = 0.0016) over the performance of Merge RankToScore weighted.</p><p>That the two highest ranked runs were multimodal, as apposed to textual, is an encouraging result, and provides evidence that our ongoing efforts at integrating textual and visual information will be successful. In particular, the use by nlm-se and other runs of cluster words, which are indexed and retrieved using a traditional text-based information retrieval system, is an effective way, not only of incorporating visual information with text, but of avoiding the computational expense common among content-based retrieval methods. Furthermore, Merge RankToScore weighted demonstrates the value of rank merging when combining textual and visual retrieval results. Some of our other mixed runs, in utilizing the results of our modality classifiers, may have been weakened due to the modest performance of our classification methods.  <ref type="table" coords="11,161.81,270.92,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">5</ref> presents the MAP, bpref, and P@10 of our submitted runs for the casebased article retrieval task. nlm-lc-total-sum, a textual approach using language model similarity, achieved the highest MAP (0.1035) among our submitted runs and was ranked seventh overall. However, it ranked within the submissions from the top four participating groups. Using Fisher's paired randomization test, we find that there is no statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in MAP among any of our submitted runs. The relatively low performance of most of the ImageCLEF 2012 case-based submissions may be due, in part, to the existence in the collection of only a small number of case reports, clinical trials, or other types of documents relevant for case-based topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>This article describes the methods and results of the Image and Text Integration (ITI) group in the ImageCLEF 2012 medical retrieval and classification tasks.</p><p>For the modality classification task, our best submission was ranked within the submissions from the top three participating groups. Our best submission for the ad-hoc image retrieval task was ranked first overall. Finally, for the case-based article retrieval task, our best submission was ranked within the submissions from the top four participating groups, though we found no statistical significance between this run and our other case-based submissions. The effectiveness of our multimodal approaches are encouraging and provide evidence that our ongoing efforts at integrating textual and visual information will be successful.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,425.43,172.50,8.59,3.03;4,422.81,178.52,8.07,2.53;4,423.03,183.84,7.61,2.53;4,422.88,189.15,7.91,2.53"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Photo DVDM DVEN DVOR</figDesc></figure>
