<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ninth edition of the ImageCLEF medical image retrieval and classification tasks was organized in 2012. A subset of the open access collection of PubMed Central was used as the database in 2012, using a larger number of over 300'000 images than in 2011. As in previous years, there were three subtasks: modality classification, image-based and case-based retrieval. A new hierarchy for article figures was created for the modality classification task. The modality detection could be one of the most important filters to limit the search and focus the results sets. The goal of the image-based and the case-based retrieval tasks were similar compared to 2011 adding mainly complexity. The number of groups submitting runs has remained stable at 17, with the number of submitted runs remaining roughly the same with 202 (207 in 2011). Of these, 122 were image-based retrieval runs, 37 were case-based runs while the remaining 43 were modality classification runs. Depending on the exact nature of the task, visual, textual or multimodal approaches performed better.</p><p>medical image classification and retrieval; photo annotation and retrieval (large-scale web, Flickr, and personal photo tasks); plant identification; robot vision.</p><p>The medical image classification and retrieval task in 2012 is a use case of the PROMISE 3 network of excellence and is supported by the project. This task covers image modality classification and image retrieval with visual, semantic and mixed topics in several languages using a data collection from the biomedical literature. This year, there are three types of tasks in the medical image classification and retrieval task:</p><p>modality classification; image-based retrieval; case-based retrieval.</p><p>This article presents the main results of the tasks and compares results between the various participating groups and the techniques employed.</p></div>

Following the format introduced in 2010, two forms of labs were offered: labs could either be run as benchmarking activities campaign-style during the ten month period preceding the conference, or as workshop-style labs that explore possible benchmarking activities and provide a means to discuss information retrieval evaluation challenges from various perspectives.</p><p>ImageCLEF<ref type="foot" coords="1,202.70,604.14,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="1,209.39,605.71,8.19,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,217.58,605.71,4.10,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,217.58,605.71,4.10,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,221.68,605.71,8.19,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is part of CLEF and focuses on cross-language and languageindependent annotation and retrieval of images. ImageCLEF has been organized since 2003. Four tasks were offered in 2012:</p><p>-medGIFT (University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland, Switzerland); -MIRACL (Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Sfax, Tunisia)*; -MRIM (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, France); -ReDCAD (National School of Engineering of Sfax, Tunisia)*; -UESTC (University of Electronic Science and Technology, China); -UNED-UV (Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia and Universitat de València, Spain);</p><p>Participants marked with a star had not participated in the medical retrieval task in 2011. A total of 202 valid runs were submitted, 43 of which were submitted for modality detection, 122 for the image-based topics and 37 for the case-based topics. The number of runs per group was limited to ten per subtask and casebased and image-based topics were seen as separate subtasks in this view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Datasets</head><p>In ImageCLEFmed 2012, a larger database than 2011 was provided using the same types of images and the same journals. The database contains over 300,000 images of 75'000 articles of the biomedical open access literature that allow free redistribution of the data. The ImageCLEF database is a subset of the PubMed Central<ref type="foot" coords="3,167.17,388.43,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> database containing in total over 1.5 million images. PubMedCentral contains all articles in PubMed that are open access but the exact copyright for redistribution varies among the journals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Modality Classification</head><p>Previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,208.93,462.81,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,221.11,462.81,7.75,8.74" target="#b5">6]</ref> have shown that imaging modality is an important information on the image for medical retrieval. In user-studies <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.20,474.76,9.97,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, clinicians have indicated that modality is one of the most important filters that they would like to be able to limit their search by. Many image retrieval websites (Goldminer, Yottalook) allow users to limit the search results to a particular modality <ref type="bibr" coords="3,467.34,510.63,9.97,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Using the modality information, the retrieval results can often be improved significantly <ref type="bibr" coords="3,178.51,534.54,9.97,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>An improved ad-hoc hierarchy with 31 classes in the sections compound or multipane images, diagnostic images and generic biomedical illustrations was created based on the existing data set <ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.15,570.40,14.62,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The following hierarchy was used for the modality classification, more complex than the classes in ImageCLEF 2011.</p><p>The class codes with descriptions are the following ([Class code] Description):</p><p>-  • [GT AB] Tables and forms</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,158.67,119.00,190.30,138.57">• [GP LI] Program listing • [GF IG] Statistical figures, graphs, charts • [GSCR] Screenshots • [GF LO] Flowcharts • [GSY S] System overviews • [GGEN ] Gene sequence • [GGEL] Chromatography, Gel • [GCHE] Chemical structure • [GM AT ] Mathematics, formulae • [GN CP ] Non-clinical photos • [GHDR] Hand-drawn sketches</formula><p>For this hierarchy 1,000 training images and 1,000 test images were provided to the participants. Labels for the training images were known whereas labels for the test images were distributed after the results submission, only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Image-Based Topics</head><p>The image-based retrieval task is the classic medical retrieval task, similar to the tasks organized from 2004 to 2011 where the query targets are single images. Participants were given a set of 22 textual queries (in English, Spanish, French and German) with 1-7 sample images for each query. The queries were classified into textual, mixed and semantic queries, based on the methods that are expected to yield the best results.</p><p>The topics for the image-based retrieval task were based on a selection of queries from search logs of the Goldminer radiology image search system <ref type="bibr" coords="5,462.33,441.17,14.62,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Only queries occurring 10 times or more (about 200 queries) were considered as candidate topics for this task. A radiologist assessed the importance of the candidate topics, resulting in 50 candidate topics that were checked for at least occurring a few times in the database. The resulting 22 queries were then distributed among the participants and example query images were selected from a past collection of ImageCLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="5,276.65,512.90,14.62,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Case-Based Topics</head><p>The case-based retrieval task was first introduced in 2009. This is a more complex task but one that we believe is closer to the clinical workflow. In this task, 30 case descriptions with patient demographics, limited symptoms and test results including imaging studies were provided (but not the final diagnosis). The goal was to retrieve cases including images that a physician would judge as relevant for differential diagnosis. Unlike the ad-hoc task, the unit of retrieval here was a case, not an image. The topics were created form an existing medical case database. Topics included a narrative text and several images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Relevance Judgements</head><p>The relevance judgements were performed with the same on-line system as in 2008-2011 for the image-based topics as well as case-based topics. For the casebased topics, the system displays the article title and several images appearing in the text (currently the first six, but this can be configured). Judges were provided with a protocol for the process with specific details on what should be regarded as relevant versus non-relevant. A ternary judgement scheme was used again, wherein each image in each pool was judged to be "relevant", "partly relevant", or "non-relevant". Images clearly corresponding to all criteria were judged as "relevant", images for which relevance could not be accurately confirmed were marked as "partly relevant" and images for which one or more criteria of the topic were not met were marked as "non-relevant". Judges were instructed in these criteria and results were manually verified during the judgement process. As in previous years, judges were recruited by sending out an email to current and former students at OHSU's (Oregon Health and Science University) Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology. Judges, primarily clinicians, were paid a small stipend for their services. Many topics were judged by two or more judges to explore inter-rater agreements and its effects on the robustness of the rankings of the systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>This section describes the results of ImageCLEF 2012. Runs are ordered based on the tasks (modality classification, image-based and case-based retrieval) and the techniques used (visual, textual, mixed). 17 teams submitted at least one run in 2012, the same number than in 2011.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Modality Classification Results</head><p>The results of the modality classification task are compared using classification accuracy. With a higher number of classes, this task was more complex than in previous years. As seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,282.57,506.83,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the best result were obtained by the IBM Multimedia Analytics <ref type="bibr" coords="6,230.92,518.78,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref> group using visual methods (69.6%). In previous years combining visual and textual methods most often provided the best results. The best run using visual methods had a slightly better accuracy than the best run using mixed methods (66.2%) by the medGIFT group <ref type="bibr" coords="6,399.28,554.65,14.62,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Only a single group submitted text-based results that performed worse than the average of all runs. The best run using textual methods alone obtained a much lower accuracy (41.3%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Techniques Used for Visual Classification</head><p>The IBM Multimedia Analytics team used multiple features extracted from a set of image granularities with Kernel approximation fusion in the best run <ref type="bibr" coords="6,336.49,644.17,14.62,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A variety of image processing techniques were explored by the other participants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>As in previous years, the largest number of runs submitted for the image-based retrieval task. However, in 2012 there were 122 runs in this task, eight less than in 2011. For the case-based retrieval task the number of runs also decreased to 37 (43 in 2011). On the other hand, the number submitted runs at the modality classification task increased to 43 (34 in 2011).</p><p>There are still different situations as to whether visual, textual or combined techniques perform better depending on the task. For the modality classification, a visual run achieved the best accuracy using training data extension. In the case of the image-based retrieval task, multimodal runs obtained best results. Finally, for the case-based retrieval task textual runs obtained the best results.</p><p>In 2011, the Xerox team <ref type="bibr" coords="14,261.91,178.77,15.50,8.74" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that did not participate in 2012 explored the expansion of the training set. This approach achieved the best accuracy for the modality classification task. In 2012, three teams applied expansion of the training set and also obtained good results. This evolution of techniques is a good example of the added value of evaluation campaigns such as ImageCLEF showing the improvements due to specific techniques.</p><p>Many groups explored the same or similar descriptors obtaining often quite differing results. This shows that particularly the tuning of existing techniques and the intelligent combination of results fusion can lead to optimal results. Often, the differences in techniques are quite small and more on intelligent feature combinations might be necessary to reach conclusive results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,151.70,613.66,238.88,8.74;3,140.99,625.47,126.50,8.77;3,158.67,637.23,154.80,9.30"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[COM P ] Compound or multipane images (1 category) -[Dxxx] Diagnostic images: • [DRxx] Radiology (7 categories):</figDesc></figure>
