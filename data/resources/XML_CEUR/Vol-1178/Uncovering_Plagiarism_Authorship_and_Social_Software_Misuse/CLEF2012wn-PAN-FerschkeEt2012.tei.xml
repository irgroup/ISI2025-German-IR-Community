<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>On July 13th, 2012, the English Wikipedia reached its four millionth article 1 . Since the launch in 2001, the growing community around the free online encyclopedia has produced a knowledge base that is unprecedented in its size and coverage, which is not least due to the policy that anyone can edit its content. In contrast to Wikipedia's unsuccessful predecessor, Nupedia, which allowed only experts to contribute in order to maintain a high quality standard, Wikipedia's open policy was the main engine of the project's success. However, as a downside of this approach, there is no traditional editorial board that ensures the information and text quality of the articles. Hence, quality assurance is reduced to the many eyes principle, hoping that many editors with equal rights monitor each other and thus produce a high quality output. While this approach might work on a global level -the overall quality of Wikipedia has found to be on par with the quality of major printed encyclopedias <ref type="bibr" coords="1,326.45,590.86,16.60,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref> -the quality of individual articles on different levels of maturity cannot be ensured this way. Since Wikipedia is work in progress, there needs to be a way to determine the flaws of any given article in order to provide readers with an estimation of the article's quality level and give authors a 1 http://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/07/13/english-wikipediacrosses-4-million-article-milestone/</p></div>

In this paper, we present FlawFinder, a modular system for automatically predicting quality flaws in unseen Wikipedia articles. It competed in the inaugural edition of the Quality Flaw Prediction Task at the PAN Challenge 2012 and achieved the best precision of all systems and the second place in terms of recall and F 1 -score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Task Definition</head><p>As an integral part of Wikipedia's quality assurance process, authors and articles maintainers use cleanup templates to mark articles that do not meet Wikipedia's quality requirements. Adding such a template posts an info message to the article in order to make readers aware of the existing problems. The article is furthermore added to the respective cleanup category in order to foster article maintenance. Anderka et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.97,493.09,11.62,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref> provide a comprehensive breakdown of the cleanup templates in the English Wikipedia.</p><p>In this task of the PAN Challenge, cleanup templates are understood as indicators for quality flaws. Given a sample of articles that have been tagged with a cleanup template t thus marking it with a quality flaw f , it has to be decided whether or not an unseen article suffers from f . The task targets the prediction of ten important quality flaws for which the organizers provide a training and a test corpus. The training corpus consists of 154,116 articles extracted from the English Wikipedia snapshot from January 4th, 2012 <ref type="foot" coords="2,154.69,587.06,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_0">2</ref> which are labeled with the respective quality flaws. The test corpus contains a balanced number of flawed and untagged articles and has a total size of 19,019 documents. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,187.60,612.64,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the flaw definitions as they are stated on the template information pages and lists the numbers of articles for each flaw in the training and the test corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Related Work</head><p>Quality assessment is a complex issue, since information quality (IQ) is a multidimensional concept that cannot be captured by a single, universal model. Many IQ models have been developed to fit the individual needs of different types of data, applications and users. Successful quality assurance is a particularly challenging issue in open, collaborative environments, since regulatory authorities are less pronounced than in conventional work environments and the concept of quality that the individual collaborators have differs greatly across the community.</p><p>From an information scientific perspective, Stvilia et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,382.00,228.98,16.60,8.64" target="#b21">[22]</ref> developed a framework for information quality assessment and measurement that is supposed to serve as a guide for developing information quality measurement models for many different settings. The authors systematically identified 22 information quality dimensions in the categories intrinsic quality, relational and contextual quality, and reputational quality. They furthermore provide metrics for automatically or semi-automatically measuring the quality along nine of the 22 dimensions. In later work <ref type="bibr" coords="3,374.73,300.71,15.27,8.64" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the authors analyzed the organization of information quality assurance work in Wikipedia by analyzing 60 discussion pages in order to identify the types of IQ problems that are most discussed by the community along with related causal factors. Building on this, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.99,336.57,16.60,8.64" target="#b25">[26]</ref> developed a framework for automatic quality assessment based on a set of 28 metrics.</p><p>Yaari et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.25,360.83,16.60,8.64" target="#b26">[27]</ref> performed a user study asking 64 people to assess the quality of five articles from the Hebrew Wikipedia in order to find the criteria which assist users in determining that an article is of high or low quality. Hereby, the authors rely both on the article page and the article revision history. They found 21 criteria, which they divide into measurable criteria, such as article length or number of edits, and non-measurable criteria, such as coverage or writing style. They furthermore analyze the discriminativeness of each criterion for articles rated as high quality and articles of low quality.</p><p>A growing body of work addresses automatic quality assessment in Wikipedia. The majority of these works targets the prediction of community created quality labels that identify good articles (GA) and featured articles (FA) (i.e. very good articles) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,480.72,16.00,8.64" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.76,480.72,12.00,8.64" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.76,480.72,12.00,8.64" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In contrast to other labels, which can be assigned by any user, articles have to be nominated and reviewed in order to obtain GA or FA status. In other works, the WikiProjects article quality grading scheme<ref type="foot" coords="3,309.38,502.97,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">3</ref> has been used as an additional set of gold standard labels <ref type="bibr" coords="3,196.74,516.59,15.98,8.64" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,212.72,516.59,11.99,8.64" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,224.71,516.59,7.99,8.64" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.70,516.59,11.98,8.64" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,244.68,516.59,11.98,8.64" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>The major problem with approaches using these community created quality labels as a gold standard for quality assessment is the small fraction of articles that are marked with these quality tags. As of August 2012, only 0.089% of all articles in the English Wikipedia are marked as featured and 0.39% are marked as good. In turn, the WikiProject quality classification only applies to selected topics and has different assessment criteria depending on the individual WikiProject <ref type="foot" coords="3,326.98,587.00,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_2">4</ref> .</p><p>In order to shed light on the quality and problems of articles not tagged with quality labels, Anderka et al. thus tackle the task from a different direction and use cleanup templates as indicators for quality flaws. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,314.81,624.88,10.58,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, they provide a breakdown of quality flaws in the English Wikipedia, while they evaluate their effectiveness for quality assurance in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,165.52,131.27,11.62,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref> by analyzing the evolution of quality flaw markers over time. Finally, in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,466.48,131.27,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors automatically identify quality flaws by predicting the cleanup templates in unseen articles, which is also the goal of the Quality Flaw Detection task in the PAN challenge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">System Architecture</head><p>FlawFinder has been implemented as a modular and highly flexible system based on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,402.92,229.59,10.58,8.64" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. UIMA enables applications to be decomposed into reusable components which can be freely arranged into processing pipelines. We use Natural Language Processing components from the open-source NLP toolkit DKPro <ref type="foot" coords="4,266.44,263.79,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_3">5</ref> , which provides solutions for many recurring tasks like tokenization or sentence splitting and offers UIMA integration for state-of-the-art NLP components such as the Stanford CoreNLP library. As a runtime environment, FlawFinder uses the DKPro Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="4,268.99,301.32,10.58,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a lightweight framework that allows to combine independent NLP pipelines into one integrated and highly configurable system.</p><p>FlawFinder consists of five components, a corpus reader, a preprocessor, a feature extraction unit, a module for training and classification, and a report writer.</p><p>Rather than reading the provided training data directly, the corpus reader accesses the articles from our own Wikipedia database, since it offers a wider range of meta data such as the article link structure and information about the article revision history. The database has been created from the same Wikipedia data dump as the provided training corpus and the cleanup templates which are supposed to be predicted are removed. Access to the data is achieved using JWPL <ref type="bibr" coords="4,315.55,408.92,15.27,8.64" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a database driven open-source API for accessing Wikipedia, and the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.78,420.87,15.27,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a package that provides easy access to the article revision history. The corpus reader identifies the relevant articles using the page ids that are provided in the training corpus.</p><p>The preprocessor module uses DKPro components for sentence splitting, tokenization, stop word annotation and named entity recognition. Other DKPro components can easily be added to the pipeline. For parsing the MediaWiki markup of the Wikipedia articles, we use the SWEBLE MediaWiki parser <ref type="bibr" coords="4,328.47,492.61,10.79,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,339.26,492.61,7.19,8.64" target="#b6">7]</ref>, which produces an object model of the article structure.</p><p>The feature extraction component has been implemented using ClearTK <ref type="bibr" coords="4,453.11,516.52,15.27,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a UIMA-based framework for developing statistical NLP components. It offers interfaces for creating feature extractors that can be used independently from the utilized machine learning algorithm. This enables to create a highly configurable feature extraction pipeline that does not restrict the downstream components for training and classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Features</head><p>With our feature set, we aim at modeling the aspects of the article that are most likely to indicate the presence or absence of a quality flaw. Overall, we extract 31 feature types which can be subdivided into seven categories described in this section. A systematic overview can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,262.35,131.27,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>Structural Features are supposed to capture basic structural properties and surface features of the Wikipedia articles. We use the SWEBLE parser for parsing the Wiki markup and create a Wikitext Object Model (WOM) representation of the article. From this WOM, we extract all article sections along with their headers. We use the number of sections, the mean length of the section texts and the number of empty sections as features. Furthermore, we extract a plain text representation without Wiki markup from the WOM and calculate the ratio of markup to plain text as a fourth structural feature.</p><p>Reference Features capture aspects regarding the use of citations in the article. There are basically two types of references, footnote style references and bibliography style references. Footnote style references are marked with &lt;ref&gt; . . . &lt;\ref&gt; tags directly within the text and are automatically listed at the bottom of the page <ref type="foot" coords="5,418.11,287.48,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_4">6</ref> . Bibliography style references are manually listed at the end of the article, usually in the References section. They can either be created as manually formatted list items or can be marked with cite or citation tags for automatic reference formatting. First, we check whether manually created bibliography items exist in the References section and how many elements it contains. Then we count the number of all inline references in the article and determine their average number per sentence. Finally, we determine the ratio of the number of all references to the length of the article. Analogously to lists of references, it is possible to define lists of explanatory notes using the {{notelist}} template. It is usually placed in the Notes section and gathers all occurrences of explanatory notes which are defined within the text with efn templates. We extract this information in the same way as the references.</p><p>Network Features reflect the connections of an article within the whole network of Wikipedia articles and to external resources. Since the number of inbound links (i.e. the number of times other articles link to a given article) cannot be determined by parsing the articles in the provided corpora alone, we use the respective information from our JWPL Wikipedia database. When creating a new Wikipedia database from a Wikipedia data dump, JWPL automatically parses the articles using the JWPL Wikitext parser and stores the link information in the database. For each article, we determine the number of wiki-internal inbound links, wiki-internal outbound links and links to resources outside of Wikipedia.</p><p>Named Entity Features capture the number of named entities in the article. We use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,292.13,578.53,16.60,8.64" target="#b10">[11]</ref> using the 3-class model with distributional similarity features <ref type="foot" coords="5,207.10,588.82,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_5">7</ref> for tagging all entities of the types Person, Organization and Location. We use both the overall named entity counts and the average number of named entities per sentence as features.</p><p>Revision-based Features are based on meta data derived from the article revision history. We use the Wikipedia Revision Toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="6,314.17,131.27,16.60,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to determine the number of revisions for each article. Furthermore, we count the number of unique users that edited the page in the past. Since this number also includes anonymous users, which might be counted several times due to changing IP addresses, we additionally determine the number of unique registered users. Finally, we capture the age of the article in days.</p><p>Lexical Features are extracted from the plain article text that we obtain from the WOM. Any Wiki markup is removed with the exception of internal and external links. All links are replaced with a generic EXPLICITLINK label. Furthermore, we perform stopword filtering using the stopword list from the snowball stemmer 8 , which we augmented with punctuation marks. We extract all token-unigram, bigrams and trigrams from each article and disregard any ngrams with a frequency lower than 5 across the corpus. This cutoff value was determined empirically during the parameter optimization run. We found that a value of 5 was optimal for all flaws.</p><p>Other Features include character counts, token counts and sentence counts per article. Furthermore, we measure the discussion activity by means of counting the number of individual discussion topics on the Talk page associated with the article. According to Ferschke et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,208.04,349.89,10.58,8.64" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, we regard each titled section on the Talk page as an individual topic. We refrain from using lexical features from Talk pages, since the Talk page could explicitly discuss the cleanup tags that are supposed to be predicted and would thus lead to biased results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Classification Approach</head><p>We regard the problem of quality flaw prediction as a binary classification task. For each flaw, we create a training set that contains a balanced number of positive and negative instances. We use the untagged articles provided in the training corpus as negative instances and select a random subset of the same size as the set of flawed articles.</p><p>We use two machine learning algorithms from the Mallet machine learning toolkit <ref type="bibr" coords="6,134.77,505.10,15.27,8.64" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a Naive Bayes classifier and C4.5 decision trees. For efficiently training the Naive Bayes classifier, we perform unsupervised discretization of numeric features using equal interval binning as suggested in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,264.94,529.01,15.27,8.64" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, since the algorithm does not cope well with real valued features and the Mallet toolkit is not able to perform feature discretization automatically. The decision trees were trained using adaptive boosting with 100 rounds and were limited to the depth of five due to memory restrictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Evaluation</head><p>We experimentally derived the best configuration for each flaw in a parameter optimization run, which consists of several training iterations on the same reduced training set using different parameters. To this end, we evaluate the performance of both algorithms for each flaw on 10-fold cross validation using 500 positive and 500 negative instances from the training set. We parameterize each run with the number of selected features (between 250 and 1500), the use of a stop-word filter and the frequency cut-off for discarding rare ngrams in order to obtain the best setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Feature Selection</head><p>We use the Information Gain feature selection approach <ref type="bibr" coords="7,359.23,572.75,16.60,8.64" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to rank and prune the feature space. for instance, the best ranked feature is the discussion activity. This suggests that the discussion content might also be informative for identifying this flaw and that the Talk pages should be further exploited for feature extraction. For the flaw Advert, the most discriminative non-lexical features are links pointing to external resources. Taking into account the context of these external links could further improve the classification performance. It has to be noted that the utility scores cannot be directly compared across flaws. They are only significant as indicators for the ranking within a given flaw. Lexical features are most effective for the flaws Advert, Notability and Original Research, while the other flaws only show little performance gain when adding ngrams to the feature sets. This is to be expected, since structural flaws such as Empty Section or Wikify are not expressed by the vocabulary but by the article structure and the markup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Classification Performance</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="8,159.07,457.85,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows a detailed overview of the classification performance on the training and test set. The results on the training set are based on the best configuration obtained in the parameter optimization run. The performance on the test set has been evaluated by the challenge organizers. The submitted results have been produced using models trained on the whole training set. Furthermore, precision-recall diagrams for both training and test set can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,251.81,517.63,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The good performance on the Advert flaw comes surprising, since it initially seemed to be a hard task due to the subjectiveness and subtlety of this flaw. The extracted lexical features are good indicators for the presence of this flaw. On the other hand, the relatively weak performance on Wikify was not expected. The prediction of this flaw particularly suffered from the selection of negative instances in the training set. A solution to this is discussed in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Error Analysis</head><p>We carried out a detailed error analysis for each flaw in order to identify the main types of errors made by the classifier. The numbers of false positive and false negative instances according to the evaluation on the training set can be seen in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,441.14,656.44,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.  The 71 false positives for Advert mostly contain articles about institutions such as universities or government bodies. The descriptions of these institutions resemble the descriptions of companies. However, for companies the same way of writing is more often regarded as advert-style by Wikipedia users than for public institutions. The 94 false negatives are short articles with an average length of 690 tokens. Many of them do not exceed 250 tokens. These articles do not contain enough text to be reliably classified, since the Advert flaw largely relies on lexical features.</p><p>The 200 false positives for the Notability flaw contain a large number of pages about individual persons, organizations, books or movies. Even Wikipedia users have difficulties to judge whether a specific subject qualifies for being included in the encyclopedia. Without world knowledge about the article topic, a reliable judgment cannot be carried out. Furthermore, the notability criteria in Wikipedia are highly disputed in the community and are not interpreted consistently by all users 9 . For a large fraction of the 63 false negatives, the Notability template has been removed in newer revisions without a major change of the content (for example in the article on the Bigfoot Trail 10 or the Hong Kong Gold Coast 11 ). This suggests that the template has been incorrectly assigned to the training article by the Wikipedia users.</p><p>Many of the 158 false positives for the flaw Unreferenced did actually have no references at all or just contained an external links section. This suggests that the classifier correctly identified the problem, but the templates were missing in the article. The 51 false negatives are subject to the same problem. In this case, the Unreferenced 9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletionism_and_inclusionism_in_ Wikipedia 10 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot_Trail&amp;diff= 502614831&amp;oldid=407680228 11 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hong_Kong_Gold_ Coast&amp;diff=502889724&amp;oldid=461337252 template has been used for marking articles that suffer from the Refimprove flaw. For example, in the corpus version of the article "Robert Hartmann", the used template was Unreferenced but it has been changed to the correct Refimprove template in a later version 12 . Similar confusion can be observed in the misclassified instances of the other flaws related to references and citations, such as Original Research, No Footnotes, and Primary Sources. This suggests that the templates should be better defined and consolidated into fewer categories. Other false negative instances for Unreferenced are due to the inline usage of the templates. According to the flaw definition, the template applies to articles that do not have any references. However, when used inline in the form {{Unreferenced|section}}, it only refers to the section it appears in, while the rest of the article may cite references 13 . In order to account for this, each section has to be classified separately instead of the article as a whole.</p><p>According to the instructions provided by the challenge organizers, the Orphan template is to be assigned to any article that "has fewer than three incoming links". Therefore, we use the feature inlinks &lt; 3, which proved to be the most discriminative one for this flaw. However, the template description in Wikipedia states that articles tagged as Orphan have "zero incoming links from other articles" 14 . This discrepancy accounts for most of the false negatives, which have one or two incoming links from other articles. Removing the above mentioned feature and using the inlink counts alone can solve this issue.</p><p>The false positives for the flaw Wikify mainly consist of short articles. Wikification is not an issue commonly addressed in short articles, and it becomes more important as the article grows. The network and surface features used by the classifier consequently do not work well with short articles.</p><p>No regularities could be found for the misclassifications of the flaw Empty section. It is likely that the main reason for misclassification are parsing errors. We found that sections containing mainly structured elements such as tables, infoboxes or expanded templates are particularly hard to cope with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion</head><p>The work by Anderka et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,248.59,506.75,10.58,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, in which the authors analyze the evolution of cleanup templates, is a step towards better understanding collaboratively created cleanup tags and how they are utilized by the community. However, the reliability of these labels still remains to be evaluated. Future work has to address the issue of annotation quality in a controlled annotation study reporting the agreement of the annotators with the community created gold standard. The results of this study will reveal the upper bound for an automatic classification task. Only then will it be possible to draw sound conclusions from analyses based on this data and to put classification results into perspective.</p><p>In this work, we chose a binary classification approach for predicting quality flaw labels. While binary classification is supported by many mature algorithms for which high-performance implementations are readily at hand, it poses the problem of selecting discriminative negative instances. This issue has been critically discussed by Anderka et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="11,156.95,167.13,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Even though we found the classification performance to be good when using a random sample of untagged articles as negative instances, a more sophisticated selection technique might improve the results even more. Since no articles are available that are explicitly tagged as not suffering from a certain flaw, the removal of a flaw marker might indicate that a specific article revision does no longer suffer from the same flaw. Consequently, article revisions that have just lost a specific flaw marker might serve as more discriminative negative instances for training a binary classifier for the flaw.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,192.92,296.24,56.61,8.06;9,374.92,296.24,45.25,8.06"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) (a) Training Set (b) (b) Test Set</figDesc></figure>
