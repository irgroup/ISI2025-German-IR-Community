<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Introduction iCLEF<ref type="foot" coords="1,168.60,504.08,2.81,5.11" target="#foot_0">1</ref> is the interactive track of CLEF started from 2006, an annual evaluation exercise for Multilingual Information Access systems. From year to year iCLEF has changed collections in order to explore user behavior in scenarios where the necessity for cross-language search come more naturally for the average user. The main question is how best to assist users when searching information written in unknown languages, rather than how best an algorithm can find information written in languages different from the query language.</p><p>In iCLEF task the user receive an image (not annotated) from Flickr 2 and the goal is to find the image again from Flickr using flickling 3 , the search engine provided by iCLEF organizers. The user does not know in advance in which languages the image is annotated. Therefore, searching in multiple languages is essential to get optimal results.</p><p>The task is organized as an online game: the more images you find, the higher you will be ranked. In case of ties, the ranking will also depend on precision (number of images found / number of images attempted) and search time spent in finding the images (less time is better).</p><p>The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes our group statistics; Section 3 describes issues regarding cross lingual facilities and about post image search questionnaires. In last Section we summarize our participation in the track and give some conclusions about the experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Log Processing and Characterization of the Search Sessions</head><p>In order to make good use of the raw data provided by the flickling logs, two processing steps were applied. Thus, the flat files were passed through a Python-based script that cleaned up any possible format abnormalities, followed by the actual import in a SQLite database<ref type="foot" coords="2,240.36,337.16,2.81,5.11" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . From this point, statistical research resumed to a series of standard SQL queries.</p><p>For the UAIC group there was a total of 1532 assigned images --from which the 31 existing users found 1236 and gave up on 296 (though only 39 times explicitly)therefore 80.67% of the referred challenges were solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Assigned Images</head><p>A comparison of user performance yields the subsequent graphic: While there are present several over-achievers, the average count points to a much lower value, suggesting that some users merely experimented with the system before abandoning it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Found and Give-Ups Images</head><p>In what concerns found images, the global count adds up to 1236 items. The following situation is obtained via analyzing the group's success rate:   Again, the numbers are pushed up by a few ambitious players, though at least in some intervals an increase in interest can be observed.</p><p>For the UAIC group there were a total of 39 photos effectively given up on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dictionary Adds</head><p>Our users made good use of the personal dictionary feature, with a total of 1349 additions. The underneath figure illustrates specific usage:  No direct connection between usage of this feature and higher scores can be made (in fact the top achievers seem to have rarely used it at all).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Distinct Searches</head><p>During the competition our users launched a number of 6591 distinct searches (counting 5442 unique terms). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Search Duration</head><p>Except for 11 users with average search times of over 30 minutes, the rest of 20 users had closely distributed typical values (figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,319.44,462.64,3.38,8.48" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). From our analysis we noticed how users with lower times frequently requested hints in order to identify the target picture, while users with higher time spans used more variants for searches in different languages and in the end obtained the highest scores. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">User Highlight</head><p>We focus our attention, for this case study, on the 4-th user from the UAIC group. The performances of this user are as follow:</p><p>-132 pictures found; -141 pictures assigned; -662 queries launched from which 294 where cross-lingual queries; -128 adds to the personal dictionary.</p><p>The success ratio of user 4 is 93.61%. We chose this user because he is the winner of the 2-nd CLEF Flickr Challenge 2009. Andrei Zapodeanu has obtained the number 1 top score at the Flickr competition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Other issues</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Usage of Specific Cross-Lingual Refinement Facilities</head><p>For the UAIC group there were a total of 3016 distinct cross-lingual searches during the competition (counting 2714 unique terms) -45.75% of all queries. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">User Questionnaires</head><p>After the search process users received two questionnaires: one is presented after each search session (in two forms: one if the search failed and another one if the search succeeded), and another one is presented only once at the end, when the user has performed all search sessions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Post-Session Questionnaires</head><p>The statistics of post-session questionnaires are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,404.52,485.20,9.35,8.48">11</ref> (after success search) and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,216.24,496.00,9.35,8.48" target="#fig_0">12</ref> (after failed search). In case of success, the task is perceived as easy in 298 cases, and hard in 1171 cases. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>Seemingly, no clear connection between the results of the over-achieving users and their particular actions can be traced. As we mentioned before, at least no correlation exists between the number of dictionary adds and the success rate. Even so, one previously unexplored subject remained, namely social networking between the partici-pants, how they perhaps exchanged solution ideas. In order to verify this, we focused on the top four participatns, that is to say number users 3, 4, 6 and 23. What we wanted to find out was how many times exactly the same search terms were used by multiple players. Restricting the count to groups of words searched at least twice by at least two distinct users from the four specified above, we obtained a value of 198. Further increasing the limits to a minimum of three search occurrences by no less than three users from the previously enumerated ones, we got a value of 67.</p><p>The corresponding amounts for the rest of the population were 292 and 114. Thus by this criterion 40.4% respectively 37.01% of these overlapping searches belong to the over-achieving users, who represent only 12.9% of the entire UAIC group, evidence pointing towards a possible, though limited, collaboration.</p><p>Even so it is quite unlikely that this factor proved decisive in the long run, ultimately the users' language skills tilting the balance.</p><p>In this paper we tried to show the performances of our group by calculating and creating different reports on each category of the Flicking competition (number of images found vs. number of images assigened, succes rate, the answers given by our users to the specific forms etc.). Also in section 2.6 we presented the statistics of the winner of the competition, Andrei Zapodeanu, member of the UAIC group.</p><p>For any other information, such as the complete list of queries, the toolkit used, or any other thing related to this paper, please contact us by e-mail.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,243.84,611.79,123.77,7.70;2,143.04,451.68,324.96,158.28"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Assigned Images per User</figDesc><graphic coords="2,143.04,451.68,324.96,158.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
