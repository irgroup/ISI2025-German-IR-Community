<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We describe evaluation experiments conducted by submitting retrieval runs for the monolingual German, French, English and Persian (Farsi) information retrieval tasks of the Ad Hoc Track of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2009. In the ad hoc retrieval tasks, the system was given 50 natural language queries, and the goal was to find all of the relevant records or documents (with high precision) in a particular document set. We conducted diagnostic experiments with different techniques for matching word variations, comparing the performance on the robust Generalized Success@10 measure and the non-robust Mean Average Precision measure. The measures generally agreed on the mean benefits of morphological techniques such as decompounding and stemming, but generally disagreed on the blind feedback technique. Also, for each language, we submitted a sample of the first 10000 retrieved items to investigate the frequency of relevant items at deeper ranks than the official judging depth of 60 for German, French and English and 80 for Persian. The results suggest that, on average, the percentage of relevant items assessed was less than 62% for German, 27% for French, 35% for English and 22% for Persian.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Open Text eDOCS SearchServer TM is a toolkit for developing enterprise search and retrieval applications. The eDOCS SearchServer kernel is also embedded in various components of the Open Text eDOCS Suite The eDOCS SearchServer kernel works in Unicode internally <ref type="bibr" coords="2,383.14,228.24,10.51,10.46" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and supports most of the world's major character sets and languages. The major conferences in text retrieval experimentation (CLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="2,154.08,252.14,9.96,10.46" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, NTCIR <ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.76,252.14,10.51,10.46" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and TREC <ref type="bibr" coords="2,274.08,252.14,10.79,10.46" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) have provided judged test collections for objective experimentation with the SearchServer kernel in more than a dozen languages.</p><p>This paper describes experimental work with SearchServer (experimental post-6.0 versions) for the task of finding relevant documents for natural language queries in various European languages using the CLEF 2009 Ad Hoc Track test collections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Data</head><p>The CLEF 2009 Ad Hoc Track document sets were the same as used in 2008. They consisted of XML-tagged records or documents in 4 different languages: German, French, English and Persian (also known as Farsi). For German, French and English, the records were library catalog cards (bibliographic records describing publications archived by The European Library (TEL)). For Persian, the documents were newspaper articles (Hamshahri corpus of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.99,422.93,18.11,10.46">[1996]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.10,422.93,4.53,10.46">[1997]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.10,422.93,4.53,10.46">[1998]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.10,422.93,4.53,10.46">[1999]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.10,422.93,4.53,10.46">[2000]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.10,422.93,4.53,10.46">[2001]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.62,422.93,22.64,10.46">[2002]</ref>. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,483.41,422.93,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> gives the collection sizes.</p><p>The CLEF organizers created 50 natural language "topics" (numbered 701-750 for German, French and English and 601-650 for Persian) and translated them into many languages. Sometimes topics are discarded for some languages because of a lack of relevant documents (though that did not happen this year). Table <ref type="table" coords="2,216.57,482.71,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref> gives the final number of topics for each language and their average number of relevant documents (along with the lowest and highest number of relevant documents of any topic). For more information on the CLEF test collections, please see the track overview paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Indexing</head><p>Our indexing approach was the same as last year <ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.97,564.84,14.61,10.46" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Accents were not indexed. The apostrophe was treated as a word separator (except in English). The custom text reader, cTREC, enforced the CLEF guidelines by only marking specifically tagged fields for indexing.</p><p>For some experiments, some stop words were excluded from indexing (e.g. words like "the", "by" and "of" in English). For our Persian experiments, our stop word list was based on Savoy's list <ref type="bibr" coords="2,106.65,624.62,9.96,10.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>By default, the SearchServer index supports both exact matching (after some Unicode-based normalizations, such as decompositions and conversion to upper-case) and morphological matching (e.g. inflections, derivations and compounds, depending on the linguistic component used).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Searching</head><p>We experimented with the SearchServer CONTAINS predicate. Our test application specified SearchSQL to perform a Boolean-OR of the query words. For example, for German topic 701 whose Title was "Tiere in der Arktis" (Arctic Animals) a corresponding SearchSQL query would be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,90.00,122.49,261.47,46.33">SELECT RELEVANCE('2:3') AS REL, DOCNO FROM CLEF09DE WHERE FT_TEXT CONTAINS 'Tiere'|'in'|'der'|'Arktis' ORDER BY REL DESC;</formula><p>Most aspects of the SearchServer relevance value calculation are the same as described last year <ref type="bibr" coords="3,90.00,206.18,14.61,10.46" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Briefly, SearchServer dampens the term frequency and adjusts for document length in a manner similar to Okapi <ref type="bibr" coords="3,176.89,218.13,10.51,10.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and dampens the inverse document frequency using an approximation of the logarithm. These calculations are based on the stems of the terms (roughly speaking) when doing morphological searching (i.e. when SET TERM_GENERATOR 'word!ftelp/inflect/decompound' was previously specified). The SearchServer RELEVANCE_METHOD setting was set to '2:3' and RELEVANCE_DLEN_IMP was set to 500 for all experiments in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Diagnostic Runs</head><p>For the diagnostic runs listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,267.34,312.23,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the run names consist of a language code ("DE" for German, "EN" for English, "FA" for Persian, and "FR" for French) followed by one of the following labels:</p><p>• "none": No linguistic variations from stemming were matched. Just the surface forms were searched on (after case-normalization).</p><p>• "lexstem" (German, French and English only): Same as "none" except that linguistic variations from stemming were matched. The lexicon-based inflectional stemmer in SearchServer was used. For German, this stemmer includes decompounding.</p><p>• "algstem": Same as "lexstem" except that an algorithmic stemmer was used. For Persian, our stemmer was ported from Savoy's <ref type="bibr" coords="3,262.42,445.73,9.96,10.46" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. For German, French and English, Porter's algorithmic "Snowball" stemmers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,209.11,457.68,10.51,10.46" target="#b5">[6]</ref> were used (for English, the Porter2 version was used).</p><p>• "lexall" (German, French and English only): Same as "lexstem" except that a separate index was used which did not stop any words from being indexed.</p><p>• "algall" (Persian only): Same as "algstem" except that a separate index was used which did not stop any words from being indexed.</p><p>• "4gram": The run used a different index which primarily consisted of the 4-grams of terms, e.g. the word 'search' would produce index terms of 'sear', 'earc' and 'arch'. No stemming or word stopping was done; searching used the IS_ABOUT predicate (instead of the CON-TAINS predicate) with morphological options disabled to search for the 4-grams of the query terms.</p><p>Note that all diagnostic runs just used the Title field of the topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Retrieval Measures</head><p>Traditionally, different retrieval measures have been used for "ad hoc" tasks, which seek relevant items for a topic, than for "known-item" tasks, which seek a particular known document. However, we argue that the known-item measures are not only applicable to ad hoc tasks, but that they are often preferable. For many ad hoc tasks, e.g. finding answer documents for questions, just one relevant item is needed. Also, the traditional ad hoc measures encourage retrieval of duplicate relevant documents, which does not correspond to user benefit. The traditional known-item measures are very coarse, e.g. Success@10 is 1 or 0 for each topic, while reciprocal rank cannot produce a value between 1.0 and 0.5. In 2005, we began investigating a new measure, Generalized Success@10 (GenS@10 or GS10) (introduced as "First Relevant Score" (FRS) in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,134.36,122.49,14.76,10.46" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), which is defined below. This investigation led to the discovery that the blind feedback technique (a commonly used technique at CLEF, NTCIR and TREC, but not known to be popular in real systems) had the downside of pushing down the first relevant item (on average), as has now been verified not just for our own blind feedback approach, but for the 7 blind feedback systems of the 2003 RIA Workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="4,310.31,170.31,15.49,10.46" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and for the Neuchâtel system using French data from CLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="4,166.76,182.26,9.96,10.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,184.98,182.26,10.51,10.46" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provides a theoretical explanation for why positive feedback approaches are detrimental to the rank of the first relevant item.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Primary Recall Measures</head><p>"Primary recall" is retrieval of the first relevant item for a topic. Primary recall measures include the following:</p><p>• Generalized Success@30 (GenS@30 or GS30): For a topic, GS30 is 1.024 1-r where r is the rank of the first row for which a desired page is found, or zero if a desired page was not found.</p><p>• Generalized Success@10 (GenS@10 or GS10): For a topic, GS10 is 1.08 1-r where r is the rank of the first row for which a desired page is found, or zero if a desired page was not found.</p><p>• Success@n (S@n): For a topic, Success@n is 1 if a desired page is found in the first n rows, 0 otherwise. This paper lists Success@1 (S1) and Success@10 (S10) for all runs.</p><p>• Reciprocal Rank (RR): For a topic, RR is 1 r where r is the rank of the first row for which a desired page is found, or zero if a desired page was not found. "Mean Reciprocal Rank" (MRR) is the mean of the reciprocal ranks over all the topics. Interpretation of Generalized Success@n: GS30 and GS10 are estimates of the percentage of potential result list reading the system saved the user to get to the first relevant item, assuming that users are less and less likely to continue reading as they get deeper into the result list.</p><p>Comparison of GS10 and Reciprocal Rank : Both GS10 and RR are 1.0 if a desired page is found at rank 1. At rank 2, GS10 is just 7 points lower (0.93), whereas RR is 50 points lower (0.50). At rank 3, GS10 is another 7 points lower (0.86), whereas RR is 17 points lower (0.33). At rank 10, GS10 is 0.50, whereas RR is 0.10. GS10 is greater than RR for ranks 2 to 52 and lower for ranks 53 and beyond.</p><p>Connection of GS10 to Success@10 : GS10 is considered a generalization of Success@10 because it rounds to 1 for r≤10 and to 0 for r&gt;10. (Similarly, GS30 is considered a generalization of Success@30 because it rounds to 1 for r≤30 and to 0 for r&gt;30.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Secondary Recall Measures</head><p>"Secondary recall" is retrieval of the additional relevant items for a topic (after the first one). Secondary recall measures place most of their weight on these additional relevant items.</p><p>• Precision@n: For a topic, "precision" is the percentage of retrieved documents which are relevant. "Precision@n" is the precision after n documents have been retrieved. This paper lists Precision@10 (P10) for all runs.</p><p>• Average Precision (AP): For a topic, AP is the average of the precision after each relevant document is retrieved (using zero as the precision for relevant documents which are not retrieved). By convention, AP is based on the first 1000 retrieved documents for the topic.</p><p>The score ranges from 0.0 (no relevant documents found) to 1.0 (all relevant documents found at the top of the list). "Mean Average Precision" (MAP) is the mean of the average precision scores over all of the topics (i.e. all topics are weighted equally).</p><p>• Geometric MAP (GMAP): GMAP (introduced in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,335.19,154.37,15.49,10.46" target="#b18">[19]</ref>) is based on "Log Average Precision" which for a topic is the natural log of the max of 0.00001 and the average precision. GMAP is the exponential of the mean log average precision. (We argue in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,410.69,178.28,15.49,10.46" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that primary recall measures better reflect robustness than GMAP.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Statistical Significance Tables</head><p>For tables comparing 2 diagnostic runs (such as Table <ref type="table" coords="5,328.99,236.51,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_2">3</ref>), the columns are as follows:</p><p>• "Expt" specifies the experiment. The language code is given, followed by the labels of the 2 runs being compared. (We abbreviate "lexstem" to "lex", "algstem" to "alg", "4gram" to "4gr" and "lexall" and "algall" to "all".) The difference is the first run minus the second run. For example, "DE-lex-none" specifies the difference of subtracting the scores of the German 'none' run from the German 'lexstem' run (of Table <ref type="table" coords="5,344.22,304.26,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>• "∆GS10" is the difference of the mean GS10 scores of the two runs being compared (and "∆MAP" is the difference of the mean average precision scores).</p><p>• "95% Conf" is an approximate 95% confidence interval for the difference (calculated from plus/minus twice the standard error of the mean difference). If zero is not in the interval, the result is "statistically significant" (at the 5% level), i.e. the feature is unlikely to be of neutral impact (on average), though if the average difference is small (e.g. &lt;0.020) it may still be too minor to be considered "significant" in the magnitude sense.</p><p>• "vs." is the number of topics on which the first run scored higher, lower and tied (respectively) compared to the second run. These numbers should always add to the number of topics.</p><p>• "3 Extreme Diffs (Topic)" lists 3 of the individual topic differences, each followed by the topic number in brackets. The first difference is the largest one of any topic (based on the absolute value). The third difference is the largest difference in the other direction (so the first and third differences give the range of differences observed in this experiment). The middle difference is the largest of the remaining differences (based on the absolute value).</p><p>3 Results of Morphological Experiments</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Impact of Stemming</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,117.47,578.66,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the impact of stemming for the 4 languages. For instance, it shows that the mean increase in GenS@10 was statistically significant for German, and the mean increases in MAP were statistically significant for all 4 languages. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,133.95,614.52,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_2">3</ref> also shows that there were large impacts from stemming on particular topics for German, French and English in both the GenS@10 and MAP measures (we look at some examples in the later sections).</p><p>Like last year, for Persian, even on individual topics there was relatively little impact from stemming. We notice in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,225.00,662.34,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_1">2</ref> that the Success@10 rate was relatively high for Persian (50 out of 50) even without stemming, and that relevant documents were plentiful (89 per topic on average as per Table <ref type="table" coords="5,146.41,686.25,3.87,10.46" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), but we have not done sufficient analysis to understand why the stemming impact was so minor across Persian topics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lexical vs. Algorithmic Stemming</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,117.47,287.81,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_3">4</ref> isolates the differences between the lexical and algorithmic stemmers for the 3 languages for which both types of stemmers were available. For each language, each stemmer outscored the other on at least some individual topics. The higher mean scores of lexical stemming for German were statistically significant in both the GenS@10 and MAP measures.</p><p>German is a language with frequent compound words, and the lexical stemmer included decompounding, unlike the algorithmic stemmer. For example, in German topic 738 (Naturkundemuseen (Natural History Museums)) the run using lexical stemming and decompounding matched passages in relevant records such as 'Naturhistorisches Museum' and 'Naturhistorischen Museums' that were missed by the algorithmic stemmer. The algorithmic stemmer also missed the variant of 'Naturkundemuseum' which was common in relevant records.</p><p>Unfortunately, we haven't had time to walk through more of the stemming differences, but in the past we found a lot of them were from the lexical stemmers just matching inflections while the algorithmic stemmers often additionally match derivations <ref type="bibr" coords="7,365.25,431.27,14.61,10.46" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Impact of Stop Words</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,116.34,477.55,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the impact of using stop words for the 4 languages. Occasionally we see a surprisingly large impact from using stop words on individual topics. For example, for French topic 704 (Bienfaits sociaux du sport (Social Benefits of Sport)) the relevant record found at rank 1 by the base run (oai:bnf.fr:catalogue/ark:/12148/cb37099470n/description) fell to rank 11 when the noise word "du" was not stopped, partly because it did not contain the word "du" (or any linguistic variant of "du"). While "du" had less weight than the other query terms from a lower inverse document frequency (idf), the term occurred only in 217,669 of the 1,000,100 records, and so it apparently still had enough weight to influence the results.</p><p>While the mean impact of stopping tended to be small, the mean increases in MAP were statistically significant in French and German.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Comparison to 4-grams</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,116.48,631.42,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_5">6</ref> compares the 4-gram results to stemming results for all 4 languages. (The 4-gram index did not stop any words from being indexed, so the comparison is to the stemming runs which likewise did not use stop words.) While most of the mean differences were not statistically significant, there were a lot of large differences on individual topics.</p><p>For example, in German topic 739 (Ozonabbau (Ozone Depletion)), the lexical stemming run substantially outscored the 4-gram run in the GenS@10 measure. The stemmer produced stems of 'ozon' and 'abbau', with 'ozon' getting a little higher weight from inverse document frequency. The relevant records typically just used the 'ozon' stem, and relevant records were retrieved as high as rank 3. While the 4-gram approach also produced the 4-character 'ozon' as a search term, its matches were filled with records with surnames containing 'nabbau' which had three times the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Submitted Runs</head><p>For each language, we submitted 4 experimental runs in June 2009 for official assessment. In the identifiers (e.g. "otFA09tdz"), 't' and 'd' indicate that the Title and Description field of the topic were used (respectively), and 'e' indicates that query expansion from blind feedback on the first 3 rows was used (weight of one-half on the original query, and one-sixth each on the 3 expanded rows). The 'z' code indicates that special sampling was done, as described below. From the Description field for German, French and English, instruction words such as "find", "relevant" and "document" were automatically removed (based on looking at some older topic lists, not this year's topics; this step was skipped for Persian as we didn't have time to update our lists this year). Details of the submitted approaches:</p><p>• "t": Just the Title field of the topic was used. Same as the "lexstem" run of Section 2.4 for German, French and English, and same as the "algstem" run of Section 2.4 for Persian.</p><p>• "td": Same as "t" except that the Description field of the topic was additionally used.</p><p>• "tde": Same as "td" except that blind feedback (based on the first 3 rows of the "td" query) was used to expand the query.</p><p>• "tdz": Depth-10000 sampling run based on the "td" run as described below.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="8,132.33,744.16,4.98,10.46" target="#tab_6">7</ref> lists the mean scores for the submitted runs. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Depth-10000 Sampling</head><p>The submitted tdz run for each language was actually a depth probe run from sampling the td run for the language. The base td run was retrieved to depth 10000 for each topic. The first 100 rows of the submitted tdz run contained the following rows of the base run in the following order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="10,95.23,369.51,156.88,22.41">1, 2,<label>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30</label></formula><p>, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 15, 25, ..., 95, 150, 250, ..., 950, 1500, 2500, ..., 9500, 125, 175, ..., 975, 1250, 1750, ..., 9750.</p><p>The remainder of the sample run was padded with the top-ranked remaining rows from the base run until 1000 rows had been retrieved (i.e. rows 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, ..., 962 of the base run).</p><p>This ordering (e.g. the placement of the sample from depth 10000 before the sample from depth 15) was chosen because of uncertainty of how deep the judging would be. As long as the top-37 were judged for each topic, we would have sampling to depth 10000 (because in the above list, you can count that after 37 samples that depth 10000 is reached). The extra sample points, if judged, would just improve the accuracy (because they are just additional sample points from the top 10000, not deeper sample points).</p><p>Our sample run (i.e. the tdz run) for each language was submitted to the CLEF organizers for assessing in June 2009. We assigned it highest judging precedence of all our submitted runs.</p><p>When we received the relevance judgments and analyzed them in August 2009, we checked the judging depth of our sample runs. We found that the top-60 rows were judged for each topic for each German, French and English, and the top-80 rows were judged for each topic for Persian.</p><p>Tables 10, 11, 12 and 13 show the results of the sampling for each language. The columns are as follows:</p><p>• "Depth Range": The range of depths being sampled. The 11 depth ranges cover from 1 to 10000.</p><p>• "Samples": The depths of the sample points from the depth range. The samples are always uniformly spaced. They always end at the last point of the depth range. The total number of sample points (over the 11 rows of the table) adds to 60 for German, French and English and adds to 80 for Persian. • "# Rel": The number of each type of item retrieved from the sample points over the 50 topics. The item type codes are R (relevant), N (non-relevant) and U (unjudged, of which there are always 0). An X is used when a sample point was not submitted because fewer than 10000 rows were retrieved for the topic (which just happened for a few topics). The sum of the item type counts is always 50 times the number of sample points for the depth range (because there are 50 topics for each language).</p><p>• "Precision": Estimated precision of the depth range (R/(R+N+U+X)).</p><p>• "Wgt": The weight of each sample point. The weight is equal to the difference in ranks between sample points, i.e. each sample point can be thought of as representing this number of rows, which is itself plus the preceding unsampled rows.</p><p>• "EstRel/Topic": Estimated number of relevant items retrieved per topic for this depth range. This is the Precision multiplied by the size of the depth range. Or equivalently, it is (R * Wgt) / 50.</p><p>Because each sample point is at the deep end of the range of rows it represents, the sampling should tend to underestimate precision for each depth range (assuming that precision tends to fall with depth, which appears to be the case for all 4 languages).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="11,132.85,732.21,9.96,10.46" target="#tab_13">14</ref> shows the sums of the estimated number of relevant items per topic over all depth ranges in its first row (i.e. it is the sum of the EstRel/Topic entries in the last column of the  <ref type="table" coords="13,234.86,218.21,8.54,10.46" target="#tab_9">10</ref><ref type="table" coords="13,243.40,218.21,4.27,10.46" target="#tab_10">11</ref><ref type="table" coords="13,243.40,218.21,4.27,10.46" target="#tab_11">12</ref><ref type="table" coords="13,247.67,218.21,8.54,10.46" target="#tab_12">13</ref>). The official number of relevant items per topic for each language is listed in the second row. The final row of the table just divides the official number of relevant items by the estimated number in the first 10000 retrieved (e.g. for German, 31.2/50.2=62%). This number should tend to be an overestimate of the percentage of all relevant items that are judged (on average per topic) because there may be relevant items that were not matched by the query in the first 10000 rows. However, the sampling was very coarse at the deeper ranks, e.g. for French, 1 relevant item out of 200 samples in the 6001-10000 range led to an estimate of 20 relevant items per topic in this range. If the sampling had turned up 0 or 2 relevant items, a minor difference, the estimate would have been 0 or 40 relevant items per topic in this range, leading to a substantially different sum (118.5 or 158.5 instead of 138.5). We should compute confidence intervals for these estimates, but have not yet done so. Also, there is a lot of variance across topics, which we have not yet analyzed.</p><p>These preliminary estimates of judging coverage for the CLEF 2009 collections are similar to last year's estimates <ref type="bibr" coords="13,181.02,385.59,15.49,10.46" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for two of the four languages (62% for German this year, 55% last year; 22% for Persian this year, 25% last year). For the other two languages this year's estimates are substantially lower than last year's (27% for French this year, 52% last year; 35% for English this year, 53% last year). We've used similar methodology (though sometimes using different sampling depths) for other past collections, such as the CLEF 2007 Ad Hoc collections (55% for Czech, 69% for Bulgarian, 83% for Hungarian) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,293.29,445.37,14.61,10.46" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the NTCIR-7 ACLIA IR4QA collections (65% for Simplified Chinese, 32% for Traditional Chinese, 41% for Japanese) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,404.93,457.32,14.61,10.46" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the NTCIR-6 CLIR collections (58% for Chinese, 78% for Japanese, 100% for Korean) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,377.94,469.28,14.61,10.46" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and the TREC 2006 Legal and Terabyte collections (18% for TREC Legal and 36% for TREC Terabyte) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,432.27,481.24,14.61,10.46" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>On older TREC collections of approximately 500,000 documents which used depth-100 pooling, <ref type="bibr" coords="13,90.00,505.15,15.49,10.46" target="#b19">[20]</ref> reported that "it is likely that at best 50%-70% of the relevant documents have been found; most of these unjudged relevant documents are for the 10 or so queries that already have the most known answers."

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We described evaluation experiments conducted by submitting retrieval runs for the monolingual German, French, English and Persian (Farsi) information retrieval tasks of the Ad Hoc Track of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2009. We conducted diagnostic experiments with different techniques for matching word variations, comparing the performance on the robust Generalized Success@10 measure and the non-robust Mean Average Precision measure. The measures generally agreed on the mean benefits of morphological techniques such as decompounding and stemming, but generally disagreed on the blind feedback technique. Also, for each language, we submitted a sample of the first 10000 retrieved items to investigate the frequency of relevant items at deeper ranks than the official judging depth of 60 for German, French and English and 80 for Persian. The results suggest that, on average, the percentage of relevant items assessed was less than 62% for German, 27% for French, 35% for English and 22% for Persian. We analyzed a few individual topics for which the different retrieval techniques produced large differences in the scores and found that the judgments were sufficient to gain insight into the reasons for the differences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="1,198.05,698.38,7.23,11.53"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>1 .
