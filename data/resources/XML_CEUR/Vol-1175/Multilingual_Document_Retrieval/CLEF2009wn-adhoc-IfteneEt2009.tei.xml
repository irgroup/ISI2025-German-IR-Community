<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The aim of the 2009 Ad Hoc 1 track was to improve the last year's experience, with the same three tasks: Tel@CLEF, Persian@CLEF, and Robust-WSD. The general aim of the task was to create good reusable test collections for each of them. The main task offers monolingual and cross-language search on library catalog records in English, French, and German, organized in collaboration with The European Library (TEL 2 ) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,143.28,527.08,73.07,8.48" target="#b0">(Agirre et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In 2009, TEL@CLEF evaluated retrieval algorithms on multilingual collections of catalog records. As in 2008, the collections were derived from the English, French and German archives of The European Library. The task is to search and retrieve relevant items from collections of library catalog cards.</p><p>Data from this year was very different from the news corpora previously used in the CLEF ad hoc track, consisting of bibliographic data (document surrogates). Whereas in the traditional ad hoc task, the user searches for document containing information of interest, here the user will be searching to identify which publications are of potential interest -according to the information provided by the catalog card. The question the user is asking is "Is the publication described by the bibliographic record relevant to my information need?".</p><p>Three target collections were provided: TEL Catalog records in English (Copyright British Library (BL)), TEL Catalog records in French (Copyright Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)), and TEL Catalog records in German (Copyright Austrian National Library (ONB)). All three collections are to some extent multilingual and contain documents (catalog records) in many additional languages.</p><p>The way in which we built the system for TEL track and it components are presented in Section 2, while Section 3 presents the runs submitted details. Last Section presents conclusions regarding our participation in TEL 2009 track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">UAIC System for TEL@CLEF</head><p>Our system performs the following operations: pre-processing, indexing, applying rules, translation and searching. The Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,308.76,331.48,4.67,8.48" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the system architecture. Details about the main system components are presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Pre-processing and Indexing</head><p>Pre-processing step help us in selection of relevant tags from XML files. We used Digester<ref type="foot" coords="3,175.08,203.72,2.81,5.11" target="#foot_0">3</ref> for selecting just the attributes we are interested in (title and subject). We have an xml configure file named "playRules.xml" for Digester, where we put the rules that Digester must respect when we parse the xml files (from the library).</p><p>At this step we use Lucene<ref type="foot" coords="3,257.28,236.00,2.81,5.11" target="#foot_1">4</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="3,263.04,236.32,124.91,8.48" target="#b1">(Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2005)</ref>. We used Lucene in order to index the XML files filtered with Digester and after that to search in this index the relevant documents.</p><p>First we created an object of Document type in Lucene terminology, which will be assigned to each article that we want to index. We considered the fields: "docno", "title" and "subject" and we filled them with the corresponding values for the article that we want to index. Pairs (field, value) represents the terms of the current document. The only condition is that the name has to be a String. Add method for the document will take a Field object type that we build using one of static methods in class Field. In the end, we need to consider an IndexWriter for indexing of the Document.</p><p>The Document class has a get() method that can be used to extract the information that was stored in the index. For example, to get the author from the Document we would code doc.get("author").</p><p>Since we added the article itself as Field.UnStored, attempting to get it will return null. However, since we added the URL of the article to the index, we can get the URL and display it to the user in our result list.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Applying Rules</head><p>At this step, in original query in English we identify for every word the lemma and after that accordingly with the result, we build a new query using the following rules:</p><p>• If there are named entities in the query, these entities will be included in title field and also in the subject field, having, of course, a greater relevance in comparison with other words (we used boost factor 2, instead of default boost factor which is 1); • Else every element of the query is added in the title field, as well as in the subject field; • Also, any element of the query (non-named entity) is searched in the Lemma file and thus obtaining the lemmas corresponding to the word. These lemmas will be included in the Lucene query having a smaller relevance (boost factor 0.75) than the original word.</p><p>In the end, a complex Lucene query is obtained, which is to be sent to the next module (Translation), so that the Lucene query can be translated.</p><p>For example the query will look like: &lt;query&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;10.2452/701-AH&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;lang&gt;en&lt;/lang&gt; &lt;text&gt;subject:document^0.7 subject:documenting^0.7 ((subject:documents subject:species)^2.0) (subject:fauna^2.0 subject:about^2.0 subject:arctic^2.0) (title:arctic title:animals)&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/query&gt; And the result will be: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Translation</head><p>We used the Google Java Language API<ref type="foot" coords="4,299.28,382.88,2.81,5.11" target="#foot_2">5</ref> to perform the translation of Lucene query from English to French and German.</p><p>The Lucene queries were received in an XML document structured as: the root element we have tag query, and the children are id, text (that was the query itself) and the language (en in our case). Every query had an id assigned which helped us keep the track of the way the translation was performed and the final result was generated in the result XML.</p><p>We created a DOM parser to obtain every Lucene query, then we processed it using java.util.regex API for pattern matching with regular expressions, so we could separate the words that needed translation from the ones that don't.</p><p>Finally, after the translation was performed we merged the three queries: the original one, the one in French and the one in German, and created the output file that had basically the same structure. These queries were put in the result.xml file and after that they are sending to the index module.</p><p>An example of translate query looks like: &lt;query&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;10.2452/701-AH&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;text&gt; subject:document^0.7 subject:documenting^0.7 ((subject:documents subject:species)^2.0) (subject:fauna^2.0 subject:about^2.0 subject:arctic^2.0) (title:arctic title:animals) subject:document^0.7 subject:documentation^0.7 ((subject:documents subject:espÃ¨ces)^2.0) (subject:faune^2.0 subject:Ã propos de^2.0 subject:Arctique^2.0) (title:Arctique title:animaux) subject:Dokument^0.7 subject:Dokumenting^0.7 ((subject:Dokuments subject:Arten)^2.0) (subject:Fauna^2.0 subject:Ã¼ber^2.0 subject:Arktis^2.0) (title:Arktis title:Tiere) &lt;/text&gt; &lt;/query&gt;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Searching</head><p>At this part we used again Lucene and we created an IndexSearcher in order to extract relevant information from previous created Lucene index. For searching we considered relevant the following values:</p><p>• Measure of documents relevance to a query, For example when we are looking for "Arctic Animals" with description "Find documents about arctic fauna species" the query will look like: title:arctic animals AND "arctic fauna species" with meaning: search for arctic animals in field title from Lucene index and search for arctic fauna species in field subject which is default searching field in Lucene index.</p><p>As we can see the search will search simultaneously in two fields of the index created: title and subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Submitted Runs</head><p>We submitted three runs with the following characteristics:   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>The presented system has four components: (1) pre-processing and indexing, (2) applying rules, (3) translation and (4) searching. First component after selection of relevant tags with Digester, uses Lucene libraries in order to create a Lucene index. Second component transforms the initial query from natural language to Lucene query and it adds to Lucene query boost factors. Third component translates the Lucene query from English to French and German and obtained a more complex Lucene query with elements in all three languages. The last component searches in Lucene index using Lucene queries and offered like output the system result.</p><p>From three runs submitted the first run was the better.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,219.48,634.23,172.70,7.70"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: UAIC system used in TEL@CLEF 2009</figDesc></figure>
