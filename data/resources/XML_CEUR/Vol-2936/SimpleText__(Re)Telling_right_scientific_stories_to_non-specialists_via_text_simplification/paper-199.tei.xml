<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Scientific literacy is important for people to make right decisions, evaluate the information quality, maintain physiological and mental health, avoid spending money on useless items. However, since scientific publications are difficult for people outside the domain and so they do not read them at all even if they are accessible. Text simplification approaches can remove some of these barriers to use scientific information, thereby promoting the use of objective scientific findings and avoiding that users rely on shallow information in sources prioritizing commercial or political incentives rather than the correctness and informational value. The CLEF 2021 SimpleText workshop addresses the opportunities and challenges of text simplification approaches to improve scientific information access head-on. This year, we run three pilot tasks trying to answer the following questions: (1) What information should be simplified? (2) Which terms should be contextualized by giving a definition and/or application? (3) How to improve the readability of a given short text (e.g. by reducing vocabulary and syntactic complexity) without significant information distortion?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Scientific literacy, including health related questions, is important for people to make right decisions, evaluate the information quality, maintain physiological and mental health, avoid spending money on useless items. For example, the stories the individuals find credible can determine their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the application of social distancing, using dangerous fake medical treatments, or hoarding. Unfortunately, stories in social media are easier for people to understand than the research papers. Scientific texts such as scientific publications can also be difficult to understand for non domain-experts or scientists outside the publication domain. Improving text comprehensibility and its adaptation to different audience remains an unresolved problem. Although, there are some attempts to tackle the issue of text comprehensibility, they are mainly based on readability formulas, which are not convincingly demonstrated the ability to reduce the difficulty of text <ref type="bibr" coords="2,396.70,154.71,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>To put a step forward to automatically reduce understanding difficulty of a text, we propose a new workshop called SimpleText which aims to create a community interested in generating simplified summaries of scientific documents. Thus, the goal of this workshop is to connect researchers from different domains, such as Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Linguistics, Scientific Journalism etc. to work together on automatic popularisation of science.</p><p>Improving text comprehensibility and its adaptation to different audience bring societal, technical, and evaluation challenges. There is a large range of important societal challenges SimpleText is linked to. Open science is one of them. Making the research really open and accessible for everyone implies providing them in a form that can be readable and understandable; referring to the "comprehensibility" of the research results, making science understandable <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.53,290.20,11.35,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Another example of those societal challenges is offering means to develop counter-speech to fake news based on scientific results. SimpleText also tackles technical challenges related to data (passage) selection and summarisation, comprehensibility and readability of texts.</p><p>To face these challenges, SimpleText provides an open forum aiming at answering questions like:</p><p>• What information should be simplified (e.g. in terms document and passage selection and summarisation)? • What kind of background information should be provided (e.g. which terms should be contextualized by giving a definition and/or application)? What information is the most relevant or helpful? • How to improve the readability of a given short text (e.g. by reducing vocabulary and syntactic complexity) without information distortion?</p><p>We will provide data and benchmarks, and address evaluation challenges underlying the technical challenges, including:</p><p>• How to measure text simplification?</p><p>• How to evaluate background information?</p><p>• How to evaluate information selection?</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Data Selection</head><p>People have to manage the constantly growing amount of information. According to several estimates the number of scientific journals is around 30,000, with about two million articles published per year <ref type="bibr" coords="2,172.77,650.14,11.27,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. According to scholarly information platform Dimensions 1 , from January 2020 to October 2020, about 180,000 articles on Covid-19 were published <ref type="bibr" coords="3,413.04,86.97,11.42,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To deal with this data volume, one should have a concise overview, i.e. a summary. People prefer to read a short document instead of a long one. Thus, even single-document summarization is already a step of text simplification. Notice, that the information in a summary designed for a scientist from a specific field should be different from that adapted for general public. Despite recent significant progress in the domains of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), the problem of constructing consistent overview has not yet been solved. Automatic text summarization is one of the popular NLP and information access tasks since a pioneering paper by Luhn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,238.47,195.36,11.28,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Automatic summarization can simplify access to primary scientific documents -the resulting concise text is expected to highlight the most important parts of the document and thus reduces the reader's efforts. Early studies developed automatic summarization methods for scientific and technical documents. Evaluation initiatives in the 2000s such as Document Understanding Conference (DUC) and the Summarization track at the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) have focused primarily on the automatic summarization of news in various contexts and scenarios. Modern methods of automatic summarization are trained and tested on large collections of news <ref type="bibr" coords="3,292.23,290.20,12.69,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or social media texts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,398.12,290.20,11.28,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Scientific articles are typically provided with a short abstract written by the authors. Thus, automatic generation of an abstract for a stand-alone article does not seem to be a practical task. However, if we consider a large collection of scientific articles and citations between them, we can come to a task of producing an abstract that would contain important aspects of a paper from the perspective of the community. Such a task has been offered to the participants of the TAC 2014 Biomedical Summarization Track<ref type="foot" coords="3,187.98,369.74,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , as well as of the CL-SciSumm shared task series. In particular, the 2020 edition of CL-SciSumm features LaySummary subtask, where a participating system must produce a text summary of a scientific paper intended for non-technical audience. <ref type="foot" coords="3,453.80,396.84,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref>Sentence compression can be seen as a middle ground between text simplification and summarization. The task is to remove redundant or less important parts of an input sentence, preserving its grammaticality and original meaning <ref type="bibr" coords="3,322.52,439.25,11.47,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Thus, the main challenge is to choose which information should be included in a simplified text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Comprehensibility</head><p>Readability, comprehensibility and usability are key points of the information evaluation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.27,502.52,11.54,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The most recent works in the text comprehension field show various approaches to explain stages and strategies of text comprehension in children, bilinguals, and adults with reading / learning disabilities. Comprehensibility of a simple text varies for different readership. Readers of popular science texts have a basic background, are able to process logical connections and recognize a novelty <ref type="bibr" coords="3,176.96,570.27,16.09,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In the popular science text, a reader looks for rationalization and clear links between well known and new <ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.09,583.82,16.41,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. To adopt the novelty, readers need to include new concepts into their mental representation of the scientific domain.</p><p>According to The Free Dictionary, background knowledge is "information that is essential to understanding a situation or problem" <ref type="bibr" coords="3,258.78,624.46,19.01,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Lack of basic knowledge can become a barrier to reading comprehension <ref type="bibr" coords="3,194.96,638.01,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,229.97,638.01,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the authors suggested that there is a knowledge threshold allowing reading comprehension. Background knowledge, along with content, style, location, and some other dimension, are useful for personalised learning <ref type="bibr" coords="4,368.98,100.52,16.13,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In contrast to newspapers limited by the size of the page, digital technologies provide essentially unbounded capabilities for hosting primary-source documents and background information. However, in many cases users do not read these additional texts. It also is important to remember, that the goal is to keep the text simple and short, not to make it indefinitely long to discourage potential readers.</p><p>Entity linking (also known as Wikification) is the task of tying named entities from the text to the corresponding knowledge base items. A scientific text enriched with links to Wikipedia or Wikidata can potentially help mitigate the background knowledge problem, as these knowledge bases provide definitions, illustrations, examples, and related entities. However, the existing standard datasets for entity linking such as <ref type="bibr" coords="4,278.04,222.46,17.76,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> are focused primarily on such entities as people, places, and organizations, while a lay reader of a scientific article needs rather assistance with new concepts, methods, etc. Wikification is close to the task of terminology and keyphrase extraction from scientific texts <ref type="bibr" coords="4,227.93,263.11,16.25,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, the main challenge of the comprehensibility is to provide relevant background knowledge to help a reader to understand a complex scientific text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Readability</head><p>Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. It is part of the so called information nutritional label which aims at helping users to analyze information objectively <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,367.03,16.25,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Readability is different from legibility, which measures how easily a reader can distinguish characters from each other. Readability indices have been widely used to evaluate teaching materials, news, and technical documents for about a century <ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.41,407.68,16.47,10.91" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,386.60,407.68,12.35,10.91" target="#b19">19]</ref>. For example, Gunning fog index, introduced in 1944, estimates the number of years in a scholar system required to understand a given text on the first reading.Similarly, the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests shows the difficulty of a text in English based on word length and sentence length <ref type="bibr" coords="4,437.88,448.32,16.42,10.91" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. Although these two metrics are easy to compute, they are criticized for the lack of reliability <ref type="bibr" coords="4,464.68,461.87,16.42,10.91" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. The very structure of the readability indices suggested to authors or editors how to simplify a text: organize shorter and more frequent words into short sentences. Later studies incorporate lexical, syntactic, and discourse-level features to predict text readability <ref type="bibr" coords="4,376.55,502.52,16.25,10.91" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>In NLP tasks, readability, coherence, conciseness, and grammar are usually assessed manually since it is difficult to express these parameters numerically <ref type="bibr" coords="4,349.77,529.62,16.14,10.91" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. However, several studies were carried out in the domain of automatic readability evaluation, including the application of language models <ref type="bibr" coords="4,165.31,556.72,16.30,10.91" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,184.31,556.72,12.50,10.91" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,199.51,556.72,12.50,10.91" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,214.70,556.72,13.95,10.91" target="#b26">26]</ref> and machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="4,378.91,556.72,16.30,10.91" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,397.91,556.72,12.23,10.91" target="#b26">26]</ref>. Traditional methods of readability evaluation are based on familiarity of terms <ref type="bibr" coords="4,361.93,570.27,16.56,10.91" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,382.21,570.27,12.59,10.91" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,398.53,570.27,14.11,10.91" target="#b30">30]</ref> or their length <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.91,570.27,18.07,10.91" target="#b31">[31]</ref> and syntax complexity (e.g. sentence length, the depth of a parse tree, omission of personal verb, rate of prepositional phrases, noun and verb groups etc.) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,387.86,597.37,16.55,10.91" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,408.31,597.37,12.59,10.91" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,424.79,597.37,12.59,10.91" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,441.27,597.37,12.59,10.91" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,457.76,597.37,12.42,10.91" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Word complexity is usually evaluated by experts <ref type="bibr" coords="4,288.54,610.92,16.55,10.91" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,308.51,610.92,12.59,10.91" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,324.52,610.92,12.42,10.91" target="#b30">30]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,346.34,610.92,18.07,10.91" target="#b37">[37]</ref> computed average normalized number of words in valid coherent passages without syntactical errors, unresolved anaphora, and redundant information. Several researches argue also the importance of sentence ordering for text understanding <ref type="bibr" coords="4,192.05,651.56,16.43,10.91" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,211.21,651.56,12.32,10.91" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</p><p>Automatic text simplification might be the next step after estimation of text complexity. Usu-ally, text simplification task is performed and assessed on the level of individual sentences. To reduce the reading complexity, in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,238.82,100.52,16.14,10.91" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, the authors introduced a task of sentence simplification through the use of more accessible vocabulary and sentence structure. They provided a new corpus that aligns English Wikipedia with Simple English Wikipedia and contains simplification operations such as rewording, reordering, insertion and deletion. Accurate lexical choice presupposes unambiguous reference to the particular object leading to actualization of its connections with other objects in the domain. Domain complexity concerns the number of objects and concepts in the domain, and connections among them described by the terminology system (see a survey: <ref type="bibr" coords="5,131.68,195.36,15.53,10.91" target="#b41">[41]</ref>). Names of the objects are not replaceable in the process of text transformation or simplification due to risk of information distortion <ref type="bibr" coords="5,314.36,208.91,16.35,10.91" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,333.43,208.91,12.27,10.91" target="#b43">43]</ref>. For example, 'hydroxychloroquine' represents a derivative of 'chloroquine', so the substances are connected thanks to belonging to a set 'chloroquine derivatives'. However, it is impossible to substitute 'hydroxychloroquine' by 'chloroquine' while simplifying a medical text about a Covid-19 treatment because of the difference in their chemical composition. A hypernym 'drugs' can refer to the substances. The hyperonym generalizes the information while omitting essential difference between the drugs; however, the generalization allows to avoid misinformation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,362.86,290.20,16.41,10.91" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Science text simplification presupposes facilitation of readers' understanding of complex content by establishing links to basic lexicon, avoiding distortion connections among objects within the domain.</p><p>Ideally, the results undergo a human evaluation, since traditional readability indices can be misleading <ref type="bibr" coords="5,154.06,344.40,16.32,10.91" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Automatic evaluation metrics have been proposed for the task: SARI <ref type="bibr" coords="5,488.00,344.40,17.98,10.91" target="#b46">[46]</ref> targets lexical complexity, while SAMSA estimates structural complexity of a sentence <ref type="bibr" coords="5,487.15,357.95,16.41,10.91" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Formality style transfer is a cognate task, where a system rewrites a text in a different style preserving its meaning <ref type="bibr" coords="5,196.10,385.05,16.39,10.91" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. These tasks are frequently evaluated with BLEU metrics <ref type="bibr" coords="5,476.12,385.05,18.04,10.91" target="#b49">[49]</ref> to compare system's output against gold standard.</p><p>Thus, the main challenge of the readability improvement is to reduce vocabulary and syntactic complexity without information distortion while keeping the target genre.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Collection</head><p>For this edition we use the Citation Network Dataset: DBLP+Citation, ACM Citation network <ref type="foot" coords="5,501.11,503.54,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . An elastic search index is provided to participants accessible through a GUI API. This Index is adequate to:</p><p>• apply basic passage retrieval methods based on vector or language IR models; • generate Latent Dirichlet Allocation models; • train Graph Neural Networks for citation recommendation as carried out in StellarGraph <ref type="foot" coords="5,501.78,582.96,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref>for example; • apply deep bi directionnal transformers for query expansion; • and much more . . . One of the important problems in manual text simplification is a cognitive bias called the curse of knowledge, which occurs when an individual assumes that their interlocutor has the background to understand them. To leverage this issue, we simplify text passages issued from computer science articles abstracts by a pair of experts. One annotator is a computer scientist who understands the text and simplifies passages. Then each pair of passages (simplified and not) is reread by a professional translator from the University of Western Brittany Translation Office <ref type="foot" coords="6,115.15,166.51,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> who is an English native speaker but not a specialist in computer science. Each passage is discussed and rewritten multiple times until it becomes clear for non computer scientists. The observation of the obtained simplification examples revealed opposite strategies in making text understandable. On the one hand, shortening passages by eliminating details and generalization seem an efficient strategy. On the other hand, simplified sentences are longer and more concrete, e.g. the sentence from an article on exposing image tampering "The learning classifiers are applied for classification" was simplified as "The machine learning algorithms are applied to detect image manipulation". For a computer scientist, it is evident that the detection problem is a special case of a binary classification task, but in order to make this sentence understandable for a non computer scientist, the abstract term "classification" should be replaced with a concrete use-case "to detect image manipulation". Thus, on the one hand our methodology of passage simplification ensures data quality. On the other hand, it provides interesting insights to simplification strategies.</p><p>Simplification efficacy depends on the subject: how wide is it spread and whether the field it belongs to is sophisticated or well known thanks to the basic level of education? Nevertheless, every subject can be simplified by improving the text readability and providing background information to improve its comprehensibility. Meanwhile, improving the comprehensibility may bring in distortion of the original content. While selecting the materials for queries, we provide various opportunities to work on simplifications. Thirteen queries are associated with a set of demanded topics including global markets and cryptocurrencies, social media regulation, medicine, technologies and ethical problems caused by AI. The extracted keywords are relevant in retrieving resources that provide relevant information, which is of importance for readers to understand the topic. We retrieved sentences from the documents from the Citation Network Dataset using these keywords to work out manual simplification. Our enhancement aims at readability and comprehensibility of the sources.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" coords="6,136.58,506.99,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the instances of our simplification are shown. The third column of the table contains target sentences. The fourth column includes various types of the simplified sentences: a. sentences simplifying original construction; b. sentences generalizing original content; c. sentences providing basic information; d. sentences that are easy to read and to comprehend; e. sentences that provide explanations of terminology.</p><p>The (a) case is shown in the first row, where content of the target sentence with the key word 'misinformation' is simplified through eliminating heavy construction. It also explains the term "confirmation bias". The (b) case is represented in the second row. Simplification of the  target sentence with the keyword 'financial markets' is reached by eliminating the description of the automatized trading on financial markets. The (c) case in the third row shows how content simplification deletes some original content. The simplified sentence expresses basic information instead of comparison of the sensor based control in managing interaction between a robot and its environment over joint positions and velocities. The (d) case is represented by an omission of particular details about JPEG images that does not damage the original content. The simplified sentence about guest and host virtual machines (e) provides an explanation of the terms 'guest' and 'host' enhancing comprehensibility of the target sentence, nevertheless simplification leads to enlarging the text volume.</p><p>57 manually simplified passages were provided to participants for training.</p></div>

Details on the tasks, guideline and call for contributions can be found at www.irit.fr/simpleText, in this paper we just briefly introduce the planed pilot tasks. Note that the pilot tasks are means to help the discussions and to develop a research community around text simplification. Contributions will not exclusively rely on the pilot tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Task 1: Selecting passages to include in a simplified summary -Content Simplification</head><p>Given an article from a major international newspaper general audience, this pilot task aims at retrieving from a large scientific bibliographic database with abstracts, all passages that would be relevant to illustrate this article. Extracted passages should be adequate to be inserted as plain citations in the original paper. Sentence pooling and automatic metrics will be used to evaluate these results. The relevance of the source document will be evaluated as well as potential unresolved anaphora issues.</p><p>Output: A maximum of 1000 passages to be included in a simplified summary in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file with the following fields:</p><p>• run_id: Run ID starting with team_id_;</p><p>• manual: Whether the run is manual 0,1; • topic_id: Topic ID; • doc_id: Source document ID; • passage: Text of the selected passage; • rank: Passage rank. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The paper introduced the CLEF 2021 SimpleText track, consisting of a workshop and pilot tasks on text simplification for scientific information access. As SimpleText is in the intersection of computer science (namely AI, IR and NLP) and linguistics, the collaboration of the researchers from these domains is necessary. The SimpleText workshop relies on an interdisciplinary community of researchers in automatic language processing, information retrieval, linguistics, sociology, science journalism and science popularization working together to try to solve one of the biggest challenges of today. This diversity is reflected by the previewed presentations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,89.29,195.62,104.82,8.93;7,192.22,84.19,208.35,98.87"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Query example</figDesc><graphic coords="7,192.22,84.19,208.35,98.87" type="bitmap" /></figure>
