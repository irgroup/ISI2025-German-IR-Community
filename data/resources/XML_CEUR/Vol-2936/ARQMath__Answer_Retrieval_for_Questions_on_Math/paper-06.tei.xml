<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report on the systems that the Math Information Retrieval group at Masaryk University (mirmu) and the team of Faculty of Informatics students (msm) prepared for task 1 (find answers) of the arqmath lab at the clef conference. We have prototyped ten math-aware information retrieval (mir) systems for the main question-answering task. We ensembled the results of the ten "weak" individual systems into committees and let them vote to provide answers to questions. We evaluated the proposed invidividual systems and ensembles, considering their diversity, hyperparameters, and representations used, and classified their approaches. We have shown the diversity of all systems and evaluated four voting algorithms to collect and rank the answers. Ensembling techniques consistently outperformed the base systems and showed the power of voting of diverse systems. Our prototypes help to understand the challenging problems of question answering in the stem domain and our novel reproducible evaluation framework sets a new direction in mir research. Finally, we formulate ten commandments for future work in the area.</p></div>

This year we concentrated on the program of ten specific research questions and challenges: Q2: diversity of topics How varies different expressions of information needs as questions answered by information systems? How systems handle out-of-distribution questions, and how their performance varies w.r.t. topics?</p><p>Q3: ensembling Could ensembling techniques give consistently better results than individual systems?</p><p>Q4: ensemble voting strategies To which extent could ensembles and query classification benefit from the diversity of individual systems?</p><p>Q5: representation To which extent the query and document representation and indexing of the meaning of formulae influence the system's performance? How to collate the representation of text and formulae together? How to grab and disambiguate the meaning of symbols in the formulae?</p><p>Q6: attention To which extent the new attention-based approaches could be deployed for math question answering? How does it compare to the standard fine-tuned information retrieval approaches, developed for sole text retrieval?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q7: performance</head><p>To what extent are appropriate and valuable the standard information retrieval techniques as query expansion, keyword similarity metrics, or probabilistic approaches as BM25?</p><p>Q8: canonicalization Does the canonical representation of formulae matter in the math question answering task?</p><p>Q9: inference How to integrate the deduction into a math question answering system? Q10: explainability How to provide arguments of answer ranking based on the ensembling algorithm and scoring of individual systems?</p><p>To answer these questions, we collected ten individual math-aware systems for task 1. It was possible due to PV211 Introduction to Information Retrieval course student projects, and due to works of PV174 Seminar of Laboratory of Electronic and Multimedia Applications taught at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University by the last author. Ten available systems, together with ground truth data from ARQMath 2020 evaluation lab gave us means to measure and evaluate their (hyper)parameters, different ensembling techniques, different representations, different data preprocessing techniques, different evaluation measures, different query expansion strategies, different reranking algorithms, and tackle prescribed questions with rigorous research methodology.</p><p>Our main objective was to gain insight into the research problems above and answer some of them. To this end, we submitted five result lists for each mirmu (by PV174 seminar) and msm (by PV211 course) teams.</p><p>We think that the key in solving the challenges lies in the accurate, evidence-based evaluation of available systems, and their parameters, preprocessing and representation of math-aware data and texts. We have compared our ten available systems using both unsupervised and supervised approaches for systems' hyperparameter tuning, representation learning. Finally, we have ensembled our submissions into four committees of mirmu individual systems that have achieved a better result on 2020 data than any of the single ensembled algorithms alone.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Datasets and Methods</head><p>This section will describe the math representations ingested by our information retrieval systems, the corpora used for training the models that power our systems, and the relevance judgments we used for parameter optimization, model selection, and performance estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Math Representations</head><p>There are variety of formats for math formulae representation and ranking <ref type="bibr" coords="3,427.43,452.58,17.96,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> at our fingertips: L A T E X, Presentation MathML (pmml), Content MathML (cmml), Symbol Layout Tree (slt), Operator Tree (opt), <ref type="bibr" coords="3,184.76,479.68,18.03,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> M-Terms, the prefix notation, and the infix notation. For pmml and cmml canonicalized <ref type="bibr" coords="3,179.51,493.23,17.86,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> versions might also be used. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,358.73,493.23,5.04,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows how the individual math representations are derived from L A T E X, which is prevalent author format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">L A T E X</head><p>As the most direct math representation, we used L A T E X, the standard and most frequent authoring format for math. Although L A T E X is easy to type and preferred by authors, it often encodes the presentation aspects of a math formula rather than its content. L A T E X is also a Turing-complete language and, therefore, impossible to parse in the general case statically. As a result, each formula is represented as a single token in the L A T E X representation. L A T E X is helpful as a baseline math representation and as a basis for deriving more fine-grained math representations described in the following sections. Although having each formula represented as a single token may not seem helpful, two of our ten systems (scm and Compubert) model subwords, which allows them to extract symbols out of the formulae.</p><p>To give an example, the formula 𝑥!! -𝑦 2 = 0 would be represented as a single token $x!! -y^2 = 0$ in L A T E X.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Prefix Notation</head><p>To linearize the Operator Tree (opt), <ref type="bibr" coords="4,263.94,149.66,18.06,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> we converted math formulae from opt into the prefix notation. The prefix notation corresponds to the list of visited nodes in the opt in the depth-first-search order, i.e., the topological sorting of the opt. Like L A T E X, the prefix notation is easy to type. Unlike L A T E X, the prefix notation is tokenized into math symbols and independent of a formula's presentation aspects.</p><p>To give an example, the formula 𝑥!! -𝑦 2 = 0 would be represented as the following spaceseparated list of tokens in the prefix notation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,89.29,233.40,416.99,21.45">U!eq O!minus O!double-factorial V!x O!SUP V!y N!2 N!0.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Document Collections</head><p>For training our models, we used the arXMLiv and Math Stack Exchange corpus. Our data preprocessing code is available online.<ref type="foot" coords="4,259.82,305.84,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">ArXMLiv</head><p>The arXMLiv 08.2019 corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="4,222.42,356.74,18.06,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> contains 1,374,539 articles from the arXiv.org open-access archive converted from L A T E X to HTML5 and MathML. We split the corpus into four subsets: no_problem (150,701 articles), warning_1 (500,000 articles), warning_2 (328,127 articles), and error (395,711 articles), according to the severity of errors encountered when converting L A T E X to HTML5. We only used the no_problem, warning_1, and warning_2 subsets (978,828 articles) of the corpus to train our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Math Stack Exchange</head><p>The Math Stack Exchange collection V1.2 (m-se) provided by the organizers of the arqmath 2021 competition contains 2,466,080 posts from the Math Stack Exchange question answering website in HTML5 and L A T E X. Besides the answers <ref type="bibr" coords="4,317.36,500.73,12.54,10.91" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,329.89,500.73,16.72,10.91">445,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,346.61,500.73,16.72,10.91">495)</ref>, which are the retrieval unit in task 1 of arqmath, the posts also contain questions (1,020,585) related to the answers and can be used for learning what a good answer for a question is.</p><p>Posts in the m-se collection contain 28,320,920 math formulae. In arqmath 2020, only 26,075,012 math formulae in pmml (92.07%) and 25,366,913 math formulae in cmml (89.57%) have been successfully converted and provided by the organizers as Formulas v1.0. To improve the conversion success rate, we performed our conversion from L A T E X to 26,705,527 math formulae in cmml (94.30%) and 27,232,230 math formulae in pmml (96.16%). In arqmath 2021, we collaborated with the organizers to provide 28,282,477 math formulae in both pmml and cmml (99.86%) as Formulas v2.0.</p><p>The m-se collection is structured and contains not only the body texts but also the titles, tags, comments, up-and down-votes, view counts, and authorship information, among other things. Although the collection provides a wealth of information, it is difficult to navigate and can cause choice overload for newcomers. To make the development of new systems easier, we simplified the corpus into two OOP classes ArqmathQuestionBase and ArqmathAnswerBase, in our pv211-utils Python library. <ref type="foot" coords="5,222.34,326.84,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We also created a Jupyter Notebook at the Google Colaboratory service<ref type="foot" coords="5,119.95,340.39,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> as a template for quick development of new math information retrieval systems by our students using our pv211-utils library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Queries and Relevance Judgements</head><p>Official arqmath 2020 human-annotated task 1 and 2 relevance judgments produced by eight annotators with the fair agreement (𝜅 = 0.34) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,298.62,418.57,17.98,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> are available. We used the relevance judgments for training, hyperparameter optimization, model selection, and performance estimation in our systems. For 77 topics from task 1, the documents were evaluated with a range from 0 (not relevant) to 3 (highly relevant) as the gain. The relevance judgements are highly imbalanced in favor of non-relevant answers: Out of all 39,124 judgements, there exist as many as 35,051 judgements (89.59%) with gain 0, 2,269 judgements (5.8%) with gain 1, 1,071 judgements (2.74%) with gain 2, and only 733 (1.85%) judgements with gain 3.</p><p>Out of the 39,124 judgements over 77 topics, we produced three primary subsets (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,496.59,513.41,3.56,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Train (55)</head><p>The train subset contains a stratified sample of 55 topics (71.43%) and their associated 27,830 judgements (71.13%). We produced the stratified sample of 55 topics by taking three simple random samples of 19 computation topics, 7 concept topics, and 29 proof topics. To divide the topics into computation, concept, and proof categories, we used the detailed annotations provided by organizers <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.95,590.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for topics of both years. We used the train subset for training supervised models in our systems.</p></div>

In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,318.41,320.14,5.17,10.91">8</ref> on page 16, we show that systems from the six clusters have different strengths and weaknesses: For example, Compubert receives the most consistent results across both text-and math-based topics, excels at short topics, but its performance deteriorates for long topics that don't fit into its context window. By contrast, tf-idf-and BM25-based systems excel at text-based topics, but their performance deteriorates for math-based topics. Systems that model soft matches, such as the scm, can exploit both short and long topics. Our experimental code for figures 7 and 8 is available online. 20, 21, 22  We have implemented, computed, and submitted three ensembling techniques: ibc described in Section 4.2 on page 16, wibc in Section 4.3 on page 17, and rbc in Section 4.4 on page 18. We have also implemented and computed one out-of-competition ensembling technique: rrf described in Section 4.1 on the following page. We have used our techniques to ensemble the result lists of all ten systems of the mirmu and msm teams. In this section, we will describe our ensembling techniques and their results on task 1 of arqmath 2021.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>Motivated by our curiosity to answer our ten research questions, we have introduced ten diverse math-aware information systems. We have data-evidenced using collected systems and available ground truth that good voting strategies of ensembles of baseline systems have the capacity to outperform individual systems.</p><p>From our experiments, we formulate ten commandments for math-aware question answering tasks like ARQMath on Math Stack Exchange: C1: diversity of systems Use as diverse and as many different systems as you can.</p><p>C2: diversity of topics Bear in mind the specificity, diachronicity, context of topics, together with relevance judgements of similar topics. If available, take the seeker history and personality into account to disambiguate the information need.</p><p>C3: ensembling Diversity is powerful. Clever ensembling of different points of view into account is efficient approach to get better findings and decisions.</p><p>C4: ensemble voting strategies Voting strategies are important to weight different aspects of individual systems. It pays off to choose the appropriate ensembling techniques to consistently get better results.</p><p>C5: representation Representation matters. The better semantic metric we could design for text and math formulae, the better capture of the topic and answer meaning, and the better the performance! C6: attention Attention is not all you need, but attention-based models have huge capacity to learn both text and formulae representations and short inferences.</p><p>C7: performance Good system performance is a bonus to speed up the development and fine-tuning. Precompute as much as possible, and make the indexes sorted according the semantics. There is always a space for late optimization.</p><p>C8: canonicalization Give attention to the diversity of language and mathematical notation and use measures of the semantic similarity as much as you can.</p><p>C9: inference To tackle the exponential growth of knowledge, embrace inference into your (deep) models.</p><p>C10: explainability Insight, understanding the whole system and explainability for results matters not only to users for result evidence, but also for fine-tuning and system optimization.</p><p>Setting the tools, computing environment, and datasets are crucial for studying and researching complex information retrieval methods. <ref type="bibr" coords="21,289.19,350.30,16.39,10.91" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Thanks to the open source tools, arqmath competition datasets, and the production environment set at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, ten student systems were prototyped. We were able to set up a framework for evaluation of not only varieties of individual mir systems and approaches, but also of their voting and ensembles. This sets the ground to speed up our understanding of innermost features of mir systems and paves the road to the better fulfilment of information needs of math-aware problem searchers.</p><p>Diversity rulez! Looking at complex problem from diverse viewpoints is a good thing and so is wise compounding and merging diverse approaches and their results!</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,172.08,330.29,4.82"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Dependencies between math representations ingested by our systems.</figDesc></figure>
