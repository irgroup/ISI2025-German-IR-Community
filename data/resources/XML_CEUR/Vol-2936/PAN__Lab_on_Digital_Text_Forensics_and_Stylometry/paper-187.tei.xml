<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This article describes the manner in which we tackle the PAN 2021 Authorship Verification Task. The aim of this task is to build a machine learning model, which will be capable of predicting whether or not two given texts were written by the same author. This task poses more challenges compared with other text classification problems e.g. Author Attribution. While if one seeks to determine if a text was written by one known author or the other, a common strategy would be to train the model to be familiarised with the distinctive writing style of the known author, followed by an attempt to distinguish texts written by unknown authors from that style. However, in Authorship Verification, one must train a model which will be able to differentiate between a subtler set of variances, which either exemplify conscious or unconscious changes in writing style of the same author and possibly greater variances which may indicate styles of different authors. In an attempt to resolve the challenge posed by Authorship Verification, we experiment with various linguistic and linguistically-inspired features that are either intuitive, follow common linguistic practice, or have shown proven success in similar projects. Traditionally speaking, a solution to this problem is used to unveil the identity of otherwise anonymous authors using specific characteristics we call features. These features are derived from textual idiosyncrasies (e.g. grammatical patterns) and stylistic patterns. They can be learned by a model in a way that they are mostly unaffected by the topic or theme of the text, while on the downside, some of them are not linguistically interpretable. We hypothesize that by using an adequate number of features we would be able to train a model capable of distinguishing between authors of different texts to a satisfactory level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Our Approach</head><p>Our strategy consists of the following steps: first, we extract vector-based and scalar features from both texts in a text-pair, followed by calculating distances between the texts. The distance measures we apply are Cosine distance on vector-based features and absolute distance on scalar features. The smaller the distance the more similar the texts are presumed to be, thus inferring they are more likely to be written by the same author. We concatenate all the extracted similarities into a matrix, which is used as input to each of our four regression models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. Finally, we evaluate our model using AUC (area under the curve), F1-score, c@1, F_0.5u and Brier scores using the evaluation code provided by PAN (described in further detail under "Evaluation").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Data</head><p>The dataset provided for this task was compiled by Bischoff et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,384.95,398.56,12.93,10.91" target="#b6">[6]</ref> and includes texts from fanfiction.net, written in English. The fanfiction.net website contains extensions of fictional storylines (based on existing fiction) written by fans in which an alleged "fandom topic" describes the main subject in a given document. Each record in the dataset consists of two documents which may or may not be written by the same person and the fandom that each document was categorised under. The ground truth specifies the author identifiers for each document and the prediction target indicating if the two documents were written by the same person. The training dataset for the shared task was available in two sizes: a smaller dataset with 52,590 records and a larger dataset with 275,486 records, with each document containing about 21,000 characters and 4,800 tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Feature Selection</head><p>The motivation for our feature selection was largely influenced by frequently used features in previous studies involving linguistic style detection. The selection process was also based on the forensic linguistic method called Writeprint, which is primarily used for identifying different authors online. We also intuitively presumed that other linguistic or linguistically-inspired features might assist us in this task, and we decided to test features originating in various linguistic domains. Such domains include lexicon, syntax and linguistic structure, while other content-based pseudo-linguistic features were also tested. As previously mentioned, we have divided our feature list into vector-based and scalar features as our model treats these two types in a slightly different way. Some features could be represented in the vector-space. In this way, they serve as a natural metric for comparison: Cosine similarity which measures the angle between vectors, from which we calculate Cosine distance. Nonetheless, other features could only be expressed using a single number (scalar), since they are a result of defined counting methods, ratios and more elaborate mathematical formulae.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Vector-based Features</head><p>The following features are expressed in the vector-space and are computed in terms of TF-IDF (Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency). We chose to use TfidfVectorizer from the Scikit-learn Python library <ref type="bibr" coords="3,212.85,217.59,18.03,10.91" target="#b16">[16]</ref> to calculate the TF-IDF vectors for the text-pairs in all of the following features, except for the punctuation frequency feature: -Character n-grams: values for character n-grams. This is a lexical feature aimed to detect linguistic style based on character sequences. We define a character as any computer-accepted representation of a written symbol occupying a space in a text (including whitespace characters).</p><p>-Word n-grams: values for word n-grams. This is a lexical feature aimed to detect linguistic style based on word sequences. We define a word as a sequence of characters separated by either a whitespace character or a punctuation mark. We used the NLTK tokenizer's word_tokenize <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,325.98,12.84,10.91" target="#b5">[5]</ref> to generate our words.</p><p>-POS-tag (part-of-speech-tag) n-grams: values for POS-tag n-grams. This is a syntactic feature aimed to detect linguistic style based on POS sequences. POS refers to any syntactic category assigned to a given word. POS tagging is a supervised learning solution that uses features like the previous or next word, first-letter capitalization etc. We used NLTK's pos_tag method to obtain POS tags after performing the word tokenization process.</p><p>-POS-tag chunk n-grams: values for POS-tag chunk n-grams. This is a syntactic feature generated from partial parsing of syntactic trees assuming the X-bar theory of syntactic category formation, creating a syntactic sub-tree. The tokens we considered are the second-level tokens found on the syntactic tree.</p><p>-Punctuation Frequency: a syntactic feature aimed to detect linguistic style based on the usage of punctuation marks. We use it to counts all punctuation marks in a given text. In this case, we counted the instances manually without any use of a library counter and/or vectorizer.</p><p>-Stopwords vectorizer: a syntactic feature aimed to detect linguistic style based on the usage of stopwords. These words traditionally carry little to no meaning and can easily be ignored without compromising the overall meaning of a sentence. We used a pre-defined list from NLTK during our counting step. Additionally, we used Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer as an alternative way to describe character n-gram counts. In our experiment, all n-gram notions mentioned above refer to bigrams (n=2), apart from POS-tag n-grams where in addition to bigrams we experimented with unigrams (n=1). After extracting the above features, the similarity measure is calculated using Cosine distance, which is 1-Cosine similarity, shown below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,176.51,95.22,237.53,60.41">similarity = cos(𝜃) = A • B ‖A‖‖B‖ = 𝑛 ∑︀ 𝑖=1 𝐴 𝑖 𝐵 𝑖 √︃ 𝑛 ∑︀ 𝑖=1 𝐴 2 𝑖 √︃ 𝑛 ∑︀ 𝑖=1 𝐵 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>𝑖</head><p>, and:</p><p>distance = 1 -similarity While A and B are vector-based features from each text in a text-pair, n is the number of text-pairs and 𝜃 is the angle between the vectors expressing the features in each text. Note that unlike scalar features (detailed in the next subsection), vector-based features had to be fitted first before being transformed and ready to be used further in our experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Scalar Features</head><p>The following features were extracted by performing calculations resulting in a single number (scalar):</p><p>-Vocabulary Richness: a lexical feature based on a standard richness measure defined by a Type-Token ratio.</p><p>-Average Sentence Lengths: a lexical feature based on the average number of words per sentence in a given text.</p><p>-Flesch Reading Ease Score: a multivariate feature combining the count of syllables, words and sentences. This score is used for measuring text readability. It is meant to indicate how difficult it is to read a given text. This score is calculated using the following formula:</p><p>Readability Ease = 206.835</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,288.92,449.44,143.09,10.91">-(1.015 • ASL) -(84.6 • ASW)</formula><p>Where ASL stands for the average sentence length and ASW stands for the average number of syllables per each word.</p><p>We computed absolute differences of scalar feature values for each pair of texts. These differences, together with the Cosine distances of the vector-based features, were then concatenated into matrices which serve as input to our regression models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Feature Importance</head><p>During our experimentation process, we have tested many types of features, including additional ones that have not been presented in the article so far. These features include Yule's Richness Score, word lengths, emoticons and foul language. However, only the features that made the most impact were chosen moving forward. We used the feature importance parameter provided by the Random Forest classifier in an attempt to discover which features matter the most. In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,118.43,656.97,5.61,9.76" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we show the detailed normalised feature importance scores used by the Random Forest classifier (adapted as a regressor) for each feature we considered using over the entire dataset. The scalar features which were meant to extract frequencies of punctuation marks and stopwords (named 'Punctuation frequency' and 'Stopword frequency' accordingly) were essentially capturing the same information as their vector-based equivalents. However, they showed significantly lower importance scores, making it easier for us to decide to discard them and move ahead with some other scalar features instead, next in the level of importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Regression Models</head><p>We approached the Authorship Verification Task as a regression problem. The model's prediction output is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is a complete confidence that two texts are written by the same author. When calculating scores, we use binarization with a cut-off of 0.5. The training dataset (which was the entire dataset provided by PAN) was split into training-set (80%) and test-set (validation -20%). The best performing model selected was the one producing the lowest value of mean square error (calculated and averaged) under 5-fold cross-validation. We experimented with the following supervised learning models and hyperparameters: -Logistic Regression with C (inverse of regularization strength) = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10].</p><p>-Support Vector Machines with C (inverse of regularization strength = [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10].</p><p>-Random Forest with nr_estimators (number of trees) = [50, 100, 150, 200] and max_depth (number of nodes) = <ref type="bibr" coords="6,182.14,141.16,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,196.22,141.16,12.55,10.91" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,211.50,141.16,12.55,10.91" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,226.77,141.16,12.32,10.91" target="#b20">20]</ref>. Note that the feature matrix was normalised prior to being processed by the Support Vector Machines model. Random Forest (200 trees, 20 nodes) was selected as the best model and was subsequently run in the TIRA system. The model was then trained on the entire dataset. All the models used are implemented by the Python Scikit-learn library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Baseline</head><p>The baseline, which was provided by PAN, is a TF-IDF-weighted character n-grams, where the distance measure is expressed in Cosine distance. The baseline then uses a compression method to calculate the cross-entropy. The documents (texts) provided in the baseline are represented with a bag-of-character-n grams model that is TF-IDF-weighted. The Cosine distance measure between each document-pair in the calibration dataset is then calculated. Following an optimisation process, the previously-calculated similarities function as pseudoprobabilities indicating the likelihood that two documents in a given pair were written by the same author.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Evaluation</head><p>In order to examine the performance of our model, we used the evaluation platform provided by PAN, which includes the following parameters: AUC: the conventional area-under-thecurve score, as implemented in Scikit-learn. F1-score: the well-known performance measure (not taking into account non-answers), as implemented in Scikit-learn. c@1: a variant of the conventional F1-score, which rewards systems that leave difficult problems unanswered (i.e. scores of exactly 0.5), introduced by Peñas and Rodrigo (2011). F_0.5u: a newly proposed measure that puts more emphasis on deciding same-author cases correctly <ref type="bibr" coords="6,430.10,470.55,77.57,10.91;6,89.29,484.10,21.19,10.91" target="#b3">(Bevendorff et al. 2019)</ref>. Brier: the complement of the well-known Brier score, for evaluating the quality of (binary) probabilistic classifiers, as implemented in Scikit-learn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We present our results in two parts. The first part (shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,381.07,557.22,4.40,9.76" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) is the outcome of our own internal evaluation during best model selection using train/test split. The results are shown for the Random Forest classifier (adapted as a regressor), which was the best performing model.</p><p>The second part (shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,250.47,597.86,4.42,9.76" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) is the outcome of the evaluation code provided by PAN for baseline and our Random Forest model. Both models were trained over the entire training dataset and then evaluated upon it. The baseline model was trained with the vocabulary size set to 2,000 and the n-value of n-grams to 2. At a later stage we will be able to provide full results for the entire dataset. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>In this article, we described our strategy in building a machine learning model for the PAN 2021 Authorship Verification Task, where the aim was detecting whether or not two texts were written by the same author. Our strategy included the extraction of stylometric features from a given text-pair and calculating similarity measures between each of the texts. We used Cosine distance in vector-based features and absolute difference in scalar features. The similarity measures were then concatenated and used as input to each of our pre-selected regression models. The model was both internally evaluated under our own pre-set metrics and externally assessed by the PAN evaluation mechanism. Unlike the approach required to tackle Authorship Attribution problems, where a list of authors is known in advance, we offer a more generalised model applicable to any text-pairs without any prior knowledge about specific authors. The fact that our model performed well in an open-set verification setting, where the authors and topics are novel, reaffirms our confidence in the model we built. It also turns out that specific model selection did not have as much impact as we suspected to begin with, as performance was mostly influenced by the features we selected. For example, word and POS-tag frequencies were by far the most dominant ones. This can be explained intuitively as words and POS-tags are among the foundations of any written work (as they are in other linguistic paradigms), and we can easily see them as good "profilers" for writing style. For future research we could conduct a more thorough investigation regarding feature importance. We might then see new features added and existing ones removed. Furthermore, we believe it would be interesting to experiment with different values for the n's in the n-gram sequences we generated. Finally, we imagine using different syntactic trees' formation approaches than X-bar, namely dependency grammar and context-free grammar, such as Chomsky's normal form. Either of these has the potential to produce compelling results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,88.99,90.49,416.99,380.71"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Examined features (both included and excluded in our experiment) and their corresponding importance scores determined by the Random Forest Classifier</figDesc><table coords="5,139.65,134.06,315.99,337.13"><row><cell>Feature name</cell><cell>Feature Importance Score (Normalised)</cell></row><row><cell>Word bigrams (TF-IDF)</cell><cell>0.315</cell></row><row><cell>Punctuation frequency vectorizer</cell><cell>0.102</cell></row><row><cell>POS bigrams</cell><cell>0.096</cell></row><row><cell>Stopword vectorizer</cell><cell>0.096</cell></row><row><cell>POS-tag chunk bigrams</cell><cell>0.065</cell></row><row><cell>Character bigrams (Count)</cell><cell>0.061</cell></row><row><cell>Vocabulary Richness</cell><cell>0.059</cell></row><row><cell>Character bigrams (TF-IDF)</cell><cell>0.046</cell></row><row><cell>Word bigrams (TF-IDF)</cell><cell>0.315</cell></row><row><cell>Punctuation frequency (vectorizer)</cell><cell>0.102</cell></row><row><cell>POS-tag bigrams</cell><cell>0.096</cell></row><row><cell>Stopword unigrams</cell><cell>0.096</cell></row><row><cell>POS-tag chunk bigrams</cell><cell>0.065</cell></row><row><cell>Character trigrams (Count)</cell><cell>0.061</cell></row><row><cell>Vocabulary richness</cell><cell>0.059</cell></row><row><cell>Character trigrams (TF-IDF)</cell><cell>0.046</cell></row><row><cell>POS-tag unigrams</cell><cell>0.036</cell></row><row><cell>Punctuation frequency (scalar)</cell><cell>0.019</cell></row><row><cell>Stopword frequency (version 1)</cell><cell>0.018</cell></row><row><cell>Average sentence length</cell><cell>0.017</cell></row><row><cell>Flesch reading ease score</cell><cell>0.014</cell></row><row><cell>Number of emoticons</cell><cell>0.012</cell></row><row><cell>Average word length</cell><cell>0.010</cell></row><row><cell>Curse word frequency</cell><cell>0.010</cell></row><row><cell>Consecutive capitalization</cell><cell>0.009</cell></row><row><cell>Stopword frequency (version 2)</cell><cell>0.008</cell></row><row><cell>Words with consecutive characters</cell><cell>0.007</cell></row></table></figure>
