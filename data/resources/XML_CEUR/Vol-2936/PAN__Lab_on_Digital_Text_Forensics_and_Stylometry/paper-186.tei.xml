<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There have such phenomena as telecommunication, email fraud and terrorist attacks in today's society, so it is important to verify unknown authorship. Authorship verification is an active research area of computational linguistics that can be considered as a fundamental question of stylometry, namely whether or not two texts are written by the same author <ref type="bibr" coords="1,353.16,422.16,11.79,10.70" target="#b1">[1]</ref>. Accordingly, it has become one of the staple sharing tasks at PAN. The work presented in this paper was developed as a solution to the Authorship verification task for the competition PAN @ CLEF 2021 1 . At PAN 2021, authorship verification belongs to an open-set verification task that test dataset contains verification cases from training dataset's unseen authors and topics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,265.79,472.81,11.70,10.70" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, so a writing style model has built for training dataset's author or topic is not supported on open-set verification task. Accordingly, our idea is to encode text information to get the text feature and determine whether two texts are the same author by comparing the similarity of the features.</p><p>In recent years, more and more pre-trained models, typified by BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.65,523.31,11.70,10.70" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, have performed well in natural language processing. In particular, BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="1,238.28,548.63,11.70,10.70" target="#b4">[4]</ref>, has achieved considerable improvement in encoding text information. However, we also noticed that BERT could not encode long text efficiently. In order to encode the long text, our method is to split long texts into short texts that BERT can encode, then obtain the similarity of local text by combining two short texts from two long texts, respectively. Finally, the overall similarity of two long texts can be obtained by integrating these local similarities.</p><p>Authorship verification task datasets consist of many fanfictions, which were obtained drawn from fanfiction.net, and they are writing in which fans use media narratives and pop cultural icons as inspiration for creating their own texts. The datasets include large and small training dataset, which consists of pairs of (snippets from) two different fanfics. They include 275,565 and 52,601 pairs of texts, respectively. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,158.53,125.52,5.52,10.70" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the results of data analysis over both datasets. The Samples column shows the number of text pairs, and the last three columns show the Characters' statistics of texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method 3.1. Network Architecture</head><p>Given two texts, denoted as text1 and text2, the task of Authorship Verification is to decide whether they are written by the same author. Suppose text1 = {t11, t12, ……, t1N}, where t11 is the first fragment of text1 and t1N is the Nth fragment of text1. Text2 = {t21, t22, ……, t2N}, where t21 is the first fragment of text2 and t2N is the Nth fragment of text2. The N number set to 30, so a text pair would be split into 30 short text pairs. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,188.16,388.09,5.52,10.70" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the network architecture. It can be observed, a text pair can be split into N short text pairs, and the t 1it2i is one of the short text pairs that consist of the ith fragment of text1 and text2. By using BERT to encode these short text pairs, Then the text representation is obtained by concatenating these text features. Finally, we feed the text representation into a fully connected neural network to build a binary classification model, which determines whether two texts have been written by the same author.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,161.88,426.01,271.07,38.66">t11 t12 … t1i … t1N t21 t22 … t2i … t2N t11t21 t12t22 … t1it2i … t1Nt2N</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Text Preprocessing</head><p>Text preprocessing corresponds to the first three steps in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,364.70,172.33,4.14,10.70" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We use punctuation as a separator to intercept the first 30 fragments of each text sample. Now each train sample's text1 and text2 all have 30 fragments, and their labels are the same, so a text pair constructs 30 sub-training samples. We combine the corresponding fragments of text1 and text2, then they were tokenized and sequence padded to be a vector of max length 256.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2:</head><p>This is an example of how we preprocessed a text pair. The &lt;CLS&gt; is a special symbol added in front of every input example, and the &lt;SEP&gt; is a special separator token that can be used to separate two fragments in this example.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental setting</head><p>In this work, BERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) is chosen as pre-trained model size, and we use Keras to construct BERT and fully connected network classification model. A text pair is split into 30 short texts and tokenized to a vector that its shape is (30, M), and there have 52,601 such vectors on the small dataset, where the M is the max length of short texts. In the fine-tuning pre-trained model phase, we set 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏ℎ_𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 30 and use sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and the optimization method is Adam with a 2e-5 learning rate. Using BERT to encode text information, we obtain the feature vector and reshape it to (52601, 30, 768). After global pooling of one-dimension, its shape becomes (52601,768). The first fully connected layer output hidden size is 16, and its activation is ReLU. The other FC layer output hidden size is 2, and its activation is softmax. The final FC network is trained for 400 epochs, and its optimization is Adam.</p><p>I shift a bit, warily letting my eyes dart from one owl to the other --but my eyes are trained on the Barn Owl the most. Like Hoole...so like Hoole... He turns a bit, and our eyes meet directly. I can"t describe it...in this next moment, I don"t look away, how awkward it seems. I stare into his eyes. They"re like Hoole"s... They are Barn Owl eyes, but Hoole"s eyes. They"re his eyes...Hoole"s eyes... They hold that light of valor, justice, that one glow that I always made me feel my gizzard twitch in the bottom of my heart. Hoole... He never wanted me, did he? He loved me, but only who I was pretending to be. He never loved me, only Emerilla...lucky owl. I just wanted to belong --because I was nothing --and he gave me that. He was so fair, so kind...he gave me something even Kreeth could not. Mum and Da --Ygryk and Pleek --were supposed to be my parents. I was supposed to be their chick, Lutta. …… "All will become one with Russia," he said, almost simply, his cheer eerie.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To evaluate the proposed model, two splitting strategies are adopted on the given training small dataset. The first one is 36,821 text pairs for the training dataset and 15,780 text pairs for the validation dataset, and the other is 45,000 for training dataset and 7,601 for valid dataset. The experimental results on the validation dataset are denoted as Val-1 and Val-2 separately. It can be observed, with the increase of the training sample, the overall score would be increased.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose the method that utilizes a pre-trained model to encode text information to solve the authorship verification in the PAN@CLEF 2021. To resolve the problem of long text encoding, the method we proposed is to split long texts into short texts that a pre-trained model, BERT, can encode. As can be observed above Tabel 3, the classification model achieved the highest c@1 and F1-score on the small dataset of PAN Authorship Verification datasets. Accordingly, the approach described can encode long text information efficiently in long text pairs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,72.00,717.39,204.14,10.83"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Architecture diagram for our model.</figDesc></figure>
