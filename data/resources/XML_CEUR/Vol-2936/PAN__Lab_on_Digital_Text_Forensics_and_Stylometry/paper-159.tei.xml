<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social media is perhaps one of the most powerful channels of communication among people worldwide. Despite the physical constraints, people in social networks such as Twitter interchange efficiently and instantaneously ideas and information without restriction. In this scenario, hate speech emerges as a problem when communication denigrates a person or a group based on some characteristics such as race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.</p><p>Automatic identification of hate speech has been popular because of the nature of social networks, and it has been tackled on several fronts. On the one hand, several competitions have been run contests at the message level. For example, the HatEval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,385.51,541.74,12.86,9.46" target="#b0">[1]</ref> challenge considers the identification of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter as a two-class classification problem, i.e., whether a tweet is hateful or not hateful. Also, OffensEval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,402.02,568.83,12.58,9.46" target="#b1">[2]</ref> challenge consists in determining whether a given message has offensive content. This event runs several tasks, such as identifying whether a message has offensive language and categorizing offense types. Among the offense types, OffensEval considers messages containing an insult or threat to someone, or a tweet containing non-targeted profanity and swearing, and identifying the target, i.e., whether the offensive content is about an individual, a group, or others. On the other hand, author profiling has become a powerful tool for NLP applications offering multiple approaches to tackle several tasks such as author attribute identification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.19,128.69,11.95,9.46" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,336.70,128.69,7.96,9.46" target="#b3">4]</ref>, sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.63,128.69,11.94,9.46" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,454.13,128.69,7.96,9.46" target="#b5">6]</ref>, and text classification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,147.72,142.24,11.44,9.46" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this sense, the PAN @ CLEF21 challenge considers the profiling hate speech spreaders task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.35,155.79,11.69,9.46" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.77,155.79,7.79,9.46" target="#b8">9]</ref>, identifying authors who have shared some hate speech in the past according to the tweets published. The competition determines whether a user is a hate speech spreader given a set of 200 tweets per author, for English and Spanish languages. Approaches to face this problem commonly use external information such as lexicons or datasets from related domains to enrich the knowledge database or encode semantic information generally using word embeddings. In the following sections, we introduce the tools used in our approach to profiling hate speech spreaders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sentiment and emotion lexicons</head><p>Using lexicons of labeled words is a fundamental tool in many text classification approaches. The main idea behind this method is to use curated information that associates words with some helpful information to solve the task.</p><p>Despite that dictionary-based classifiers are among the first approaches in the community, its simplicity and the inherent ability of explanation, these methods remain popular even today. For instance, Nielsen <ref type="bibr" coords="2,165.60,355.65,18.08,9.46" target="#b9">[10]</ref> introduces AFINN,<ref type="foot" coords="2,269.55,353.60,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_0">1</ref> a lexicon associating a vocabulary of more than three thousand words in four languages with a degree of sentiment. It also includes sentiment scores for emojis. Bing Liu <ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.14,382.75,17.14,9.46" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.00,382.75,9.02,9.46" target="#b4">5]</ref> also provides a list of English words and their associated sentiment. <ref type="foot" coords="2,501.50,380.70,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_1">2</ref>Currently, the lexicon contains close to 6800 entries. Mohammed and Turney <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.22,396.30,18.32,9.46" target="#b11">[12]</ref> introduced the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (also called EmoLex);<ref type="foot" coords="2,386.87,407.80,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_2">3</ref> the lexicon contains more than 14,000 English words associated with eight basic emotions: anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. EmoLex also provides the scoring for both negative and positive sentiments. All these lexicons have been automatically translated into several languages. The number of words has also been increased since their creations.</p><p>However, one of the main drawbacks of lexicons is that they need to be created by experts and have an inherent dependence on language and domain. Another critical issue is the lack of exhaustiveness due to the explosion of terms (e.g., neologisms, inflections, synonymy, hyponymy, hypernymy). Finally, depending on the domain, the lexical variations and errors also negatively affect the performance of the models.</p><p>Our work is based on the EmoLex dictionary along with semantic representations of the vocabulary to cope with many of the issues regarding plain lexicons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word embeddings</head><p>Several of these limiting issues can be solved using semantic word-embeddings, which are semantic lexicons associating words with a vector in a semantic space. Semantic spaces are learned from a huge non-annotated text corpus, based on the distributional hypothesis of semantics, i.e., words with similar meanings will tend to appear in similar contexts. Some examples of word embeddings are fastText <ref type="bibr" coords="3,198.23,115.14,18.17,9.46" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and Global vectors (GloVe) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,341.97,115.14,16.72,9.46" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Semantic language models are sophisticated methods dedicated to understanding language, and they are created to predict the semantic of a sequence of words through very large non-annotated corpora. Our approach centers on word meanings instead of sentence meanings; therefore, language models are beyond the scope of this contribution. The interested reader is referred to the related literature <ref type="bibr" coords="3,179.87,182.89,17.27,9.46" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,199.87,182.89,13.64,9.46" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,216.23,182.89,13.64,9.46" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.59,182.89,12.95,9.46" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>FastText<ref type="foot" coords="3,136.87,194.39,3.99,6.91" target="#foot_3">4</ref> is a word-embedding with a fast construction. It learns word distributional semantic using small windows around words. In addition to other approaches, it is designed to tackle out-of-vocabulary words using subwords which are small substrings that compose words and are to compute word-vectors whenever a word is unknown. Using fastText models, we cope with the vocabulary diversity found in social networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Machine learning models</head><p>A popular way to tackle author profiling problems is supervised learning; in this approach, a set of labeled examples is given to an algorithm to create a model that can label never-seen examples. The PAN @ CLEF21 asks for profiling of hate speech spreaders using user's textual information retrieved from Twitter. Therefore, our dataset examples are a list of text messages and their associated label.</p><p>Classical supervised learning will receive a set of examples (𝑋, 𝑦) of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,89.29,368.85,429.79,24.18">𝑋 = 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , • • • , 𝑥 𝑛 and 𝑦 = 𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 , • • • , 𝑦 𝑛 ,</formula><p>where 𝑥 𝑖 is a vector of some dimension 𝛿, i.e., 𝑥 𝑖 ∈ R 𝛿 . On the other hand, 𝑦 𝑖 is a categorical value that represents a valid class. For this matter, profiling methods based on supervised learning need to transform input messages into a real-valued vector, 𝑦 is often obtained by human annotators that assign a label to each example. From a general perspective, the vectorization can be based on how authors write, the actual content, or the meaning of their messages. More detailed, we can capture how authors write using stylometry features <ref type="bibr" coords="3,464.77,450.49,16.70,9.46" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The content-based representations follow a generic procedure that relies on preprocessing the text, tokenize it with a variety of possible schemes to create bag-of-words, and then using a weighting scheme to vectorize <ref type="bibr" coords="3,183.23,491.14,11.94,9.46" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,198.94,491.14,13.05,9.46" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Other more sophisticated approaches use word embeddings or language models to vectorize using the semantic of the author's messages. Section 2 shows how our approach handles this step.</p><p>Once the dataset is in the (𝑋, 𝑦) form, we need to learn from these examples to obtain a predicting model. There are different types of machine learning models used for the Author Profiling task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,148.34,558.89,16.56,9.46" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For instance, we evaluate our approach with Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, among others. The details about these methods are studied in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,247.62,585.99,17.40,9.46" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,268.12,585.99,14.61,9.46" target="#b22">23]</ref> and the precise implementation is documented in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,599.53,16.72,9.46" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Our contribution</head><p>This notebook tackles the problem of profiling Hate Speech Spreaders, in Spanish and English languages, through its published messages in social media. In particular, we focus on the homonymous task in PAN @ CLEF21 for benchmarking our model. Each dataset, English, and Spanish, contains 200 cases for each of the two languages, each dataset contains 200 different authors, and each author is represented by two hundred messages. Furthermore, each author is labeled as a hate speech spreader or not.</p><p>Our approach is designed to be explainable through the projection of users into an Emotionspace induced by EmoLex. It can support variations of the same concepts and lexical variations of the same word based on semantic representations with the help of fastText. Multilingual support for Spanish and English languages is straightforward since translations of EmoLex, and existing pre-trained models of fastText for Spanish and English languages. We test our emotion-based encoding with seven different classifiers and provide a brief statistical analysis in the experimental results section. Section 2 details our modeling approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Roadmap</head><p>This section contextualizes our participation in PAN @ CLEF21. Section 2 details the construction and prediction stages of our model. The experimental setup and results are described in sections 3 and 4. Our final comments and conclusions are given in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Emotion-based modeling of users</head><p>Our model is pretty general and straightforward. However, its construction needs a set of Emotion-prototypes based on the emotion lexicon and word embeddings. We use the EmoLex and pre-trained FastText embeddings for both Spanish and English languages. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,456.40,436.52,5.35,9.46" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the general flow of the prototype's computation.</p><p>First, the procedure segments words per emotion; in the case of the EmoLex, it associates each word with ten emotions and sentiments: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, negative, positive, sadness, surprise, and trust. Note that words linked with several emotions will be linked with such emotions. The emotion sub-lexicons are then used to create a unique vector prototype that summarizes the emotion using word embeddings of individual words, using the companion fastText word-embedding model. These emotion-prototypes are stored as 𝑃 = {𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , • • • , 𝑝 10 }, and will be used to encode user's messages and be able to train the models and predict new instances.</p><p>Once emotion-prototypes are created, we can train and predict. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,412.79,572.01,5.53,9.46" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the flow that transforms an author into an emotion vector. Each author is represented as the sequence of its messages; these messages are plain text normalized and partitioned into a list of tokens. This procedure removes diacritic symbols, punctuation signs, duplicate letters, stop words, URLs, and emojis in this step. Along with text normalization, all user mentions are normalized to USER. Messages are then tokenized as unigrams. Finally, these unigrams are used to create a sequence that will be used to create a 300-dimensional vector.</p></div>

The classifiers SVM for English and LSVM for Spanish evidence that their data points consistently hover around the center values; thus, the predictions will have less variation. Likewise, these two models have competitive medians</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of emotion-based hate speech spreader models</head><p>Gradient boosting is an ensemble of decision trees that, instead of accessing data through a kernel function, accesses attributes directly. Decision trees require the computation of the importance of each attribute as part of its construction algorithm; it is feasible to use it outside of the decision tree context to obtain insight into the problem. In particular, we use the Gini importance <ref type="bibr" coords="9,476.58,513.95,18.18,9.46" target="#b23">[24]</ref> to measure the influence of each attribute on the final decision.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,130.32,541.05,5.35,9.46">4</ref> shows the importance of each attribute, as seen by our models. For example, in the case of English, Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,160.26,554.60,8.74,9.46">4a</ref>, there is some remarkable difference between the fourth most important and the rest of them. Trust, Disgust, Anticipation, and Joy are the most critical predictors in English, highlighting Trust and Disgust. On the other hand, Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,329.45,581.70,10.76,9.46">4b</ref> shows the attribute importance for the Spanish language; Disgust dominates the other features, clearly standing out for determining hate speech spreaders. Our Spanish modeling closely mimics Plutchik's classification of emotions <ref type="bibr" coords="9,487.96,608.80,18.03,9.46" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that link hatred to three primary emotions: Disgust, Anger, and Fear.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,132.18,635.90,5.56,9.46">5</ref> shows the emotion and sentiment distributions per class, computed on the PAN @ CLEF21 training set. The top row shows distributions for the English language. Here we observe that no hate speech spreaders (negative examples) have large variations in their emotions as  compared with those in the positive class. Note that several median values (white point in the box inside the violin shape) also dramatically moves. This effect is easily noticeable by those features with the highest Gini importance, see Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="11,307.16,101.60,8.51,9.46">4a</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure" coords="11,357.92,101.60,10.09,9.46">5c</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="11,388.63,101.60,10.69,9.46">5d</ref> illustrates how emotions distributes for the Spanish language writers for negative and positive classes. Again, we observe that mass concentrates around the median for positive class; we can also observe a noticeable difference, the median in some attributes like Anger, disgust, and fear; this could be associated with a higher emotional charge in the Spanish language Hate Speech spreaders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper proposes Semantic Emotion-based models on both Spanish and English languages to cope with the Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders challenge at PAN @ CLEF21. Our approach was designed to be explainable through the projection of users into an Emotion-space induced by EmoLex, supporting lexical variations of the same word based on semantic representations with the help of word embeddings such as fastText.</p><p>We conducted a broad model selection study to get the best performing algorithms for our approach. In this sense, we selected SVM with RBF kernel for English and Linear SVC for Spanish as our emotional-based models. Unfortunately, the accuracy of our models was 5% lower on the test set compared to the cross-validation results.</p><p>There is still room to improve our work in the future; our next steps in the research include exploring the use of different word embeddings and lexicons with different emotion classifications to improve the overall effectiveness of the classification process. Due to our emotion-centered modeling, we noticed that the Spanish model closely mimics Plutchik's classification of emotions for hatred from our experiments. This behavior requires a more profound exploration to describe its effect on a more fine scale.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,89.29,336.66,258.93,9.35"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Computing emotion-prototypes for our modeling.</figDesc></figure>
