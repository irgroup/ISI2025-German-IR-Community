<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The growth of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has originated an increasing presence of online hatespreaders. This fact undermines the integrity of online conversations by sharing inflammatory claims that influence public opinion while sow conflict on social or political issues. In this work, we propose a system for Authors Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders in the Twitter Spanish and English tasks at PAN@CLEF 2021. We present a hybrid system that uses Transformer-based models as feature extractors at the tweet level in combination with mixed pooling techniques. This approach allows computing the author's representative embeddings, which later fed an ML classifier. We explore the incorporation of features from Transformer-based models, Sentiment Analysis, and Hate lexicons to boost the feature extraction process. The results show that through this approach, it is possible to achieve 67% and 78% accuracy in the English and Spanish test datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Author profiling is part of digital text forensics and aims at determining the characteristics of the author of a document (i.e., age, gender, personality) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,313.28,472.83,11.28,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As Online Social Networks (OSNs) grow, this task has become even more critical. As an example, platforms such as Twitter have recently experienced an increase in the use of abusive language and hate-based activities, partially promoted by the anonymity of its users, a fact that favours the presence of hate spreaders <ref type="bibr" coords="1,482.58,513.48,11.23,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,496.43,513.48,7.49,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The existence of online hate-spreaders undermines the integrity of online conversations by sharing inflammatory claims that influence public opinion and sow conflict on social or political issues <ref type="bibr" coords="1,118.50,554.13,11.38,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,132.59,554.13,7.59,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Therefore, the development of tools devoted to identifying hate-spreading at the author level is a new crucial challenge in the ever-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>The scope of this paper is to describe a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approach that makes use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for the PAN@CLEF21 Author Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders on Twitter Task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,342.45,114.06,11.35,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.53,114.06,7.47,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,366.73,114.06,7.57,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>. This paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 provides a general view of some related works on author profiling and the description of the PAN 2021 task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.47,141.16,11.23,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,263.14,141.16,7.49,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Section 3 introduces our proposed approach. Section 4 describes the results from the experiments conducted. Finally, the conclusions are covered in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task Description and Related work</head><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in author profiling and hate speech detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.63,226.89,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Since 2013, PAN organizers have proposed different tasks of author profiling in social media such as fake news spreader detection, bot detection, or age and gender characterization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.87,253.99,11.40,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,474.00,253.99,7.60,10.91" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The current task addressed in this paper of Author Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders on Twitter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,483.32,267.54,11.23,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,497.11,267.54,8.88,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref> consists in determining whether an author spreads hate speech given its Twitter feed. The task adopts a multilingual perspective since the challenge includes both English and Spanish languages. For each language, the training data includes 200 authors with a Twitter feed of 200 tweets per author. For the English and Spanish tasks, the performance of the system is ranked in terms of accuracy as it is a binary classification, and the training data is balanced.</p><p>The complexity involved in natural language makes hate-speech detection a very challenging task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,109.85,362.38,17.76,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and requires a well-defined feature extraction process to infer the linguistic properties that enable hate-speech detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.34,375.93,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Regarding the feature extraction process, different studies have been dedicated to the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in combination with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Traditional feature extraction techniques such as Bag-of-words (BoW) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.18,416.58,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and ML algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines <ref type="bibr" coords="2,487.91,416.58,18.07,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Naive Bayes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.52,430.13,16.11,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, have been applied for hate-speech classification. As artificial intelligence techniques evolve, DL approaches were incorporated in this task, beating traditional state-ofthe-art methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.81,457.22,16.31,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,199.32,457.22,12.91,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> the authors propose a transfer learning approach for hate speech understanding using the unsupervised pretrained model BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,367.91,470.77,17.84,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> fine-tuned for hate-speech. Moreover, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks have also been proposed in the SemEval 2019 Task 5, also known as HatEval, focused on detecting hate speech against immigrants and women in Spanish and English at tweet-level <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.60,511.42,11.30,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Overall, multiple scientific projects have been dedicated to addressing the aspects of author profiling in social media with a focus on hate-speech detection, where NLP in combination with ML and DL methods have shown excellent results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Profiling Hate Speech Spreaders with transformers and mixed pooling</head><p>This section overviews our approach for Hate Speech Spreaders profiling. During the feature extraction process, a Transformer-based model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,294.64,642.18,17.75,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is used in combination with a mixed pooling technique <ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.13,655.73,18.07,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that allows to extract a representative embedding for each user according to his/her tweets. The embeddings are then used to train a Machine Learning classifier, which classifies the author as hate-spreader or non-hate-spreader.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Overview</head><p>A general overview of the proposed approach is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,383.46,596.57,3.66,10.91">1</ref>. The first step is to preprocess the text data contained in each tweet. Then, we extract features from each preprocessed tweet using a pretrained transformer for each language. These models take as input a single tweet text and are fine-tuned to perform a binary classification where the input is labelled as hate or non-hate using the English or Spanish HatEval data <ref type="bibr" coords="3,378.37,650.77,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the features used to represent each tweet are extracted from the output of the last hidden layer before the classification layer. According to how the transformer architecture operates <ref type="bibr" coords="4,128.83,100.52,16.30,10.91" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,147.68,100.52,12.23,10.91" target="#b13">14]</ref>, these features depict features for each word received as input. Thus, a pooling technique is required to condense these features into one representation, which can be then used to represent the whole tweet. A second mixed pooling is then applied to obtain a representation of the complete feed of each user, combining the representation of each of his/her tweets.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the pooling technique used for combining both the words representing one tweet and the whole author feed is mixed pooling. Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,407.48,168.26,17.86,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> introduced mixed pooling as a hybrid approach between average pooling and max pooling (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,465.59,181.81,3.58,10.91">2</ref>). These authors proved the superiority of mixed pooling over max and average pooling techniques for image classification as it captures more local spatial information. As well as average and max pooling techniques are used in the NLP field, the mixed pooling technique can also infer information encoded in different embeddings into one single embedding <ref type="bibr" coords="4,414.15,236.01,16.43,10.91" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,433.31,236.01,12.32,10.91" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,251.42,249.56,5.17,10.91">2</ref> only describes the pooling process for condensing one feed of tweet embeddings into an user embedding. However, the same mixed pooling technique is also used for condensing word embeddings into tweet embedding. Firstly, the Twitter feed embeddings from a user are split into groups named windows. Secondly, average pooling is performed across each dimension of the window embedding. Finally, the user embedding is obtained by applying max pooling across the dimensions of the different average window embeddings computed in the previous step. Consequently, the number of windows is a hyperparameter that affects the outcome user embeddings that will be fed into a classifier, where mixed pooling is equal to max pooling when the window size (the number of items by window) is 1 and equal to average pooling when the window size is equal to the number of tweet feed (i.e., 200 tweets).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Pre-processing</head><p>Different preprocessing steps are applied for English and Spanish tasks. Although the PAN@CLEF21 task's data are already preprocessed at a certain level (URLs, Twitter's mentions, and hashtags are already normalized with special tokens), it is necessary to apply a more intense text preprocessing due to the noise introduced by Twitter slang. This preprocessing step is applied to both the PAN@CLEF21 data and the HatEval data used for training the transformer-based models.</p><p>English users' tweets are preprocessed using the ftfy package <ref type="bibr" coords="4,384.93,502.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to repair Unicode and emoji errors; tweet-preprocessor package<ref type="foot" coords="4,267.97,514.32,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> for deleting mentions, URLs, hashtags, and reserved characters (i.e., RT, FAV); and ekphrasis package <ref type="bibr" coords="4,305.04,529.62,17.94,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for normalizing percentages, time, dates, emails, phones and numbers. Contractions and emojis are not removed. For Spanish users' tweets, the same preprocessing steps are implemented adding a normalizing Spanish accent step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Feature Extraction</head><p>Turning now to the transformer-based models used for feature extraction at tweet level, firstly, we established a baseline approach based on two models fine-tuned on English and Spanish HatEval tasks, respectively. Besides, feature enhancement was also tested by concatenating new features to the baseline from other resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Baseline approach</head><p>To select an English tweet-level feature extractor model based on transformers, we evaluated different models already fine-tuned and our own model distilroberta-base fine-tuned on the English HatEval task <ref type="bibr" coords="5,150.29,176.94,11.58,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. On the other hand, the already fine-tuned models were bertweet-base-hate, twitter-roberta-base-hate, bertweet-base-offensive and twitter-roberta-base-offensive, all of them belonging the to cardiffnlp group<ref type="foot" coords="5,236.88,202.29,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . The transformer based models considered for Spanish feature extraction were stsb-xlm-r-multilingual and distilbert-multilingual-nli-stsb-quora-ranking, fine-tuned and evaluated only with Spanish HatEval data, and stsb-xlm-r-multilingual, fine-tuned and evaluated with English and Spanish HatEval data. These multilingual models are part of the sentence-transformers group <ref type="foot" coords="5,213.12,270.03,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . All these models are publicly available at Hugging Transformer API <ref type="bibr" coords="5,107.81,285.34,16.09,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The model with the best performance in each language in terms of the official HatEval metric (macro-averaged F1-score) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,241.52,298.89,12.84,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is selected as the feature extractor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Feature Enhancement approach</head><p>The feature enhancement approach appends new features to the baseline system by concatenating features from Vader-Sentiment-Analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="5,300.69,361.76,16.18,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, Hatebase lexicon <ref type="foot" coords="5,398.52,360.01,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> and Detoxify <ref type="bibr" coords="5,465.48,361.76,16.18,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The Vader-Sentiment-Analysis provide four new features: positive, negative and neutral scores, and an overall normalized score from the different sentiment lexicons ratings used by the Vader system named the compound score. It is only available for the English task. The Hatebase lexicon is a collection that contains multilingual parsed hateful lexicons used in the OSNs associated with a hate score. Therefore, Hatebase adds two new features, the frequency of hate lexicons detected in a user Twitter feed and the average hate score from these lexicons. Finally, a new feature is supplemented with the prediction of the Detoxify model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,445.01,456.61,16.10,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Author classification: Hyperparameter tuning and classifier</head><p>The classifiers tested were Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization (LR1 and LR2, respectively), Elastic Net, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for both English and Spanish tasks, models that have shown excellent results in other researches <ref type="bibr" coords="5,138.62,574.08,16.25,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>To obtain the best results and avoid overfitting, we tuned the hyperparameters of the transformer-based models, the number of windows for mixed pooling, and the hyperparameters of the classifiers using Grid and Bayesian search methods.

Moreover, this fine-tuned model scores the same as the complex feature enhancing approach proposed by Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,297.98,660.48,18.07,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> composed of the concatenation of ELMo, BERT base uncased and CNNs neural networks.

Reimers and Gurevych <ref type="bibr" coords="7,198.65,154.71,18.07,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> developed this model using the teacher-student technique for distilling the knowledge from a monolingual model fine-tuned on STS Benchmark <ref type="bibr" coords="7,451.34,168.26,17.77,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref> into the XLM-RoBERTa model <ref type="bibr" coords="7,188.08,181.81,16.14,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Remarkably, when we fine-tune this model on the Spanish HatEval task, it achieves better results than the topmost model from the original competition (73.00% F1-score). Therefore, this model is selected as the baseline method for Spanish feature extraction at tweet level. </p></div>

We presented a hybrid system composed of transformer-based models as tweet-level feature extractors, mixed pooling as pooling technique to compute author embeddings, and Machine Learning models as classifiers. Finally, we achieved an accuracy score of 78% in Spanish and 67% in English, leading to an average accuracy of 72.5%. In future work, we will most likely test new pooling techniques, such as attentional pooling, and add more hate-labelled data to refine the feature extraction models and boost their performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1" coords="3,89.29,281.41,417.35,8.96;3,89.29,293.36,400.70,8.96"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Diagram of the architecture of the proposed approach.
