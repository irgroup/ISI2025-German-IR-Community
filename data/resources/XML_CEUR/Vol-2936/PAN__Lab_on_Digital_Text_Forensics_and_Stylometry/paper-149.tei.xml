<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Hate speech (HS) is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a person or a group on the basis of some characteristic, such as race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or others <ref type="bibr" coords="1,227.94,413.65,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Given the huge amount of user-generated content on the Web and, in particular, on social media, the problem of detecting and, if possible, contrasting the HS diffusion, is becoming fundamental, for instance, in the fight against misogyny and xenophobia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,143.74,454.30,11.43,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Having previously profiled bots <ref type="bibr" coords="1,242.38,467.85,12.74,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and fake news spreaders <ref type="bibr" coords="1,368.40,467.85,11.34,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, at PAN'21 we have focused on profiling hate speech spreaders in social media, more specifically on Twitter, addressing the problem both in English and Spanish, as we did in the previous author profiling tasks. The goal has been to identify those Twitter users that can be considered haters, depending on the number of tweets with hateful content that they had spread. Our hypothesis is that users who do not spread hate speech may have a set of different characteristics compared to users who do. For example, they may use different linguistic patterns when they share posts compared to hate speech spreaders.</p><p>This is what we aim at investigating in this year's author profiling shared task where we address the problem of hate speech detection from the author profiling perspective. The final goal is profiling those authors who have shared some hate speech in the past. This will allow for identifying possible hate speech spreaders on Twitter as a first step towards preventing hate speech from being propagated among social media users. This should help for their early detection and, therefore, for preventing their further dissemination.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 covers the state of the art, Section 3 describes the corpus and the evaluation measures, and Section 4 presents the approaches submitted by the participants. Sections 5 and 6 discuss results and draw conclusions respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Hate speech detection has received significant attention in the last few years. As a consequence, there are several available resources that can be used to identify hate speech. The survey in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.26,226.89,12.72,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> presents a systematic analysis of a number of these resources. Corpora, lexicons and other resources are characterised in different dimensions. Moreover, there are other surveys that analyze different approaches used for hate speech detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,363.40,267.54,11.43,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.57,267.54,7.50,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,387.80,267.54,7.50,10.91" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,398.03,267.54,7.50,10.91" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,408.26,267.54,12.57,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.57,267.54,12.57,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,438.87,267.54,12.38,10.91" target="#b11">12]</ref>. In the vast amount of work, the approaches range from strategies based on linguistic features to more recent strategies based on deep learning. The work in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,339.92,294.63,18.06,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> proposed a classifier based on a lexicon for hate speech detection. The lexicon is built with a rule-based approach that focuses on extracting subjective features. The experimental results suggested the inclusion of semantic and topic-based features. However, the use of machine learning approaches is recommended to improve the precision and recall scores. Moreover, other low-level features have been used, such as part-of-speech tags and dependency relationships <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.89,362.38,16.55,10.91" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,373.23,362.38,12.42,10.91" target="#b12">13]</ref>. For example, the authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,100.97,375.93,17.97,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> employed a supervised classification method that considers different features that can be divided into four classes: 𝑛-grams, linguistic, syntactic and distributional semantics.</p><p>On the other hand, several systems use traditional machine learning models such as support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,313.21,416.58,16.30,10.91" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.94,416.58,12.50,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,346.88,416.58,12.23,10.91" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,432.40,416.58,17.76,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref> proposed an approach based on SVM that achieved state-of-the-art performance. It was simple and produced decisions easier to interpret than neural network methods according to the analysis of the authors. Other systems are based on deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) networks, including also attention mechanisms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.88,470.77,16.31,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.04,484.32,12.59,10.91" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.12,484.32,12.59,10.91" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.20,484.32,12.59,10.91" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.28,484.32,12.59,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.36,484.32,12.59,10.91" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.44,484.32,12.42,10.91" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Moreover, some works proposed ensembles of neural networks. For example, the authors in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,200.59,497.87,18.07,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> combined ten CNNs with different initialisation weights in an ensemble to improve the detection of hate speech. Among the deep learning models, the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) has been widely used <ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.63,524.97,16.55,10.91" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,538.52,12.59,10.91" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.37,538.52,12.59,10.91" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,121.44,538.52,12.59,10.91" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.52,538.52,12.42,10.91" target="#b26">27]</ref>. The work presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,268.12,538.52,18.07,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> investigates the potentialities of BERT for hate speech detection within social media by transfer learning with fine-tuned methods. The results showed that this strategy obtains a considerable performance in comparison to other existing approaches.</p><p>While most of the approaches focus on detecting whether a text is hateful or not, few works focus on the user account level detection. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.30,606.27,16.09,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the authors studied the flow of posts generated by users on Gab 1 . The authors analysed the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful users, focusing on the diffusion dynamics of hateful users. The observations suggested that hateful content propagates farther, wider and faster. Unlike this work, where the analysis was</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Corpus</head><p>To build the PAN-AP-2021 corpus <ref type="foot" coords="4,240.61,105.78,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">2</ref> we have proceeded as follows. Firstly, we have looked for users considered potential haters. To do so, we have followed two approaches: (i) a keywordbased one (e.g. searching for hateful words mainly towards women or immigrants); and (ii) a user-based one, by inspecting users known as haters (e.g. users appearing in reports and/or press) and following their networks (followers and followees). Secondly, for the identified users, we have collected their timelines and manually annotated those tweets conveying hate. Thirdly, we have labelled as "keen to spread hate speech" those users with more than ten hateful tweets. Finally, we have collected two hundred tweets per Twitter user to build up the final dataset. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,127.22,308.67,5.11,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the statistics of the corpus that consists of 300 authors for each of the two languages, English and Spanish. For each author, we retrieved via the Twitter API her last 200 tweets. The corpus for each language is completely balanced, with 150 authors for each class (hate and non-hate speech spreaders), as well as by the number of tweets per user. We have split the corpus into training and test sets, following a proportion of 2/3 for training and the rest for test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Performance Measure</head><p>The performance of the systems has been ranked by accuracy. For each language, we calculated individual accuracy for discriminating between the two classes. Finally, we averaged the accuracy values per language to obtain the final ranking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Baselines</head><p>As baselines to compare the performance of the participants with, we have selected:</p><p>• Character 𝑛-grams with 𝑛 ranging from 2 to 6 and Logistic Regression;</p><p>• Word 𝑛-grams with 𝑛 ranging from 1 to 3 and SVM;</p><p>• Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to feed a BiLSTM with;</p><p>• XLM-Roberta (XLMR) transformer to feed a BiLSTM with;</p><p>• Multilingual BERT (MBERT) transformer to feed a BiLSTM with;</p><p>• TFIDF vectors representing each user's text to feed a BiLSTM with.</p><p>• LDSE <ref type="bibr" coords="5,143.13,86.97,16.09,10.91" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This method represents documents on the basis of the probability distribution of occurrence of their words in the different classes. The key concept of LDSE is a weight, representing the probability of a term to belong to one of the different categories: HS vs. non-HS spreader. The distribution of weights for a given document should be closer to the weights of its corresponding category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Software Submissions</head><p>Similar to previous year <ref type="foot" coords="5,198.39,188.57,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> , we asked for software submissions. Within software submissions, participants submit executables of their author profiling software instead of just the output of their software on a given test set. For the software submissions, the TIRA experimentation platform was employed <ref type="bibr" coords="5,194.44,230.97,16.31,10.91" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,213.33,230.97,12.23,10.91" target="#b44">45]</ref>, which renders the handling of software submissions at scale as simple as handling run submissions. Using TIRA, participants deploy their software on virtual machines at our site, which allows us to keep them in a running state <ref type="bibr" coords="5,401.05,258.07,16.25,10.91" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Overview of the Submitted Approaches</head><p>This year, 66 teams participated in the author profiling shared task and 32 of them submitted the notebook paper. We analyse their approaches from three perspectives: preprocessing, features used to represent the authors' texts and classification approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>With the aim at preventing bias towards some URLs, user mentions or hashtags, the corpus was provided with these elements already masked. In the same vein, some participants cleaned other Twitter-specific elements such as RT, VIA, and FAV <ref type="foot" coords="5,336.86,417.74,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref>   <ref type="bibr" coords="5,236.43,473.69,16.44,10.91" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,255.59,473.69,12.55,10.91" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,270.87,473.69,12.55,10.91" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,286.14,473.69,12.33,10.91" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Finally, some users got rid of short texts <ref type="bibr" coords="5,486.85,473.69,16.27,10.91" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, stemmed or lemmatised <ref type="bibr" coords="5,193.84,487.24,16.30,10.91" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,212.01,487.24,12.50,10.91" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,226.38,487.24,12.50,10.91" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,240.75,487.24,13.95,10.91" target="#b49">50]</ref> and tokenised <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.55,487.24,16.30,10.91" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,336.72,487.24,13.95,10.91" target="#b49">50]</ref> the tweets. Alcañiz and Andrés <ref type="bibr" coords="5,488.23,487.24,17.75,10.91" target="#b52">[53]</ref> expanded contractions and colloquial tokens (e.g., in Spanish, "x" was expanded to "por", and "k" to "que"), as well as Huertas-García et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,298.87,514.34,18.07,10.91" target="#b47">[48]</ref> who also considered slang words. Some participants carried out statistical analysis with preprocessing purposes. For instance, t-SNE has been used by Finogeev et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,230.85,541.44,17.75,10.91" target="#b60">[61]</ref> and Ceron and Casula <ref type="bibr" coords="5,349.28,541.44,16.09,10.91" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. These last authors also applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Finally, Ikae <ref type="bibr" coords="5,283.33,554.99,17.91,10.91" target="#b62">[63]</ref> used TFIDF and shift graphs <ref type="bibr" coords="5,432.72,554.99,16.25,10.91" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p></div>

This higher number of false positives, mainly in the case of Spanish, is something to be investigated further in future research. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In The error analysis shows that the highest confusion in both languages is towards Hate Speech Spreaders (false positives), although the proportion with respect to false negatives in Spanish (28.13% vs. 16.85%) is much higher than in English (39.23% vs. 34.20%).</p><p>Looking at the results and the error analysis, we can conclude that: (i) it is feasible to automatically identify potential Hate Speech Spreaders on Twitter with high precision, even when only textual features are used; but (ii) we have to bear in mind false positives since especially in Spanish, they are almost double than false negatives, and misclassification might lead to ethical or legal implications <ref type="bibr" coords="12,247.97,127.61,16.25,10.91" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="9,89.29,321.80,240.01,8.93;9,89.29,84.19,416.69,225.04"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Density of the results in the different languages.</figDesc><graphic coords="9,89.29,84.19,416.69,225.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The participants had to discriminate on Twitter between HS and non-HS spreaders. The provided data cover the English and Spanish languages. The participants used different features to address the task, mainly: (i) 𝑛-grams; (ii) stylistics; (iii) personality and emotions; and (iv) deep learning-based representations such as embeddings and mainly transformers. Concerning machine learning algorithms, the most used ones were Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression, as well as ensembles of several algorithms. Nevertheless, few participants approached the task with only deep learning techniques. In such cases, they used Fully-Connected Neural Networks, RNN, CNN, LSTM and Bi-LSTM. According to the results and unlike previous years, the combination of traditional machine learning methods such as SVM or Logistic Regression with novel deep learning-based representations such as BERT and its variations have obtained the highest results. The best results have been obtained in Spanish (0.85) by Siino et al. [66] with a 100-dimension word embedding representation to feed a Convolutional Neural Network. The best result in English (0.75) has been obtained by Dukić and Sović [60] with BERT and Logistic Regression. The overall best result (0.79) has been obtained by the first team.</figDesc></figure>
