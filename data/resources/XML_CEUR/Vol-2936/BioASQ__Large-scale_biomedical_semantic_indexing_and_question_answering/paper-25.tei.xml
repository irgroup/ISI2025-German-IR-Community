<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The global response to COVID-19 has yielded thousands of new scientific articles about COVID-19 and other related topics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,214.37,415.05,11.48,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,228.99,415.05,7.65,10.91" target="#b1">2]</ref>. The COVID-19 outbreak has emphasized the need for sophisticated systems that enable querying large volumes of scientific articles to find answers to questions expressed in natural language. Therefore, to provide information seekers with relevant and precise information about COVID-19, more sophisticated and specialized tools are needed <ref type="bibr" coords="1,123.31,469.25,11.26,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,137.29,469.25,7.50,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Question Answering (QA), aiming at answering natural language questions from textual documents, is a potential approach that could help information seekers to identify the precise information readily <ref type="bibr" coords="1,212.85,496.34,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,226.93,496.34,7.47,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,237.13,496.34,7.47,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,247.33,496.34,7.57,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>This paper presents the participation of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) team in BioASQ 1 Task Synergy on Biomedical Semantic QA for COVID-19. For given COVID-19 related questions, this task aims at (1) retrieving the relevant documents, (2) retrieving the most relevant passages, and (3) extracting/generating the exact and ideal answers from a corpus of scientific articles. To address these problems, we exploited natural language processing techniques and pre-trained language models for document retrieval, passage retrieval, and answer extraction/generation. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,262.18,417.83,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the pipeline of our proposed QA system. We first index the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and retrieve the top-n relevant documents for each question using BM25 as a retrieval model. We then re-rank the retrieved documents using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) relevance-based re-ranking model, and select the top-k documents. Once the 𝑘 top-ranked documents are retrieved, we then retrieve the relevant passages using T5 as a re-ranker model. We finally extract and generate the "ideal answers" (i.e., a paragraph-sized summary of relevant information,) using T5 and BART models.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most relevant prior work and describes the datasets used in BioASQ Task Synergy. Section 3 presents our systems for document retrieval, passage retrieval, and "ideal answer" extraction/generation. Official results for all models are presented in Section 4. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>• Document Retrieval: Neural-based models have shown promising results in a variety of IR tasks. Xiong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.62,639.05,12.84,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> developed a kernel pooling technique by customizing word embeddings that learn to encode the relevance preferences. This approach was further enhanced by Dai et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.91,666.15,17.91,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> who proposed a convolutional model to consider n-gram representations of the word. Traditional models, such as BM25 and query likelihood are known to be successful retrieval models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,317.20,100.52,16.41,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These models are based on the exact matching of query and document words, which might limit the available information for the ranking model, which, in turn, may lead to a vocabulary mismatch issue. Models for statistical translation have tried to overcome this limitation. They model the relevance of query documents with a pre-computed translation matrix describing the similarities between word pairs. Zamani et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,272.75,168.26,17.91,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> accentuated the effectiveness of neural ranking models and developed a neural model to retrieve documents from a very large dataset.</p><p>Recently, the pre-trained Transformer models (such as BERT) have also demonstrated their efficacy in ranking tasks. Nogueira and Cho <ref type="bibr" coords="3,349.66,208.91,17.91,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that the BERT model was highly effective in the passage re-ranking task on the MS-MARCO and TREC CAR <ref type="bibr" coords="3,116.56,236.01,17.96,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> datasets. MacAvaney et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,258.47,236.01,16.26,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Yang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,330.53,236.01,17.91,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> utilized the BERT model to predict the answer spans for a given question. Other studies have also explored BERT-based representations for document ranking. • Extractive Summarization: The recent progress in the development of neural models and pre-trained Transformer models has led to significant growth in extractive document summarization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,212.30,303.75,16.31,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The majority of the existing summarization models are built upon sequence-to-sequence frameworks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,298.42,317.30,16.41,10.91" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,317.56,317.30,12.54,10.91" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,332.82,317.30,12.31,10.91" target="#b19">20]</ref>, recurrent neural networks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,471.64,317.30,16.41,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,490.77,317.30,12.31,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>,</p><p>and Transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,201.10,330.85,16.55,10.91" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.81,330.85,12.42,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Cheng and Lapata <ref type="bibr" coords="3,328.25,330.85,17.91,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Nallapati et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,438.89,330.85,17.91,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> developed approaches that aim to decide whether a given sentence will qualify for the summary or not. Nallapati et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,204.26,357.95,17.91,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed SummaRuNNer that adds more lexical features to the sequence-to-sequence model. First, SummaRuNNer predicts the extraction probability score for each sentence, and then it performs sentence selection to select the top sentences for the summary. Chen and Bansal <ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.22,398.60,17.91,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> followed a similar line of study and exploited the pointer generator network to sequentially select sentences from the document to generate a summary. Other decoding techniques, such as ranking <ref type="bibr" coords="3,367.33,425.70,16.18,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, have also been utilized for content selection. Recently, several studies have explored pre-trained language models in summarization for contextual word representations <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.58,452.79,16.43,10.91" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,367.74,452.79,12.32,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref>. • Abstractive Summarization: The availability of large-scale training data has boosted the development of abstractive summarization techniques in the open domain. Rush et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,139.76,493.44,17.91,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> proposed a sequence-to-sequence model with attention for abstractive sentence summarization. Later, Li et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.29,506.99,17.91,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> utilized the sequence-to-sequence models in multisentence document summarization. Nallapati et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,344.90,520.54,17.91,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> utilized the copy-mechanism to generate or copy words either from the source document or vocabulary. See et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.07,534.09,17.91,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> introduced the coverage mechanism in the pointer generator network to generate nonhallucinated summaries. Few other works <ref type="bibr" coords="3,303.81,561.19,16.36,10.91" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,322.89,561.19,13.99,10.91" target="#b32">33]</ref> have proposed different techniques to generate factually-correct summaries. Studies conducted by Falke et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,435.61,574.74,16.25,10.91" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, Kryściński et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,141.96,588.29,16.29,10.91" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.74,588.29,17.91,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref> have utilized the natural language inference and question answering tasks to obtain factually-correct summaries. Other methods <ref type="bibr" coords="3,427.40,601.84,16.31,10.91" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.42,601.84,12.50,10.91" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.62,601.84,12.50,10.91" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,476.83,601.84,12.50,10.91" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,492.03,601.84,13.95,10.91" target="#b40">41]</ref> based on reinforcement learning (RL) were developed to improve the quality of the generated summaries. Pasunuru and Bansal <ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.97,628.93,17.91,10.91" target="#b37">[38]</ref> proposed RL-based optimization on the modified version of the ROUGE score that considers readability. Zhang and Bansal <ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.07,642.48,17.91,10.91" target="#b38">[39]</ref> addressed the semantic drift issue in question generation, proposing question-paraphrase and question-answering probability rewards. Yadav et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.06,669.58,17.91,10.91" target="#b41">[42]</ref> introduced question-focus and question-type based semantic rewards that enforce the model to generate semantically valid and factually correct question summaries. Recently, abstractive summarization was used for the summarization of various medical and clinical texts, such as radiology reports <ref type="bibr" coords="4,312.85,127.49,16.47,10.91" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,332.05,127.49,12.56,10.91" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,347.33,127.49,12.35,10.91" target="#b43">44]</ref>, consumer health questions and medical answers <ref type="bibr" coords="4,193.00,141.04,16.43,10.91" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,212.16,141.04,12.55,10.91" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,227.43,141.04,12.55,10.91" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.71,141.04,12.55,10.91" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,257.98,141.04,12.32,10.91" target="#b48">49]</ref>, and biomedical documents <ref type="bibr" coords="4,398.82,141.04,16.25,10.91" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</p></div>

BM25 algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="4,206.68,220.51,17.76,10.91" target="#b50">[51]</ref> is a bag-of-words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document. The BM25 score between a query term 𝑄 = {𝑤 1 , 𝑤 2 , . . . , 𝑤 𝑛 } and document 𝐷 is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,155.74,268.78,350.25,34.99">Score(𝐷, 𝑄) = 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 IDF(𝑤 𝑖 ) • 𝑓 (𝑤 𝑖 , 𝐷) • (𝑘 1 + 1) 𝑓 (𝑤 𝑖 , 𝐷) + 𝑘 1 • (1 -𝑏 + 𝑏 • |𝐷| avgdl )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where 𝑓 (𝑤 𝑖 , 𝐷) is 𝑤 𝑖 's term frequency in the document 𝐷, |𝐷| is the length of the document (in words), and 𝑎𝑣𝑔𝑑𝑙 is the average document length in the document set. 𝑘 1 and 𝑏 are the hyperparamerts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)</head><p>. This is a pre-trained model developed by Raffel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,115.27,455.84,17.91,10.91" target="#b51">[52]</ref> who explored the transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. This approach is inspired by previous unifying frameworks for NLP tasks, including casting all text problems as question answering <ref type="bibr" coords="4,262.74,496.49,18.07,10.91" target="#b52">[53]</ref> or language modeling <ref type="bibr" coords="4,388.95,496.49,16.42,10.91" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The T5 model is an Encoder-Decoder Transformer with some architectural changes discussed in detail in Raffel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,113.33,523.59,16.25,10.91" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART).</head><p>BART <ref type="bibr" coords="4,410.42,552.23,17.78,10.91" target="#b54">[55]</ref> is a denoising autoencoder built with a sequence-to-sequence model. Due to its bidirectional encoder and left-to-right decoder, it can be considered as generalizing BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,368.86,579.33,17.78,10.91" target="#b55">[56]</ref> and GPT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,430.49,579.33,16.10,10.91" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, respectively. BART pretraining has two stages: (1) a noising function is used to corrupt the input text, and</p><p>(2) a sequence-to-sequence model is learned to reconstruct the original input text.</p></div>

T5 with traditional Transformer architecture and BERT's masked language modeling <ref type="bibr" coords="5,316.08,141.16,16.09,10.91" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, was shown to be effective on newswire retrieval and MS MARCO <ref type="bibr" coords="5,205.06,154.71,16.15,10.91" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. In contrast to BERT that is pre-trained on a Masked LM (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective and then, fine-tuned on specific tasks, the T5 model casts all natural language processing tasks (e.g. natural language inference, question answering) into a text-to-text format. We adopted the T5 approach to document re-ranking by using the following input sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,205.87,236.01,300.11,10.91">𝑄𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 : 𝑞 𝐷𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 : 𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 :<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The T5 model was fine-tuned on (1) MS MARCO passage ranking dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="5,424.91,256.03,17.80,10.91" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and (2) TREC-COVID <ref type="foot" coords="5,122.01,267.83,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> dataset by maximizing the log probability of generating the output token "true" when the document is relevant, and the token "false" when the document is not relevant to the query <ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.29,296.68,16.41,10.91" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Once fine-tuned, we first apply a softmax only on the logits of the "true" and "false" generated tokens, and then re-rank the documents using the probabilities of the "true" token. More details about this approach appear in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,283.01,323.78,16.25,10.91" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Passage Retrieval</head><p>The passage retrieval task at BioASQ Synergy consists of retrieving a set of at most 10 relevant text passages/snippets (𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , ..., 𝑝 10 ) from the abstracts or titles of the documents returned by the document retrieval method. To address this problem, we used the T5 relevance-based re-ranking model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,170.72,414.15,18.03,10.91" target="#b51">[52]</ref> that we also used for document re-ranking. To do so, we first split the abstracts of the documents retrieved for a given question into sentences/chunks (i.e. passages) using NLTK <ref type="foot" coords="5,144.39,439.50,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> , and then ranked these passages based on the relevance score that determined how relevant a candidate passage was to the question. The passages were ranked by a pointwise re-ranker that used T5. We adapted the T5 approach presented in the previous section (cf. Section 3.2) to passage re-ranking by using the following input sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,208.26,509.00,297.72,10.91">𝑄𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 : 𝑞 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 : 𝑆 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 :<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We first applied a softmax only on the logits of the "true" and "false"tokens generated by T5 that was fine-tuned on MS MARCO and TREC-COVID datasets. We then re-ranked the passages/snippets using the probabilities of the "true" tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Ideal Answer Generation</head><p>The "ideal answer" is defined as a single paragraph-sized text summarizing the most relevant information from the passages. To generate the ideal answer for a given question in BioASQ Synergy, we explored extractive and abstractive summarization approaches based on pretrained language models. 1. Extractive approach. We formed the ideal answer to a question by rejoining the selected top-3 passages returned for the passage retrieval task by the T5 relevance-based re-ranking model. 2. Abstractive approach. We utilized the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,493.30,165.83,12.69,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to fine-tune the BART model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Additional Datasets</head><p>Document and passage retrieval. For the document and passage retrieval tasks, we used the following datasets to fine-tune the T5 model:</p><p>• MS MARCO Passage <ref type="bibr" coords="6,223.42,295.26,18.07,10.91" target="#b57">[58]</ref> is a large dataset for passage ranking. It contains 8.8M passages retrieved by the Bing search engine for around 1M natural language questions. • TREC-COVID <ref type="bibr" coords="6,189.50,323.71,18.07,10.91" target="#b58">[59]</ref> is a large test collection created to evaluate ad-hoc retrieval of documents relevant to COVID-19 <ref type="foot" coords="6,265.59,335.51,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">5</ref> .</p></div>

These scientific papers are processed to remove the duplicate entries and collect the relevant metadata. The rich collection of these structured data is used to develop the text-mining and information retrieval systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>The performance of the document retrieval and passage retrieval systems was evaluated using the typical evaluation measures used in information retrieval: mean precision, mean recall, mean F-measure, mean average precision (MAP) and geometric mean average precision (GMAP). The ideal answers were automatically evaluated using ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4. Detailed descriptions of these evaluation metrics appear in <ref type="bibr" coords="6,317.02,538.82,16.40,10.91" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.

NLM-5 : We first fine-tuned T5 on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset and then TREC-COVID. We considered a chunk of two sentences as a passage length. The results obtained by our submissions and the best participants' results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="8,115.19,517.33,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In terms of MAP and GMAP, our NLM-1 run achieved the best performance among our submissions on all testing batches. NLM-3 achieves the best recall and F1 scores on all batches. We note that the NLM-2 run in batch #1 is similar to the NLM-3 in batch #2, #3, and #4. The results showed that the passage length has an impact on the performance of our passage retrieval models. As in the document retrieval task, we found that the in-domain dataset (TREC-COVID) did not improve the performance for the passage retrieval task.</p></div>

In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In-silico studies were carried out to understand the role of its bioactive constituents in COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Firstly, the disease network was prepared by using ACE2 (Angiotensin-II receptor), as it is the entry site for virus.</p><p>Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor for ligands that affect developmental axonal growth and angiogenesis. In addition to a role in cancer, neuropilins, heparan sulfate and sialic acids and the putative alternative receptors, such as CD147 and GRP78, are reported entry points for several viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 What Covid-19 viral protein or proteins do the vaccines target?</p><p>Our study proposes a detailed and comprehensive immunoinformatic approach that can be applied to the currently available coronavirus protein data in the online server for vaccine candidate development. We have identified the receptor binding domain (RBD) of structural spike protein (S1) as a potential target for immunity against COVID-19 infection. To develop vaccine, we target S-protein, expressed on the virus surface plays important role in COVID-19 infection. We identified 12 B-cell, 9 T-helper and 20 Cytotoxic T-cell epitope based on criteria of selection.</p><p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 7,000,000 infections and 400,000 deaths worldwide to date. A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric class I fusion protein that mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study, immunoinformatics approach was employed to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine using receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S re-ranking model for document and passage retrieval. We also exploited T5 and BART for extracting and generating "ideal answers". The official results show that our models achieve strong performance compared to the participants' systems. We found that augmenting the training data with relevance judgments obtained from related TREC-COVID tasks did not improve the performance of our systems in the passage retrieval task. We also found that extractive summarization performed better than abstractive summarization for the generation of ideal answers. In the future, we would like to explore suitable datasets and techniques for abstractive summarization to improve the performance of the ideal answer generation task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,89.29,380.23,166.92,8.93;2,112.14,84.19,368.50,283.48"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The pipeline of our QA system</figDesc><graphic coords="2,112.14,84.19,368.50,283.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
