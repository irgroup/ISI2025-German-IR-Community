<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we present approaches for our participation in the 9th BioASQ challenge (Task b -Phase B). Our systems are based on the transformer models with model-centric and data-centric approaches. For factoid-type questions we modified the dataset to increase label consistency, and for list-type questions we apply the sequence tagging model which is a more natural model design for the multi-label task. Our experimental results suggest two main points: better model design can be achieved by reflecting data characteristics such as the number of labels for a data point; and scarce resources such as BioQA datasets can greatly benefit from a data-centric approach with relatively little effort. Our submissions achieve competitive results with top or near top performance in the challenge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Question answering (QA) is the task of finding information about the given question from the given document. Biomedical question answering (BioQA) is a specific category of QA tasks where questions and/or the related documents, namely passages, are in the context of the biomedical domain.</p><p>BioASQ <ref type="bibr" coords="1,138.78,480.60,12.99,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> challenge is a large-scale annual competition for biomedical literature, which encompasses document classification, document retrieval, and QA tasks, and is a one of the richest source for BioQA research. Questions of the challenge are categorized in 4 categories: Factoid-type, List-type, Yes/No-type, and Summary-type questions. Answers of QA tasks are in two formats: exact answer and ideal answer. For an exact answer, the output of the model is  a word or a short phrase, whereas, for an ideal answer, the output should be one or multiple sentences. Participants can choose to answer both formats or partially.</p><p>In this paper, we provide approaches of our participation in QA tasks of the challenge (Task 9b -Phase B) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,149.33,425.87,11.32,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Our submissions are in both exact and ideal answer formats. Our approaches vary from the type of questions and answers. For exact answers, we utilize both model-centric approach (list-type question) and data-centric approach (factoid-type question) to improve our previous systems <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.09,466.52,13.00,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for BioASQ 8b. For ideal answers, we apply abstractive summarization method using large-scale language model BART <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.26,480.07,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>In this section, we describe details of our approaches. In the Section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, we describe our approaches for the exact answers. In the Section 2.4, we describe our unified model for ideal answers, which can answer all four types of questions: 3 aforementioned types and summarytype questions. For all types, we mainly fine-tune BioBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,358.52,579.28,11.52,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which has been proven to be effective on various NLP tasks in the biomedical or clinical domain <ref type="bibr" coords="2,389.38,592.83,11.36,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,403.46,592.83,7.47,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,413.66,592.83,7.47,10.91" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,423.86,592.83,7.47,10.91" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.06,592.83,12.55,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,449.33,592.83,12.32,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p></div>

BioQA models have also benefited from transfer-learning <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,86.97,11.33,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,103.35,86.97,12.54,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,118.62,86.97,12.30,10.91" target="#b15">16]</ref>. However, utilizing the maximum of scarce resources is susceptible to the rare error of the training samples, as opposed to relatively rich datasets where a few erroneous samples can be ignored by the model. Moreover, Jeong et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,321.40,114.06,12.84,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> measured the proportion of questions, which is unanswerable if transformed to the extractive QA setting, in the test dataset of BioASQ 8b. Hence, the models trying to solve the task under the extractive QA setting are suffering from unexpected noise.</p><p>In this section, we introduce our data-centric approach for factoid-type questions of the BioASQ 9b challenge. Data-centric approach is a concept of improving the quality of training data to make it better fit into the model. The term data-centric forms a binary opposition term pair with model-centric approach which focuses more into improving model to achieve better performance. The concept is introduced by Ng <ref type="bibr" coords="3,332.25,222.46,17.91,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref> at a seminar, where he argued the benefit of data-centric approaches and showed that, for some datasets, larger improvements in performance can be made with data-centric approach than model-centric approach.</p><p>Our main aim of data-centric approach is to increase labeling consistency and exclude or clean noisy data points. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,227.70,276.66,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and 2 shows the data cleaning operations and the examples of them. The answers from the BioASQ 9b training samples are mostly in the format of noun phrases. However, some data points have answers in sentences format. We manually modify such sentence answers to a noun phrase format. Additional normalization processes are made to correct misspelled word and to remove punctuation marks. Word correction and minor normalization processes are made to the questions. We do not modify grammatical structure of the questions and we count both British and American spelling as correct.</p><p>152 changes are made to the 9b training dataset including 22 question corrections and 24 dropped data points. For the evaluation of our models, we do not apply normalization steps. Data cleaning resources are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/bioasq9b-dmis .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model-centric approach; List Questions</head><p>Extractive question answering is a task of finding answer spans of a question in the given passage. List-type questions are questions with multiple answers whereas factoid questions are questions that can be answered with one phrase. For list-type question, the number of answer for a given question is uninformed (i.e. not available as a metadata). Hence, deciding it remains a challenging and key operation to participating systems.</p><p>Previous works utilize factoid models with an additional steps to decide the number of answers for the questions. Factoid models are designed to predict a single answer span, and thus, they can not be trained on multi-label setup directly. In other words, for a training data point of list-type question, one answer span is trained for a training step and the other answers are acting as a noise since they are considered as non-answer tokens. We call this setting as "start-end span prediction", which is commonly used in biomedical extractive QA <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.72,583.82,11.36,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,467.80,583.82,12.55,10.91" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,483.08,583.82,12.32,10.91" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Following the approach of Yoon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,276.51,597.37,16.29,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, our systems for list-type questions are based on the sequence tagging approach. Specifically, a question and its corresponding passage are concatenated to construct a sequence, which is a training data point. Our systems adopt either BIO or IO scheme to annotate answer spans. For each tokens in the passage is tagged as B, I, or O tag which stands for Beginning, Inside, Outside, respectively.</p><p>Sequence tagging approach has two significant benefits over the previous models. model can be trained on multiple answers simultaneously which is more natural model design for the multi-answer task. As all available training labels (i.e. answers) are used for the training, rather than acting as training noise, the model learn the maximum of the dataset. Second, the approach is an end-to-end model that finds all the answers in the passage, whereas the previous models require complex post-processing steps to decide the number of answers. Models for the previous BioASQ challenges <ref type="bibr" coords="4,239.41,339.91,11.48,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,254.21,339.91,14.11,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref> decided the number of answers by threshold-based answer decision process, where the threshold value is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned. Additionally, rule-based answer number detection are adopted under the assumption that if the numeric value exists in the question, the value is highly likely to be the required number of answers (ex. Question: List 3 apoE mimetics). In contrast, our approach does not require additional hyperparameter searching nor have to rely on the weak assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Yes/No Questions</head><p>Following the systems of our participation for BioASQ 8b <ref type="bibr" coords="4,356.67,457.32,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we use BioBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,454.61,457.32,12.99,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with an additional pre-training step on MNLI dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="4,285.37,470.87,16.09,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For BioASQ 9b task, our systems are based on BioBERT LARGE , which has more model parameters than BioBERT BASE model from the previous participation. For yes/no-type questions, we adjust the ratio of yes questions and no questions in the training set to 1:1. The original training dataset is heavily skewed towards question with yes answers. As shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,235.39,525.07,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, original 8b training set consists of 10,284 yes and 1,691 no question and passage pair samples. After our pre-processing steps, approximately 85.8% of answers for the yes/no-type questions are yes. Our systems are trained on the down-sampled training dataset to alleviate the class imbalance problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Ideal answers</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,121.84,615.39,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an overview of our approach for the ideal answers. Our model utilize the predicted exact answer as a input for generating a ideal answer. In detail, we generate all the combinations of triples of an exact answer (𝐴) and all the passages (𝑃 1 , . . . , 𝑃 𝑛 ) available for a question (𝑄). Then using the triples, we generate a candidate sentences (𝐶 1 , . . . , 𝐶 𝑛 ) for a question. We then select one ideal answer from the candidates using candidate selection process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Score Function</head><p>We have tried to score the generated ideal answer candidates (𝐶 1 , . . . , 𝐶 𝑛 ) by checking the presence of (candidate) exact answer(s). In order to check the presence, we employ BERN <ref type="bibr" coords="5,156.15,438.66,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a BioBERT based named entity recognition (NER) and linking system, to detect all the entities in the ideal answer candidates. For each candidate sentences for factoid and list questions, we calculate the F1-score using the tentative exact answer(s) and recognize entities from the candidate sentences. If one of the tentative answer(s) exists in the generated sentences, we add it to the set of recognized entities even if it is not detected by BERN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Syntax Checker</head><p>We use language-check python package<ref type="foot" coords="5,366.05,519.87,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , an automated syntax checker, to correct or filter out grammatically wrong candidate sentences. From the list of ideal answer candidates, we select one with the highest score and check it with the syntax checker. If grammar errors are detected, we try to correct it with the checker. However, if the checker finds impossible to fix it, we then skip the candidate and move to the second highest candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,116.70,634.44,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref> presents our experimental results on the factoid dataset. Owing to our data-centric approach (noisy data points exclusion and increasing label consistency), our model perfor- Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.45,364.90,5.16,10.91" target="#tab_4">5</ref> shows the experimental results on the list dataset for sequence tagging model and the baseline model, namely Start-End model <ref type="bibr" coords="6,289.37,378.45,15.38,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (for both full abstract and snippet datasets). Our model outperforms the baseline model, which we used for the last year, with large gap. Our model with IO tagging even outperforms the start-end model with snippet dataset as input without using complex post-processing and rule-based processing steps. Please note that snippets are more concentrated sources of information than the full abstract documents since the answer should exist in a snippet or a full abstract but a snippet is a sentence-length document whereas a full abstract is a paragraph-length document. In the challenge, we also submitted ensemble system, which consists of sequence tagging model and start-end model. However, ensemble system did not show significant improvement over single models.</p><p>For yes/no-type questions, we introduce the down-sampling method which we balance the number of yes and no questions from the training set by sampling 1,691 yes questions out of 10284 yes questions (i.e. sampled 16% of yes questions). We have empirically shown that a down-sampled dataset alleviates the underlying class imbalance issue of yes/no-type questions. The results of yes/no model trained on down-sampled and original training data are described in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,127.39,568.14,3.70,10.91" target="#tab_5">6</ref>. For models trained on down-sampled data, macro F1 score is improved from 0.80 to 0.93 (0.13 improvement). We have found that the down sampling method achieves better model performance for imbalanced yes/no-type questions. We conduct the experiments following the same hyperparameter settings, including learning rate and the number of learning steps.</p><p>The official evaluation metric for the ideal models is human evaluation score, which is scored by the human experts on the following four criteria: recall, precision, repetition, and readability. Since the human evaluation score is not yet released at the moment<ref type="foot" coords="6,383.13,647.68,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , we provide the qualitative  analysis of the model on Table <ref type="table" coords="7,232.09,495.09,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_6">7</ref>. As we denoted in Section 2.4, tentative exact answers are used as one of the inputs to generate ideal answer candidates and to select best candidates for the questions. By utilizing the exact answer as one of the input to the ideal answer generation model, the model is imposed to consider the given exact answer in the sentence generation step and potentially include the exact answer in the generated sentence. The examples in the Table <ref type="table" coords="7,501.27,549.29,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_6">7</ref> show that the generated ideal answer sentences successfully include the given exact answers (potential exact answers). We did not exclude the snippets that do not contain the exact answer since our model is expected to include the given exact answers in the generated sentences even if they dose not exist in the passage. Finally, Table <ref type="table" coords="7,162.24,617.03,5.09,10.91" target="#tab_7">8</ref> shows the result of our participation and the best performing system in the challenge. If our system scored the highest performance for a given batch, we marked it using bold font.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we report our participation with data-centric and model-centric approaches, and the results of our systems for the BioASQ 9b task. We introduce a data-centric approach for factoid-type questions, in which we train the model using the dataset with increased label consistency, and improves the performance of our model. For list-type questions, we apply the sequence tagging model and achieve better performance while at the same time lower the cost of pre-and post-processing. Furthermore, for yes/no-type questions in the BioASQ 9b, our models have shown the best performance by utilizing down-sampling.
