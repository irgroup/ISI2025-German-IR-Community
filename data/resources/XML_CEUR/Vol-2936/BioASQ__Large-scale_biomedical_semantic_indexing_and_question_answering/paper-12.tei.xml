<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In January 2020 the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) declared the 2019 corona virus as a global health emergency. More than one year later, and even with the existence of vaccines, the virus still affects the majority of the world population. Furthermore, studies are still being conducted and new material about the virus is published every day. This causes a wave of knowledge, firstly available through scientific articles, which without effective searching tools ends up deprecating precious research time. So, it becomes imperative to improve the access to this type of unstructured information in order to foster further research about the novel corona virus.</p><p>TREC was the first institution to launch a global challenge, TREC-Covid <ref type="bibr" coords="1,435.25,498.93,11.58,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, to push the research on search tools for dealing with the exponential growth of the literature about the novel corona virus. The BioASQ organization followed the same path and launched the Synergy task, where the aim is to retrieve the most relevant answers to biomedical questions about this corona virus.</p><p>This paper describes the participation of the Biomedical Informatics and Techologies (BIT) group of the Aveiro University in the Synergy challenge, which consisted in retrieving, from the CORD-19 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.28,86.97,12.94,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> collection, documents and snippets that are relevant for a given biomedical question related to the novel corona virus.</p><p>Our approach builds on the lessons learned from our participation in the TREC-Covid challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="2,117.58,127.61,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In TREC-Covid, due to the nature of the residual evaluation, we observed that relevance feedback approaches drastically benefit from this setup. So, we decided to constructed a strong baseline based on relevance feedback techniques and then tried to rerank this to achieve further improvements.</p><p>We achieved satisfying results with our simple approach, losing only to the first place team. In the remaining of the paper we describe in more detail our relevance feedback approach. We then describe the submissions and the results obtained, followed by a general discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Relevance Feedback</head><p>In this section, to make the paper self-contained, we first made a briefly introduction to the topic of relevance feedback, a well known technique studied in the field of information retrieval in which the main idea is to directly include the user feedback into the retrieval process. In other words, the user will refine the quality of the results by selecting positives example from the initial retrieval order. With more detail, the basic procedure of relevance feedback can be summarize by the following steps:</p><p>1. A simple query, encoding the information need, is processed by the system. 2. The results are returned to the user. 3. From that initial list, the user selects some positive and negatives examples. The main concern when implementing a relevance feedback algorithm regards creating a new representation of the information need from the original query, positives and negatives examples. Following the literature, the most well known method is the Rocchio <ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.73,482.17,13.00,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> algorithm. This algorithm operates in the vector space model, where document and queries are represented as vectors. The main idea is to produce a new query vector by combining the original query vector, plus a weighted representation of the positive documents minus a weighted representation of the negative documents. Then the retrieval is done by projecting the new query to the vector space and retrieving by cosine similarity the closest documents. The intuition is to modify the original query in order to move it closer to the positive examples and farther away from the negative examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section we describe our main solution, consisting of a combination of BM25 with relevance feedback, and explain the intuition behind this approach. To better understand our rational, we first analyze the format of the Synergy task.</p><p>The Synergy task appeared as an effort to help finding answers to biomedical questions about the 2019 novel coronavirus. Unlike the usual BioASQ format, the Synergy task presented a fundamental change concerning its evaluation and flow. More precisely, the Synergy task followed a residual type of evaluation, similar to TREC-Covid, where the test set is reused through all the batches. Additionally, in between batches the golden feedback data, i.e., the relevance information for each question, was made available to the participants. This ends up changing the usual retrieval paradigm, in which one is expected to apply a retrieval system on an unknown question. So, according to the literature, the Synergy tasks becomes suitable to relevance feedback techniques, since some relevant examples were available for a majority of the questions, which satisfies the points 2 and 3 of the relevance feedback procedure. This observation can be confirmed by the TREC-Covid challenge results, where relevance feedback runs were able to achieve top scoring positions, outscoring traditional, neural and transformer based retrieval approaches.</p><p>Based on these observations and also inspired by our previous submission to the TREC-Covid challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.02,276.66,11.28,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we adopted the traditional BM25 ranking function combined with a simple relevance feedback method for constructing a strong baseline for this challenge. Then, we also tried to employ our existing BioASQ 8b neural ranking model to further rerank our baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Baseline -BM25 with Relevance Feedback</head><p>As previously mentioned, we adopted the BM25 ranking function as our retrieval function, since it is known to produce close to state of the art results when well fine-tuned. In order to include relevance feedback in the BM25 algorithm, we follow a similar intuition from the Rocchio algorithm of adding a representation of the positive documents to the query. However, since the BM25 is a probabilistic model and not a vector model, we employed a query expansion technique based on the most representatives terms of each positive document. This new query is then processed by the BM25, hopefully returning a new list of documents that are more similar to the positive documents.</p><p>The representative terms of each document were selected as the top-ð terms with higher tf-idf score. The intuition behind this assumption is that the terms with higher tf-idf score will largely contribute to the final ranking score. Thus by including them in the new query we are boosting the documents that are most similar, in terms of tf-idf terms, to our positives examples. After selecting the ð most important terms from the collection of positive examples, these are added to the original query in an disjunctive form. Then the normal BM25 ranking function is applied over this new generated query. The overall procedure of relevance feedback is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,131.96,127.61,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Impact of the Source of Relevance</head><p>Another important detail is the source of positive examples that we feed as feedback data. For that there are two alternatives, the text from the list of positive documents <ref type="bibr" coords="4,416.43,189.97,11.34,10.91" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and the text from the list of positive snippets <ref type="bibr" coords="4,210.35,203.52,10.36,10.91" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. In order to chose the best candidate we performed an empirical evaluation using the first round feedback data. More precisely, we performed a 60% random split of the questions, resulting in 60 queries for validation and 41 queries for testing. The validation set was used to finetune the relevance feedback and BM25 parameters, and the final results are reported over the test set. The parameters that were finetuned were the ð1 and ð parameters for BM25, the number of terms to add to the query, ð, the maximum number of positive samples per question, ð ððð¥ , and minimum frequency for the query expansion, ð¹ ððð . Additionally, we also finetuned a boost parameter that multiplies the contribution of the original query terms with respect to the added terms. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,266.92,311.91,5.17,10.91">1</ref> shows the range and best value for the parameters.</p><p>For both experiments we first used random search over a large space of parameters and then proceeded with grid search that best fit each experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Set of parameters that were finetuned. In bold we report the best values found for the second round of the BioASQ-Synergy. The notation { X to Y, Z} means that we search between X and Y in Z increments. In Table <ref type="table" coords="4,140.34,471.34,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we show the performance of the best and worst set of parameters when using documents and snippets as a source of positive examples. From the experiment, it is clear that the list of snippets are far better candidates than the list of document to extract the most representatives terms to expand the query. We believe that this discrepancy is related to the scope hypothesis <ref type="bibr" coords="4,168.77,525.54,11.49,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, that says that a document can address several topics. This will result in the extraction of terms unrelated with the question topic, hence causing query drift.</p><p>Furthermore, the snippet hyper-parameter search is also more reliable, with a much smaller difference between the best and worst parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Neural Rerank</head><p>Since it is expected that neural reranking models will bring some improvements over traditional baselines, we also included some runs where we tried to rerank our baseline produced by the previous approach.</p><p>For this neural reranking, we relied on our neural architecture that was used in the BioASQ 8b challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="4,146.99,669.58,11.34,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Submission</head><p>In this section, we start by describing the data collection and some pre-processing steps. Then we detail each run that was submitted on each batch. Note that all the runs submitted and the results presented are with respect to the document retrieval task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Collection and Pre-processing</head><p>The Synergy task used the CORD-19 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,262.03,360.18,13.00,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> collection, which is a open collection of scientific articles about the 2019 novel coronavirus. Currently, it is updated on a weekly basis and has more than 550 thousand articles gathered from peer-reviewed publications and open archives such as bioRxiv and medRxiv. For the task, only documents that had pmid, abstract and title were considering, meaning that roughly 60% of the articles were discarded.</p><p>At each round we indexed the valid set of articles with Elasticsearch using the english text analyzer, which automatically performs tokenization, stemming and stopword filtering. Additionally, we also included an analyzer to perform expansion of Covid-19 related terms by using a synonym expansion list.</p><p>Regarding the neural ranking model, we kept the same model architecture described in the 2020 BioASQ 8b challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="5,225.90,495.67,11.48,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Additionally, we trained 200-dimensinal word embeddings using the GenSim <ref type="bibr" coords="5,170.38,509.22,12.75,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> implementation of word2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="5,315.35,509.22,11.34,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, with the combination of PUBMED plus CORD-19.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Runs</head><p>The first version of the Synergy task had four rounds, with no feedback data available for the first round. Therefore, we could not apply our relevance feedback baseline for the first round, and used instead a BM25 baseline with neural reranking.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,126.52,613.14,4.97,10.91">3</ref> presents the summary of all the submissions, where RF stands for relevance feedback and NN for reranking with a neural network that was trained on the feedback data, with NN (TREC-Covid) meaning that the neural network was trained with the trec-covid data and NN (BioASQ) meaning it was trained with the bioASQ data. Furthermore, BM25 was fine-tuned for Table <ref type="table" coords="6,116.06,90.49,5.12,8.93">3</ref> Summary of the submitted runs for each round of the 2020 BioASQ Task Synergy. RF: relevance feedback; NN: neural network reranking. each round and we set the parameter ð to 75, which means that a maximum of 75 new terms were added to the revised query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run name</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>The overall results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,262.83,308.86,3.77,10.91" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, together with the median of all submissions and the result of the top performing system in each batch. The results are organized according the Mean Average Precision at ten (MAP@10), which was the measure adopted by organizers to rank all the received submissions. There were a total of 20, 21, 23 and 24 submissions respectively for each round. When looking at the results presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,319.84,541.06,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, it is important to notice that the main method presented in this paper was only used in rounds 2, 3 and 4. Nonetheless, from the first round results it is possible to observe that the runs that used the TREC-Covid data resulted in the worst performance, below the normal baseline and the run trained with BioASQ Task b data. This is an interesting behavior, since the model that was trained with domain data (TREC-Covid) had worst performance against the model that was trained in a more generic domain (BioASQ). We theorize that this may be related to the differences in the query structure from TREC-Covid, also known as topics, and the more human like questions used in the Synergy task. Another aspect is related to the differences in terms of feedback data. More precisely, TREC-Covid has a very low number of questions but higher number of feedback documents per question, while BioASQ has a compatible larger number of queries and lower number of feedback documents per question.</p><p>Regarding rounds 2, 3 and 4 we achieved competitive performance taking into consideration the simple approach. Notably our best scores correspond to submissions that just used BM25 with relevance feedback, in round 2 and 4, which means that the neural reranking in those rounds lowered the overall performance. However, in round 3 our best performance was achieved with a reranking strategy, making it inconclusive if our reranking technique over the relevance feedback baseline is beneficial or detrimental. In terms of team ranking positions, our technique achieved two second places in rounds 2 and 4, scoring below the strong submissions of the first place team, as well as a third place in round 3. To get a better context of the overall performance in relation to all the submissions we show in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,130.70,439.23,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_3">2</ref> the difference in terms of MAP@10 of our best submissions against the median score presented in the leaderboards. Notably, the relevance feedback solution performed as expected and gave us a simple solution that managed to consistently achieve above average results.</p></div>
