<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We describe the fourth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2021 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting three tasks related to factuality, and it covers Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Spanish, and Turkish. Here, we present task 3, which focuses on multi-class fake news detection and topical domain detection of news articles. Overall, there were 88 submissions by 27 teams for Task 3A, and 49 submissions by 20 teams for task 3B (two team from Task 3A and seven teams from Task 3B are excluding from the ranking due to wrong submission file). The best performing system for task 3A achieved a macro F1-score of 0.84 and was ahead of the rest by a rather large margin. The performance of the systems for task 3B was overall higher than for task 3A with the top performing system achieving a macro F1-score of 0.88. In this paper, we describe the process of data collection and the task setup, including the evaluation measures used, and we give a brief overview of the participating systems. Last but not least, we release to the research community all data sets from the lab as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research in automatic classification of news articles with respect to their correctness and topical domain.</p></div>

A dataset addressing this facet of the problem has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.20,606.27,17.76,10.91" target="#b39">[40]</ref> with the Fakeddit corpus providing not only text but also images from Reddit. In another study, the author have analysed the spread of misinformation on the WhatsApp tiplines in the context of fact-checking <ref type="bibr" coords="2,477.83,633.36,17.91,10.91" target="#b40">[41]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Data Description</head><p>Fact-checking of claims made in news articles or social media is a time-consuming process, requiring substantial background knowledge on the claims' topic as well as sufficient experience and training on the task. To be able to provide data from a broad range of topics, we relied on the judgements of experts in the field, provided through relevant fact-checking services on their respective websites. An overview of the applied approach is given in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,425.82,496.61,5.03,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and described in more detail in the following sub-sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Crawling Fact-Checking Reports</head><p>In a first step, fact-checking websites were identified and analysed with regard to their respective structures. The published fact-checking reports differ substantially regarding format and content. Therefore, tailored crawlers and scrapers for each of the considered sites were necessary. The entire crawling process was based on the AMUSED framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,387.87,600.54,16.41,10.91" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. An overview of the respective websites and the data collected from each individual site can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,489.71,614.09,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>From each fact-checking report, we collected the claims together with the experts' judgement on the correctness of the respective claims as well as the links to the potential original sources of the claims, and if available, information on the type of the source (e. g. news article, social media posts, images) as well as the topical domain of the article. Some of the websites offered these details as metadata in JSON format using the ClaimReview-type defined by Schema.org. Even though the metadata was not always complete for claims coming from those reports, the link to the original source could be identified reliably. However, for fact-checking reports not providing corresponding metadata a manual check of the different links given in the reports was necessary as most links in fact-checking reports point to sources supporting the judgement on the claim's correctness and generally no clear position of the link to the claim's source could be identified. To keep the task manageable, only the first three links provided in each report was considered due to the observation that most of the time, one of these referred to the claim's source page.</p><p>Before conducting the manual source identification step, automatic filtering was applied, removing all claims stemming from social media posts or multimedia documents. These could be identified due to given source type information or the domains' given in the links. This left about 3,400 article candidates for manual checking of the more than 200,000 crawled fact-checking reports.</p><p>Besides the correct identification of the source for each entry, we also manually verified that the source was indeed an article and that the article was still available on the site, thus eliminating error pages or articles with different content than at the time of fact-checking. More than half of the article candidates were removed due to this filtering, resulting in a set of about 1,400 articles for the task. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Scraping Articles</head><p>For each of the remaining articles, title and text were extracted from the respective pages in an automatic scraping process. The multitude of different news websites did not allow for tailored scrapers. Hence we extracted h1-tags as titles and the content of p-tags as text, excluding content from footers.</p><p>To ensure high data quality, articles with missing titles or text were again checked manually. The same is true for articles with a text length below a threshold of 500 characters. These articles often were not extracted correctly, sitting behind a paywall, or removed in the short period between the annotation and extraction process. Whenever possible, we added the missing content manually; otherwise, the article was removed from the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Data Set for Task 3A</head><p>As described above, we relied on the judgements of fact-checking experts for task 3a. However, due to the heterogeneous labelling schemes of different fact-checking agencies (e.g., false: incorrect, inaccurate, misinformation), we did not provide the original labels. Instead, labels with a joint meaning were merged and sometimes grouped under a concept with a broader meaning, as described by <ref type="bibr" coords="5,203.85,599.28,16.43,10.91" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,223.00,599.28,12.32,10.91" target="#b43">44]</ref>. Some examples are given in the following table.</p><p>The participants were provided with a training data set consisting of 900 news articles, leaving 354 articles for testing. The statistics about the class distributions in the training and test data can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,189.04,639.93,3.78,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Besides a unique identifier for each article, only the title and text, as well as the class label, were provided. No further metadata was included. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,444.09,653.48,5.09,10.91">3</ref> shows some sample data. With merchants in Democrat-run cities boarding up their storefront windows, the possibility of serious urban violence is well understood. As horrific as that could get (ask anyone who lives in Minneapolis), the progressive fascists appear to have a plan in place to make it even worse: [...] false</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Data Set for Task 3B</head><p>A subset of 455 articles was annotated with their respective topic, based on information provided by the fact-checking services, a challenge being the variety of topics in the data set and thus small numbers of examples. Individual topics were grouped to broader topical domains including health, climate, economy, crime, elections, and education. Altogether, 318 articles were provided as training data, leaving 137 articles for testing. The respective class distributions are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,115.79,547.83,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref>.</p><p>The complete CT-FAN-21 corpus used for tasks 3A and 3B is available at Zenodo <ref type="bibr" coords="6,450.67,561.38,16.25,10.91" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Submissions and Results</head><p>In this section, we present an overview of all task submissions for tasks 3A and 3B. Overall, there were 88 submissions by 27 teams for Task 3A and 49 submissions by 20 teams for task 3B. Each participating group could submit up to five runs in both of the subtasks. After evaluation, we found that two teams from task 3A and seven teams from task 3B submitted files not matching the specified format, thus having been eliminated from the evaluation. In Tables <ref type="table" coords="7,456.07,264.27,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_4">5</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="7,483.55,264.27,5.17,10.91">6</ref> the best submission of each team for task 3A and 3B are given, respectively. Both tasks 3A and 3B are classification tasks; therefore we used accuracy and macro-F 1 score for evaluation, ranking systems by the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Multi-class fake news categorization of news articles</head><p>Most teams used deep learning models, and in particular, transformer architectures were applied successfully for the task. This task being a pilot, there have been no attempts to model knowledge with semantic technology, e.g., argument processing <ref type="bibr" coords="7,325.10,381.75,16.25,10.91" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>The best run for this task was submitted by team NoFake. They were ahead of the rest by a substantial margin and achieved a macro-F 1 score of 0.838. The team applied BERT and made extensive use of external resources. In particular, they downloaded collections of misinformation datasets from fact-checking sites as additional training data. The second best submission (team Saud) achieved a macro-F 1 score of 0.503. The team used lexical features, traditional weighting methods as features, and standard machine learning algorithms. Traditional approaches can still outperform deep learning models for this task.</p><p>Many teams used BERT and its newer variants, often without fine-tuning. The most popular model was RoBERTa, which was used by seven teams. Team MUCIC used a majority voting ensemble with three BERT variants <ref type="bibr" coords="7,247.63,517.24,16.14,10.91" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. The participating teams that used BERT had to tackle the issue of handling the length of the input: BERT and its variants have limitations for the length of the input. However, the length of texts in the CT-FAN-21 dataset, which consists of newspaper articles, is often longer. In most cases, heuristics were used for the selection of a part of the article text. Overall, most submissions achieved a macro-F 1 score below 0.5.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the different approaches is given in section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Topical domain identification of news articles</head><p>The performance of the systems for task 3B was overall higher than for task 3A. The three best submissions achieved a similar performance, and they all applied transformer-based architectures. The best submission, by team NITK_NLP, used an ensemble of three transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.42,661.81,16.20,10.91" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The second best submission (by team NoFake) and the third best submission (by team Nkovachevich) used BERT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion of the Approaches Used</head><p>The participants have used a large variety of resources and models. Machine learning and pre-trained deep models were applied most frequently. The good performance of deep learning models is in line with the results of other recent shared tasks in text classification on complex tasks like hate speech identification <ref type="bibr" coords="8,250.61,652.22,16.25,10.91" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, sexism detection <ref type="bibr" coords="8,350.62,652.22,17.91,10.91" target="#b62">[63]</ref> or sentiment analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="8,469.15,652.22,16.25,10.91" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Classification Approaches</head><p>Many teams have used deep learning models, and they have chosen in particular transformer architectures that have been successful on many classification tasks recently. There have been no attempts to model knowledge with so-called semantic technology (e.g. transforming text into triplets <ref type="bibr" coords="9,144.27,389.13,16.96,10.91" target="#b64">[65]</ref>) or to extract statements that could be checked against knowledge bases (e.g. argument retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="9,175.76,402.67,15.77,10.91" target="#b60">[61]</ref>). Such technologies could also be potentially useful as technology for detecting misinformation. Most teams applied neural network based transformers. They often relied on BERT and its newer variants. The most popular model used was RoBERTa: <ref type="bibr" coords="9,364.28,443.32,16.43,10.91" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,383.43,443.32,12.55,10.91" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,398.71,443.32,12.55,10.91" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,413.98,443.32,12.55,10.91" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,429.25,443.32,12.55,10.91" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,444.52,443.32,12.32,10.91" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</p><p>One team used a majority voting ensemble with 3 BERT variants <ref type="bibr" coords="9,391.43,456.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>The typical approaches included the download of a pre-trained model, and it is further fine-tuning using the data provided. The most popular pre-trained model was Glove <ref type="bibr" coords="9,466.43,483.97,16.25,10.91" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>Fine-tuning details were not always fully provided when BERT or variants were used. The participating teams using BERT had to find solutions for the length of the input. Typically, BERT and its variants are used for shorter text. However, the length of articles in the newspaper dataset provided is much longer. Heuristics were mainly used for the selection of a part of the text. Several approaches used at the beginning of the article.</p><p>Also, other neural network models were used; in particular, recurrent neural networks were also popular. Team Kovachevich applied a LSTM based on GLOVE embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="9,450.61,578.81,16.41,10.91" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. LSTMs were used by team Spider and several other teams <ref type="bibr" coords="9,311.77,592.36,16.34,10.91" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,330.85,592.36,13.98,10.91" target="#b67">68]</ref> and Bi-LSTM only by one team <ref type="bibr" coords="9,487.49,592.36,16.14,10.91" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. One approach combined a LSTM and a Bi-LSTM <ref type="bibr" coords="9,307.24,605.91,16.25,10.91" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Often teams experimented also with traditional text processing methods as they are used for knowledge representation in information retrieval. TFIDF models were used. For example, Kovachevich used a Naïve Bayes classifier for TF-IDF features for the 500 most frequent stems in the dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="9,152.05,660.11,16.25,10.91" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>Lexical features in combination with bi-grams and POS as more complex language features were also used <ref type="bibr" coords="10,156.99,100.52,16.25,10.91" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Additional Approaches</head><p>Some teams used additional processing techniques which are not part of standard text classification algorithms. The Linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC) tool has been applied <ref type="bibr" coords="10,487.19,163.79,16.38,10.91" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. LIWC intends to extract features characterising the personality of a writer. Another lexical approach is taken by the Standford Empath Tool, which can be used for semantic analysis. It was also applied to create further features for the classification <ref type="bibr" coords="10,362.85,204.44,16.09,10.91" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The massive use of external resources led to good success for the team NoFake. An interesting data augmentation technique was suggested. It included inserting artificially created documents that were similar to the training documents <ref type="bibr" coords="10,179.09,245.09,16.25,10.91" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. However, it did not lead to very good results.</p><p>The idea of fake news being shared by less authoritative sites has been applied as well. One group implemented an authority model or proxy. They used the title as a Web search engine query and checked the authority of the sites which appeared in the hit list. The appearance of fact-checking sites was considered as a negative indicator for the misinformation status <ref type="bibr" coords="10,89.29,312.83,16.36,10.91" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Some of the authors mentioned including the temporal information for classification as described in <ref type="bibr" coords="10,147.39,326.38,16.55,10.91" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,166.90,326.38,12.42,10.91" target="#b69">70]</ref>. Also, it would be beneficial for an agent if we include the information about the fact-checked articles in HTML markup <ref type="bibr" coords="10,309.67,339.93,16.25,10.91" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Detailed Description of Participants Systems</head><p>In this subsection, we provide a detailed description of the individual participant papers to offer deeper insight into the individual approaches applied to the tasks. Team Black Ops [54] (3A:11) performed data pre-processing by removing stop-words and punctuation marks. Then, they experimented with decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers for Task 3A and found the latter to perform best. Team CIC <ref type="bibr" coords="10,143.00,458.33,19.88,9.77" target="#b52">[53]</ref> (3A:10 3B:5) experimented with logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machines, and random forest. Their experiments consisted of using stratified 5-fold cross-validation on the training data. Their best results were obtained using logistic regression for task 3A and a multi-layer perceptron for task 3B. Team CIC 3A:11 experimented with a decision tree, a random forest, and a gradient boosting algorithms. They found the latter to perform best. Team CIVIC-UPM [50] (3A:7 3B:8) participated in the two subtasks of task 3. They performed pre-processing, using a number of tools: (i) ftfy to repair Unicode and emoji errors, (ii) ekphrasis to perform lower-casing, normalizing percentages, time, dates, emails, phones, and numbers, (iii) contractions for abbreviation expansion, and (iv) NLTK for word tokenization, stop-words removal, punctuation removal and word lemmatization. Then, they combined doc2vec with transformer representations (Electra base, T5 small and T5 base, Longformer base, RoBERTa base and DistilRoBERTa base). They further used additional data from Kaggle's Ag News task, Kaggle's KDD2020, and Clickbait news detection competitions. Finally, they experimented with a number of classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization, Elastic Net, and SVMs. The best system for subtask 3A used DistilRoBERTa-base on the text body with oversampling and a sliding window for dealing with long texts. Their best system for task 3B used RoBERTa-base on the title+body text with oversampling but no sliding window. Team DLRG (3A:3 3B:4) experimented with a number of traditional approaches like Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression as well as an online passive-aggressive classifier and different ensembles thereof. The best result was achieved by an ensemble of Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and the Passive Aggressive classifier for task 3A. For task 3B, the Online Passive-Aggressive classifier outperformed all other approaches, including the considered ensembles.</p><p>Team GPLSI <ref type="bibr" coords="11,152.04,209.84,19.88,9.77" target="#b55">[56]</ref> (3A:16) applied the RoBERTa transformer together with different manuallyengineered features, such as the occurrence of dates and numbers or words from LIWC. Both the title and the body were concatenated as a single sequence of words. Rather than going for a single multiclass setting, they used two binary models considering the most frequent classes: false vs other and true vs other, followed by one three-class model. Team MUCIC <ref type="bibr" coords="11,159.14,277.58,19.88,9.77" target="#b57">[58]</ref> (3A:19 3B:12) used a majority voting ensemble with three BERT variants. They applied BERT, Distilbert, and RoBERTa, and fine-tuned the pre-trained models.</p><p>Team NITK_NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="11,168.90,304.68,24.62,9.77" target="#b47">[48]</ref> (3A:5 3B:1) proposed an approach, that included pre-processing and tokenization of the news article, and then experimented with multiple transformer models. The final prediction was made by an ensemble. Team NKovachevich [55] (3A:13 3B:3) created lexical features. They extracted the 500 most frequent word stems in the dataset and calculated the TF.IDF values, which they used in a multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier. A much better performance was achieved with an LSTM model that used GloVe embeddings. A little lower F1 value was achieved using BERT. They further found RoBERTa to perform worse than BERT. Team NLP&amp;IR@UNED [47] (3A:4) experimented with four transformer architectures and input sizes of 150 and 200 words. In the preliminary tests, the best performance was achieved by ALBERT with 200 words. They also experimented with combining TF.IDF values from the text, all the features provided by the LIWC tool, and the TF.IDF values from the first 20 domain names returned by a query to a search engine. Unlike what was obtained in the dev dataset, the best results were obtained in the official competition with the approach based on TF.IDF, LIWC, and domain names. Team NLytics (3A:12 3B:7) fined-tuned RoBERTa on the dataset for each of the sub-tasks. Since the data is unbalanced, they used under-sampling. They also truncated the documents to 512 words to fit into the RoBERTa input size. Team NoFake (3A:1 3B:2) applied BERT without fine-tuning, but used an extensive amount of additional data for training, downloaded from various fact-checking websites. Team Pathfinder [52] (3A:9 3A:10) participated in both tasks and used multinomial Naïve Bayes and random forest. The former performed better for both tasks. For task 3A, the they merged the classed false and partially false into one class, which boosted the model performance by 41% (a non-official score mentioned in the paper). Team Probity (3A:20) addressed the multiclass fake news detection subtask, they used a simple LSTM architecture where they adopted word2vec embeddings to represent the news articles. Team Qword <ref type="bibr" coords="11,155.03,656.96,19.88,9.77" target="#b59">[60]</ref> (3A:23) applied pre-processing techniques, which included stop-word removal, punctuation removal and lemmatization using a Porter stemmer. The TF.IDF values were calculated for the words. For these features, four classification algorithms were applied. The best result was given by Extreme Gradient Boosting. Team SAUD (3A:2) used an SVM with TF.IDF. They tried Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest and found SVM to work best. Team Sigmoid <ref type="bibr" coords="12,164.83,142.09,19.88,9.77" target="#b56">[57]</ref> (3A:17) experimented with different traditional machine learning approaches, with multinomial Naïve Bayes performing best, and one deep learning approach, namely an LSTM with the Adam optimizer. The latter outperformed the more traditional approaches. Team Spider (3A:22) applies an LSTM, after a pre-processing consisting of stop-word removal and stemming. Team UAICS <ref type="bibr" coords="12,154.15,223.39,19.88,9.77" target="#b48">[49]</ref> (3A:6) experimented with various models including BERT, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and feature-based models. Their submitted model is a Gradient Boosting with a weighted combination of three feature groups: bi-grams, POS tags, and lexical categories of words. Team University of Regensburg <ref type="bibr" coords="12,245.60,264.03,19.88,9.77" target="#b50">[51]</ref> (3A:8) used different fine-tuned variants of BERT with a linear layer on top and applied different approaches to address the maximum sequence length of BERT. Besides hierarchical transformer representations, they also experimented with different summarization techniques like extractive and abstractive summarization. They performed oversampling to address the class imbalance and extractive (using DistilBERT) and abstractive summarization (using distil-BART-CNN-12-6) before performing classification using fine-tuned BERT with a hierarchical transformer representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have presented a detailed overview of task 3, which focused on the classification of news articles with respect to the correctness of their main claims (task 3A) and their topical domain (task 3B). Most of the participants used transformer-based models like BERT and newer variants, RoBERTa being the most popular. For both subtask, the best run for each team outperformed the majority class baseline. Nonetheless, the F 1 -scores show large differences in the effectiveness of the applied approaches.</p><p>We plan a new iteration of task 3 in the CheckThat! lab augmenting the English data set and adding a multilingual setting.</p><p>Nevertheless, misinformation or Fake news will remain a social issue that cannot be purely solved by technological advancement.
