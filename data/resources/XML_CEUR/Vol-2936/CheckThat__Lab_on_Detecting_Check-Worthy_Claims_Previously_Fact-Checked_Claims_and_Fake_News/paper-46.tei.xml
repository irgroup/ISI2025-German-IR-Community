<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The proliferation of disinformation online, has given rise to a lot of research on automatic fake news detection. CLEF 2021 -CheckThat! Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="1,290.51,415.05,11.29,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,304.53,415.05,13.99,10.91" target="#b19">20]</ref> considers disinformation as a communication phenomenon. By detecting the use of various linguistic features in communication, it takes into account not only the content but also how a subject matter is communicated.</p><p>The shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,173.47,455.70,12.84,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> defines the following subtasks:</p><p>Subtask A Given the "textual content" of an article, specify a credibility level for the content ranging between "true" and "false" including "other".</p><p>Subtask B Given the "textual content" of an article, specify a tpical domain covered by the content.</p><p>In this work, we covered our approach on both multi-class classification tasks by detecting fake news in the former and assigning a topical domain in the latter task. To build our models, both subtasks only textual content is given as input. Below, we describe the systems built for these two subtasks. At the core of our systems is RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="2,356.37,86.97,11.53,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a pre-trained model based on the Transformer architecture <ref type="bibr" coords="2,221.27,100.52,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The goal of the shared task is to investigate automatic techniques for identifying various rhetorical and psychological features of disinformation campaigns. A comprehensive survey on fake news has been presented by Zhou and Zafarani <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.88,186.24,11.47,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Based on the structure of data reflecting different aspects of communication, they identified four different perspectives on fake news: (1) the false knowledge it carries, (2) its writing style, (3) its propagation patterns, and (4) the credibility of its creators and spreaders.</p><p>The shared task emphasizes communicative styles that systematically co-occur with persuasive intentions of (political) media actors. Similar to de Vreese et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,414.53,253.99,11.47,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, propaganda and persuasion is considered as an expression of political communication content and style. Hence, beyond the actual subject of communication, the way it is communicated is gaining importance.</p><p>We build our work on top of this foundation by first investigating content-based approaches for information discovery. Traditional information discovery methods are based on content: documents, terms, and the relationships between them <ref type="bibr" coords="2,335.14,321.73,11.41,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. They can be considered as general Information Extraction (IE) methods, automatically deriving structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. Communities of researchers contributed various techniques from machine learning, information retrieval, and computational linguistics to the different aspects of the information extraction problem. From a computer science perspective, existing approaches can be roughly divided into the following categories: rule-based, supervised, and semi-supervised. In our case, we followed the supervised approach by reframing the complex language understanding task as a simple classification problem. Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze human language texts and then assign a set of predefined tags or categories based on their content. Historically, the evolution of text classifiers can be divided into three stages: (1) simple lexicon-or keyword-based classifiers, (2) classifiers using distributed semantics, and (3) deep learning classifiers with advanced linguistic features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Deep Learning for Information Extraction</head><p>Recent work on text classification uses neural networks, particularly Deep Learning (DL). Badjatiya et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.41,561.15,12.84,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> demonstrated that these architectures, including variants of recurrent neural networks (RNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.46,574.70,11.49,10.91" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,180.91,574.70,12.59,10.91" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,196.46,574.70,12.42,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>, convolutional neural networks (CNN) Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.47,574.70,16.29,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or their combination (CharCNN, WordCNN, and HybridCNN), produce state-of-the-art results and outperform baseline methods (character n-grams, TF-IDF or bag-of-words representations).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Deep Learning architectures</head><p>Until recently, the dominant paradigm in approaching NLP tasks has been focused on the design of neural architectures, using only task-specific data and word embeddings such as those mentioned above. This led to the development of models, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), that achieve significantly better results in a range of NLP tasks than less complex classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression or Decision Tree Models. Badjatiya et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,408.92,127.61,12.84,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref> demonstrated that these approaches outperform models based on character and word n-gram representations. In the same paradigm of pre-trained models, methods like BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,368.02,154.71,17.98,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and XLNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,439.90,154.71,17.98,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Pre-trained Deep Language Representation Model</head><p>Indeed, the usage of a pre-trained word embedding layer to map the text into vector space which is then passed through a neural network, marked a significant step forward in text classification. The potential of pre-trained language models, as e.g. Word2Vec <ref type="bibr" coords="3,373.61,245.09,16.24,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="3,425.71,245.09,16.23,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, fastText <ref type="bibr" coords="3,486.89,245.09,16.23,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, or ELMo <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.91,258.64,18.07,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to capture the local patterns of features to benefit text classification, has been described by Castelle <ref type="bibr" coords="3,188.80,272.19,16.29,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Modern pre-trained language models use unsupervised learning techniques such as creating RNNs embeddings on large texts corpora to gain some primal "knowledge" of the language structures before a more specific supervised training steps in.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">About BERT and RoBERTa</head><p>BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is based on the Transformer model architectures introduced by Vaswani et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,357.31,362.56,11.39,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The general approach consists of two stages: first, BERT is pre-trained on vast amounts of text, with an unsupervised objective of masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. Second, this pre-trained network is then fine-tuned on task specific, labeled data. The Transformer architecture is composed of two parts, an Encoder and a Decoder, for each of the two stages. The Encoder used in BERT is an attention-based architecture for NLP. It works by performing a small, constant number of steps. In each step, it applies an attention mechanism to understand relationships between all words in a sentence, regardless of their respective position. By pre-training language representations, the Encoder yields models that can either be used to extract high quality language features from text data, or fine-tune these models on specific NLP tasks (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.). We rely on RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="3,301.39,498.05,11.41,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a pre-trained Encoder model which builds on BERT's language masking strategy. However, it modifies key hyperparameters in BERT such as removing BERT's next-sentence pre-training objective, and training with much larger minibatches and learning rates. Furthermore, RoBERTa was also trained on an order of magnitude more data than BERT, for a longer amount of time. This allows RoBERTa representations to generalize even better to downstream tasks compared to BERT. In this study, RoBERTa is at the core of each solution of the given subtasks.</p></div>

Thus, anything beyond this limitation will be truncated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Our approach</head><p>In this section, we provide a general overview of our approach to both subtasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>Model Architecture Subtasks A and B are both given as a multi-class classification problem. Our model for this subtask is based on RoBERTa. For the classification task, fine-tuning is performed using RobertaForSequenceClassification <ref type="bibr" coords="5,307.26,253.32,18.00,9.72" target="#b22">[23]</ref> -roberta-base -as the pre-trained model. RobertaForSequenceClassification optimizes for Binary Cross Entropy Loss using an AdamW optimizer with an initial learning rate set to 2e-5. Fine-tuning is done on NVIDIA TESLA P100 GPU using the Pytorch <ref type="bibr" coords="5,192.44,292.95,17.76,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> framework with a vocabulary size of 50265 and an input size of 512.</p><p>The model is trained to optimize the objective for 3 epochs. To estimate the performance of the resulting models we have chosen a ratio of 82/18 to split the data into training and validation set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input Embeddings</head><p>The input embedding layer converts the inputs into sequences of features: word-level sentence embeddings. These embedding features will be further processed by the latter encoding layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word-Level Sentence Embeddings</head><p>A sentence is split into words 𝑤 1 , ..., 𝑤 𝑛 with length of n by the WordPiece tokenizer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,232.38,431.10,16.09,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The word 𝑤 𝑖 and its index 𝑖 (𝑤 𝑖 's absolute position in the sentence) are projected to vectors by embedding sub-layers, and then added to the index-aware word embeddings:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,234.43,472.48,126.42,48.56">𝑤 ˆ𝑖 = 𝑊 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑(𝑤 𝑖 ) 𝑢 ˆ𝑖 = 𝐼𝑑𝑥𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑(𝑖) ℎ 𝑖 = 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁 𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑤 ˆ𝑖 + 𝑢 ˆ𝑖)</formula><p>Attention Layers Attention layers <ref type="bibr" coords="5,257.05,538.10,16.34,10.91" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,276.12,538.10,13.98,10.91" target="#b26">27]</ref> aim to retrieve information from a set of context vectors 𝑦 𝑗 related to a query vector 𝑥. An attention layer first calculates the matching score 𝑎 𝑗 between the query vector 𝑥 and each context vector 𝑦 𝑗 . Scores are then normalized by softmax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,239.65,588.32,115.97,33.16">𝑎 𝑗 = 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑥, 𝑦 𝑗 ) 𝛼 𝑗 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑎 𝑗 )/Σ 𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑎 𝑘 )</formula><p>The output of an attention layer is the weighted sum of the context vectors w.r.t. the softmax normalized score: 𝐴𝑡𝑡 𝑋→𝑌 (𝑥, {𝑦 𝑗 }) = Σ 𝑗 𝛼 𝑗 𝑦 𝑗 . An attention layer is called self-attention when the query vector 𝑥 is in the set of context vectors 𝑦 𝑗 . Specifically, we use the multi-head attention following Transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,236.49,669.58,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Target Encoding We encode the target labels using a multi-label binarizer as an analog of one-hot aka one-of-K scheme to multiple labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results and Discussion</head><p>We participated in both text classification subtasks. Official evaluation results on the test set are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,194.11,487.10,5.17,10.91">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="6,250.18,487.10,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">4</ref> for each subtask, respectively. We focused on suitable combinations of deep learning methods as well as their hyperparameter settings. Finetuning pre-trained language models like RoBERTa on downstream tasks has become ubiquitous in NLP research and applied NLP. Even without extensive pre-processing of the training data, we already achieve competitive results and can serve as strong baseline models which, when fine-tuned, significantly outperform training models from scratch. The submission for each subtask is based on the best performing model checkpoint on the validation set as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,115.79,581.95,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>When improving on the pretrained baseline models, class imabalance appears to be a primary challenge. This is clearly reflected in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,282.12,609.05,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, in particular, for the fake news detection subtask. The poor performance especially for the categories true and other, correlates with distribution of training data across these categories.</p><p>A commonly used tactic to deal with imbalanced datasets is to assign weights to each label.  Alternative solutions for coping with unbalanced datasets for supervised machine learning are undersampling or oversampling. Undersampling only considers a subset of an overpopulated class to end up with a balanced dataset. With the same goal oversampling creates copies of the unbalanced classes. Overfitting poses the most difficult challenge in this experiment, reducing its generalizability.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="7,306.83,104.82,193.26,198.38">K H D OW K F OL P D WH H F R Q R P \ F UL P H H OH F WL R Q V H G X F D WL R Q S UH G B V X P P D U\ DFWXDO K H D OW K F OL P D WH H F R Q R P \ F UL P H H OH F WL R Q V H G X F D WL R Q D F WX D OB V X P P D U\ SUHGLFWHG (b) topic domain identification</formula><p>With the above findings, we achieve state of the art performance on the text classification datasets. RoBERTa has proven to be powerful language representation model for various natural language processing tasks. As the results of this study show, RoBERTa is also an effective tool for multi-class text classification. In the future, we will probe more insight of BERT on how it works and how to counteract its tendency to overfitting.</p><p>To further improve our the trained baseline model, we suggest to use Longformer <ref type="bibr" coords="7,465.56,486.17,20.54,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref> as a base model. Trained from RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="7,239.63,499.72,15.26,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it addresses the problem of long sequences by replacing the attention matrices by sparse matrices, thus, allowing up to 4096 position embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future work</head><p>In future work, we plan to investigate more recent neural architectures for language representation such as T5 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,159.43,585.44,17.91,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,229.94,585.44,16.25,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we expect great opportunities for transfer learning from the areas such as argumentation mining <ref type="bibr" coords="7,190.87,612.54,17.78,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and offensive language detection <ref type="bibr" coords="7,358.10,612.54,16.11,10.91" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.
