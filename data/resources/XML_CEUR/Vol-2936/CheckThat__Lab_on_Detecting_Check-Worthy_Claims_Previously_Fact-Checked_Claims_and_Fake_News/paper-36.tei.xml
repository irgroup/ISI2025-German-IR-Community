<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Identifying check-worthy claims is often the first step of automated fact-checking systems. Tackling this task in a multilingual setting has been understudied. Encoding inputs with multilingual text representations could be one approach to solve the multilingual check-worthiness detection. However, this approach could suffer if cultural bias exists within the communities on determining what is check-worthy. In this paper, we propose a language identification task as an auxiliary task to mitigate unintended bias. With this purpose, we experiment joint training by using the datasets from CLEF-2021 CheckThat!, that contain tweets in English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Spanish and Turkish. Our results show that joint training of language identification and check-worthy claim detection tasks can provide performance gains for some of the selected languages.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The number of fact-checking initiatives worldwide has increased to fight misinformation. Manual fact-checking is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task that cannot cope up with the dissemination of misinformation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,257.12,450.52,11.56,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, the automation of fact-checking steps is required to speed up the process.</p><p>Check-worthy claim detection is a crucial step of an automated fact-checking pipeline <ref type="bibr" coords="1,473.88,477.61,11.23,10.91" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,487.40,477.61,7.42,10.91" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,497.11,477.61,8.88,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref> to prioritize what is needed to be fact-checked by fact-checkers or journalists. There has been an ongoing effort to address the claim-detection task by different research communities. Prior studies rely on machine learning methods that use statistical features with bag of words <ref type="bibr" coords="1,472.82,518.26,11.23,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,486.53,518.26,7.42,10.91" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,496.43,518.26,7.49,10.91" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Additionally, CLEF CheckThat! Lab (CTL) has organized shared tasks to tackle this problem in political debates <ref type="bibr" coords="1,176.61,545.36,11.44,10.91" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,190.76,545.36,9.00,10.91" target="#b7">8]</ref> and social media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,280.25,545.36,11.52,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This year, CTL 2021 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,391.06,545.36,18.00,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref> organized the shared task in English, Turkish, Bulgarian, Spanish and Arabic where the task datasets are collected from social media <ref type="bibr" coords="1,174.47,572.46,16.41,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The task's input is a tweet and the output is a score indicating the check-worthiness of the tweet.</p><p>Multilingual language models have been widely used in natural language understanding tasks with low-resourced languages (e.g. comment moderation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,370.11,613.11,16.22,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, fake news detection <ref type="bibr" coords="1,484.16,613.11,15.67,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p><p>However, the exhibition of cultural differences is inevitable in tasks in which cultural context is required <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.83,100.52,16.09,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This issue could harm the transfer of knowledge across languages. Fact-checking is one of such tasks where disagreements could exist on credibility assessments even among the domain experts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.83,127.61,16.52,10.91" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,198.08,127.61,12.39,10.91" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Furthermore, exposure of global claims and their credibility (e.g. Covid-19) could vary by country <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.14,141.16,16.25,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>With this motivation, in this paper, we present a unified framework that processes the input in different languages and uses a multilingual sentence transformer trained on the mixed language training set to learn representations for the low-resourced languages. To mitigate the bias in the sentence representations, we introduce a language identification task and train the model jointly for check-worthiness detection (CWD) and language identification (LI) tasks.</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. We introduce a framework whose aim is to be aware of cultural bias. We conduct an extensive analysis on its performance. 2. We employ joint learning to reduce unintended bias. To the best of our knowledge, a similar method has not been applied to reduce bias in multilingual fact-checking tasks. 3. Our framework could be extended with various multilingual transformer models in Huggingface <ref type="bibr" coords="2,176.19,316.23,16.25,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The source code and the trained models are publicly available<ref type="foot" coords="2,477.11,314.47,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>ClaimBuster is the first study to address the check-worthy claim detection task. The component of ClaimBuster <ref type="bibr" coords="2,156.98,388.40,11.23,10.91" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.59,388.40,8.88,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref> that detects check-worthy claims is trained with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using tf-idf bag of words, named entity types, POS tags, sentiment, and sentence length as a feature set. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.49,415.50,12.76,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref> proposed a fully connected neural network model trained on claims and their related political debate content. Last year, CTL 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.58,429.05,12.69,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> organized a shared CWD task in English and Arabic for the claims in social media. In this shared task, multilingual transformer models performed well on the Arabic dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,302.45,456.15,16.41,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, for the English datasets, the participants did not utilize the multilingual transformer model. In our approach, we fine-tune the multilingual sentence transformers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,271.88,483.25,16.41,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which is computationally less expensive than the BERT models, on the mixed language of the training dataset. We trained one model and employed this for all languages. The multi-task learning approach has been a proven method to mitigate unintended bias. Das et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,132.95,537.44,17.81,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> applied multi-task learning on a face recognition task using Convolution Neural Network. As a related example in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, Vaidya et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,564.54,17.76,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref> mitigate the identity bias in toxic comment detection. Their model encodes the inputs with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM). However, our approach and the tasks we deal with are different from those studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we introduce our framework, which is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,420.97,111.28,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The input of the framework is a Twitter post. The input is tokenized with a sentence transformer encoder in order to be fed into the transformer layer. After obtaining the shared text representation from a sentence transformer, the framework fine-tunes the shared representation and the classification layers for CWD and LI tasks by minimizing a joint loss. In the following subsections, we give more details about the sentence transformer and the joint training. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Sentence Transformer</head><p>The framework uses a Sentence-BERT (SBERT) transformer <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.19,400.19,16.09,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which is a modified BERT that uses a siamese and a triplet network. The SBERT can provide semantically more meaningful sentence embeddings than the BERT models. To support multilingualism in our framework and to enable fine-tuning with a small GPU, we use a pre-trained SBERT that was obtained by applying knowledge distillation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.09,454.39,17.99,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and that was trained on a multilingual corpus from a community-driven Q&amp;A website <ref type="foot" coords="3,235.00,466.18,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . We refer to it as QDMSBERT.</p><p>We apply mean pooling on the output of QDMSBERT to obtain sentence embeddings. We set the maximum length of the tokens as 128 by padding shorter texts and truncating longer texts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Joint Learning</head><p>The framework contains two task layers: one is for the CWD task and the other is for the LI task. The input of the task layers are shared QDMSBERT embeddings. Both task layers use the same neural network structure, consisting of two fully-connected layers followed by a softmax layer that outputs the probabilities of task classes. During the training, the weighted loss of the CWD and the LI task are summed up to compute the joint loss as seen in Equation <ref type="formula" coords="3,460.57,598.57,5.09,10.91">1</ref>where 𝛼 is a probability indicating the importance of the tasks. Lastly, the joined loss is minimized by optimizing the weights of the transformer network and the tasks' classification layers. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,227.19,652.77,278.79,11.42">𝐽 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 𝛼𝐽 𝐶𝑊 𝐷 + (1 -𝛼)𝐽 𝐿𝐼 (1)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we give the details of the CLEF 2021 CheckThat! dataset, explain the baselines and the systems that we compared, and present the experimental settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset</head><p>The CLEF 2021 CheckThat! offers datasets in English, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, and Bulgarian for the CWD task. The statistics of the datasets are given in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,395.42,394.25,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The class distribution of the datasets for each language is highly imbalanced, which reflects the real-world cases. Check-worthy samples (Pos-Class) are the minority. English and Bulgarian datasets contain only COVID topic. The Turkish dataset covers miscellaneous topics, and the Spanish dataset has only samples about politics. The topics of the Arabic dataset are mainly COVID related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Baselines</head><p>We compare the proposed model (QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) against the following models and systems:</p><p>• SVM: It encodes the texts with unigrams.</p><p>• Monolingual Models and Mk-Bg-BERT: We use a distilled SBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,435.86,538.58,18.07,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> model <ref type="foot" coords="4,485.37,536.83,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> for the English samples. We couldn't find any monolingual SBERTs for Arabic, Turkish and Spanish; therefore, we use popular BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,302.90,565.68,17.98,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> variants that are trained on monolingual corpora. TrBERT<ref type="foot" coords="4,196.15,577.47,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> is the model for Turkish samples, BETO <ref type="bibr" coords="4,385.34,579.23,18.02,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for Spanish, and lastly AraBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="4,160.49,592.78,17.82,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for the tweets in Arabic. For Bulgarian tweets, we leverage a BERT model (Mk-Bg-BERT) trained on Macedonian and Bulgarian corpora <ref type="foot" coords="4,393.37,604.57,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">5</ref> .</p><p>• CLEF-2021: Submissions for the CLEF-2021 CWD task <ref type="bibr" coords="5,367.28,86.97,18.00,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that support all languages, namely Accenture, BigIR and TOBB ETU<ref type="foot" coords="5,299.08,98.76,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . • QDMSBERT: QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 where the weights are only optimized for the CWD task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Experimental Settings and Environment</head><p>We split the training dataset randomly into five chunks and thus train five different QDMSBERT models with the epochs of 3, weighted decay Adam optimizer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,369.90,178.70,16.36,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and in batches of 16. The mean of each model's predictions represents the final score. We use the GPU of Google Colab <ref type="foot" coords="5,501.96,190.49,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">7</ref>for training the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,116.09,277.97,5.13,10.91">2</ref> presents the results of each model. We report the test results in official metrics of the shared task: Mean Average Precision (MAP), precision scores at 1-50 (P@1-P@50), R-Precision (R-Prec), and R-Rank. We first compare QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 with the SVM and QDMSBERT. QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 outperforms QDMSBERT in many metrics across the languages except for Arabic, also QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 underperforms the SVM in Spanish. We see performance gains on the English, Bulgarian and Turkish samples. The results indicate that QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 presents better results on the examples in COVID-19, but is generalized less to other topics in Spanish and in Arabic.</p><p>Among the results by the teams who submitted runs in all languages (group CLEF-2021), the performance of QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 is the best in English and the second in Bulgarian which is promising for a low-resource language.</p><p>Monolingual BERT models outperformed our model and the other teams' submissions in English and Spanish. TrBERT and AraBERT also show better results than our approach. Although we improve our outcome compared to QDMSBERT by mitigating differences across the languages, the performance of the monolingual embeddings is still unsurpassed in this task.</p><p>The presented results of QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 were accomplished by using a contribution of task loss (𝛼) of 0.6. This initial value was choose heuristically. As an ablation study, we change the 𝛼 values of the tasks' loss and train QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 for each 𝛼 value to understand its influence on the CWD learning. The optimal alpha value is 0.8. In Bulgarian samples, the lower alpha values could also yield good performance for the CWD task.</p><p>Lastly, we analyze the feature representations of QDMSBERT and QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 . We visualize the feature representations by applying t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding nonlinear dimensionality reduction (T-SNE) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,293.17,576.05,16.42,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,419.63,576.05,3.81,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the features that QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 produces are more clearly separated. For instance, the cluster with English samples (lower right region of Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,233.88,603.15,8.70,10.91" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) in the T-SNE for QDMSBERT overlaps with both the cluster of Turkish and the cluster of Bulgarian samples. In contrast, the T-SNE for QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡</p></div>

To mitigate bias due to cultural differences, we leveraged multilingual sentence BERTs as feature representations and trained them jointly with the language identification task. Our approach outperformed the SVM and QDMSBERT for almost all of the languages on the CLEF2021 dataset. Also, it became one of the top-performing approaches in Bulgarian and English datasets among the submissions that have been done for all these languages. In the future, we will investigate how the consideration of images <ref type="bibr" coords="8,237.13,602.51,17.91,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that are embedded in the tweets influence the results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,335.06,354.23,9.43;3,89.29,200.91,416.69,121.84"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Our proposed framework (QDMSBERT 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) for mitigating unintended bias.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,89.29,200.91,416.69,121.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
