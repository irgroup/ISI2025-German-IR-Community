<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Social media platforms provide a suitable environment to easily communicate with other people. Therefore, many people enjoy the freedom of speech on these platforms by sharing any message they want. However, the very same platforms can be also used to spread misinformation, which has a huge negative impact on society such as massive stock price changes 1 , vaccine hesitancy 2 , and using dangerous chemicals for medical treatment 3 .</p><p>Many journalists combat against spread of misinformation by investigating veracity of claims and sharing their ndings with the public via fact-checking websites such as Snopes 4 and PolitiFact 5 . While these fact-checking websites are vital in the combat against misinformation, the problem continues to exist because false news spread faster than true news <ref type="bibr" coords="1,449.60,478.06,11.58,9.63" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and factchecking is an extremely time-consuming process <ref type="bibr" coords="1,318.92,491.61,11.58,9.63" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, we urgently need systems assisting fact-checkers in the combat against misinformation.</p><p>Building systems that automatically detect veracity of claims is the ultimate goal for factchecking studies. However, building a "perfect" fact checking system will not prevent spread of misinformation and its negative outcomes, if people continue to share everything they see on Internet. Therefore, we believe that we also need systems that warn social media users when they share a check-worthy claim to allow them to re-think sharing it. In addition, these systems can help human fact-checkers to detect claims to be fact-checked, allowing them to spend their precious eorts for the most important claims. Therefore, many researchers focused on how to detect check-worthy claims <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.71,128.67,11.48,9.63" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.13,128.67,7.65,9.63" target="#b3">4]</ref>.

Lab <ref type="bibr" coords="2,277.25,169.32,11.56,9.63" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The task covers tweet datasets in ve dierent languages including Arabic (AR), Bulgarian (BG), English (EN), Spanish (SP), and Turkish (TR). We investigate several methods to eectively ne-tune transformer models for each language. In particular, we explore ve dierent methods: 1) ne-tuning a language-specic transformer model for each language, 2) balancing label distribution by undersampling the majority label, 3) data augmentation using machine translation, 4) weak supervision, and 5) cross-lingual training.</p><p>In our experiments on the development set, we observe that ne-tuning a language-specic model with cleaned tweets yield the best results for all languages. Therefore, we pick it as our primary model and submit its output for the ocial ranking. We are ranked rst in Turkish and Spanish datasets. However, our rank for Arabic, Bulgarian, and English is 6 𝑡ℎ , 4 𝑡ℎ , and 10 𝑡ℎ , respectively. Our experiments on the test data also show that our undersampling method for Arabic yields higher results than our primary model. In addition, using original tweets instead of cleaned ones yields much higher performance than our submitted results for Bulgarian and English datasets.</p><p>The organization of the paper is as follows. We discuss related work in Section 2. Section 3 explains our methods. We present experimental results in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed Methods</head><p>In our work, we investigated how to train transformer models eectively. The methods we use include language-specic training (Section 3.1), balancing label distribution (Section 3.2), data augmentation using machine translation (Section 3.2), weak supervision (Section 3.4), and cross-lingual training (Section 3.5). Now we explain our methods in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Language-Specific Training</head><p>Prior work showed that ne-tuning transformer models pre-trained for a single language yields great performance in various NLP tasks, outperforming several state-of-the-art models <ref type="bibr" coords="3,104.87,480.91,16.42,9.63" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Therefore, in this method, we use a language-specic transformer model for each language. In particular, we use BERTurk <ref type="foot" coords="3,271.87,492.42,3.71,7.04" target="#foot_0">6</ref> , AraBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,326.81,494.46,16.40,9.63" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, BETO <ref type="foot" coords="3,377.16,492.42,3.71,7.04" target="#foot_1">7</ref> , and BERT base model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,487.92,494.46,18.06,9.63" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for Turkish, Arabic, Spanish, and English, respectively. For Bulgarian, we use a pre-trained RoBERTa model <ref type="foot" coords="3,162.02,519.52,3.71,7.04" target="#foot_2">8</ref> . We ne-tune each model with the respective training data. In this method, we explore two dierent approaches: 1) language-specic models ne-tuned using the original tweets (𝐿𝑆𝑀 𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙_𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠 ), and 2) language-specic models ne-tuned using cleaned tweets (𝐿𝑆𝑀 𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑑_𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠 ) in which we remove all mentions and URLs from tweets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Balancing Label Distribution</head><p>In a random sample of tweets, it is less likely to encounter check-worthy claims, yielding imbalanced data distribution. We also observe this situation in the datasets shared for Task 1A (See Table <ref type="table" coords="4,135.76,88.02,3.50,9.63" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The ratio of check-worthy tweets in the train set is 22%, 13%, 35%, 8%, and 38% for Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Spanish, and Turkish, respectively.</p><p>Imbalanced label distribution can negatively aect the learning process for models. In order to make the dataset fully balanced, we can oversample check-worthy claims or undersample not-check-worthy claims. Yasser et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,270.10,142.22,17.91,9.63" target="#b17">[18]</ref> report that oversampling do not improve their model's performance on check-worthy claim detection. Therefore, we investigate undersampling approach by setting the check-worthy claim ratio same for all languages, to make a fair comparison across languages. However, having a fully balanced dataset (i.e., the same amount of tweets for each label) would cause removing many tweets. Therefore, we make the check-worthy claim ratio 30% of the train set by undersampling. In particular, we undersample not-check-worthy claims in Arabic, Bulgarian, and Spanish datasets. Check-worthy claim ratio for Turkish and English datasets is higher than 30%. Therefore, we undersample check-worthy claims in these datasets. While undersampling the positive class might not be eective, we do it to make a fair comparison across languages. Subsequently, we remove mentions and URLs and ne-tune language-specic models for each language, as mentioned before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Data Augmentation Using Machine Translation</head><p>The amount of labeled data has a signicant impact on the trained models. However, labeling is a costly and time consuming process. Therefore, in order to increase labeled data size automatically, we exploit machine translation methods. In particular, for each language, we translate tweets labeled as check-worthy in the other languages using Google Translate. Affier translation, we remove mentions and URLs and ne-tune language-specic models for each language. This method also reduces the imbalanced label distribution problem. For instance, the ratio of check-worthy claims for Spanish dataset increases to 50.8% by this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Weak Supervision</head><p>Another way to increase the labeled data size is weak supervision <ref type="bibr" coords="4,385.65,458.46,16.29,9.63" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, we use the following weak-supervision method. We rst rank words based on their frequency in each dataset, and manually select 10 words, which are related to the topic of the respective datasets, among the most frequent 100 words. Table <ref type="table" coords="4,281.01,499.21,5.61,9.51" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows these keywords. Then we crawl 500 tweets tracking each of these words separately using Twint<ref type="foot" coords="4,329.28,510.62,3.71,7.04" target="#foot_3">9</ref> tool, yielding 5000 tweets in total for each language. Subsequently, we label these collected tweets using XLM-R <ref type="bibr" coords="4,427.01,526.21,17.99,9.63" target="#b32">[33]</ref> model which is ne-tuned using cleaned tweets of the respective train data. Finally, we remove URLs and hashtags from the tweets and ne-tune our language-specic transformer models for each language using the training data and tweets labeled by our XLM-R model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Cross Lingual Training</head><p>Multilingual transformer models enable training models with labeled data in a particular language and use the trained model for another language. Therefore, they have great potential for further advancements in NLP, especially for low-resource languages. In this method, we explore whether cross-lingual training is eective to detect check-worthy claims. In particular, for each language pair, we combine their train set and ne-tune mBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="5,413.52,326.31,17.95,9.63" target="#b29">[30]</ref> model using the combined dataset. Subsequently, the ned-tuned model can be used for all ve languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we rst explain our experimental setup (Section 4.1). Then we present our results on the development and test sets. (Section 4.2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental Setup</head><p>Dataset. The datasets shared by the shared-task organizers are divided into train, development, and test sets for each language. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,261.50,475.41,5.61,9.51" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows data and label distribution for each dataset. In our experiments with the development set, we use the train sets of languages (and additional data we get with our methods explained in Section 3) to ne-tune models. In our experiments with the test set, we also add the development set of each language to their train data to ne-tune models. Implementation. We use ktrain<ref type="foot" coords="6,237.31,222.71,7.41,7.04" target="#foot_4">10</ref> library to ne-tune our models. In order to set parameters of each model, we conducted (not reported) experiments on the development set with various congurations and picked the best performing one for each model. In particular, the parameters of each model we use are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,277.65,265.50,4.00,9.51">3</ref>. We set learning rate to 5e-5 for all models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Results on the Development Set</head><p>We rst evaluate the performance of each model we propose in the development set in order to pick the model to be submitted as our primary model. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,364.98,349.34,5.61,9.51" target="#tab_2">4</ref> shows average precision (AP) scores of our cross-lingual approach for each language pair. For each language, we achieve the best result when one of the languages in the train set is same with the language of the development set. Interestingly, even though Turkish is linguistically the most distant language to others, using Turkish as one of the languages in the train set yields the best results for Bulgarian, English, Spain, and Turkish. This might be because the ratio of check-worthy tweets in the train set of Turkish dataset is higher than all other languages. In addition, using English as one of the languages in the train set yields the best performance for three languages (i.e., Turkish, Arabic, and English). This might be because of mBERT's capability to represent English texts better than other languages.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,130.40,115.22,5.61,9.51" target="#tab_3">5</ref> shows results of our other methods on the development test. 𝐿𝑆𝑀 𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑑_𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠 yields the best performance for all languages. Therefore, we use it as our primary model for our participation in the shared-task. In addition, we observe that data augmentation with translation yields the lowest score in most of the cases, suggesting that check-worthiness of claims vary across nations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Results on Test Test</head><p>We submit our results for 𝐿𝑆𝑀 𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑑_𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠 model. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,349.36,361.29,5.61,9.51" target="#tab_4">6</ref> presents AP score and rank of our submitted results. We are ranked rst for Turkish and Spanish languages based on AP score. However, our models do not achieve a high ranking for the other languages. In order to further investigate the performance of our models, we report performance of each model on the test set in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,248.39,543.84,4.00,9.51" target="#tab_5">7</ref>. For the cross-lingual training approach, we use the best performing model in the development set for each language. In particular, we report results for mBERT model trained with TR+BG tweets for Bulgarian, TR+EN tweets for English and Turkish, TR+AR tweets for Arabic, and TR+SP tweets for Spanish.</p><p>Comparing our results for the development and test sets, we observe that performance of models change dramatically across datasets. In the development set, ne-tuning language specic models with cleaned data yields the best scores in all datasets. However, in the test set, it yields the best results for only Turkish and Spanish. For Arabic, undersampling yields 0.622 AP score, outperforming the participant ranked 2 𝑛𝑑 in the ocial results of the sharedtask. In addition, we observe that removing mentions and URLs has negative impact on the language-specic models for Bulgarian and English. 𝐿𝑆𝑀 𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙_𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑠 yields 0.171 AP score in the English dataset, outperforming the participant ranked 3 𝑟𝑑 in the ocial results of the shared-task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present our participation in Task 1A of CLEF 2021 CheckThat! lab. We explore several methods to ne-tune transformer models eectively by changing the train set. In particular, we investigate ve dierent methods including language-specic training, undersampling, data augmentation with machine translation, weak supervision, and crosslingual training. Our experiments on the development set show that ne-tuning a language specic transformer model with cleaned tweets yields the highest performance. Therefore, we submit our results using this model. We are ranked rst for Turkish and Spanish datasets in the ocial ranking. However, the models we submitted for other languages did not achieve the same performance. Our experiments also show that data augmentation with machine translation and weak supervision generally do not yield high performance.</p><p>In the future, we plan to investigate how our methods' performance can be increased by better parameter tuning and more sophisticated weak-supervision and data augmentation methods. In addition, we think that developing subject-specic check-worthy claim detection models might be an eective solution for this problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,88.99,90.49,356.46,193.67"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Selected Words to Collect Additional Tweets</figDesc><table coords="5,153.50,116.30,291.95,167.86"><row><cell>Arabic</cell><cell>Bulgarian</cell><cell>English</cell><cell>Spanish</cell><cell>Turkish</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>българия</cell><cell>covid19</cell><cell>espa ña</cell><cell>yüzde</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>случаи</cell><cell>virus</cell><cell>gobierno</cell><cell>milyar</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>заразени</cell><cell>people</cell><cell>millones</cell><cell>türkiye</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>кризата</cell><cell>cases</cell><cell>sánchez</cell><cell>dolar</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>пандемията</cell><cell>health</cell><cell>personas</cell><cell>istanbul</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>ваксина</cell><cell>testing</cell><cell>euros</cell><cell>belediye</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>разпространението</cell><cell>confirmed</cell><cell>gobierno</cell><cell>ticaret</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>мерките</cell><cell>coronavirus</cell><cell>madrid</cell><cell>seçim</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>европа</cell><cell>hospital</cell><cell>política</cell><cell>ülkeler</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>денонощие</cell><cell>patients</cell><cell>contra</cell><cell>enflasyon</cell></row></table></figure>
