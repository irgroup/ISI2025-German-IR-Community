<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We describe the fourth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2021 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting three tasks related to factuality, and it covers Arabic, Bulgarian, English, Spanish, and Turkish. Here, we present the task 2, which asks to detect previously fact-checked claims (in two languages). A total of four teams participated in this task, submitted a total of sixteen runs, and most submissions managed to achieve sizable improvements over the baselines using transformer based models such as BERT, RoBERTa. In this paper, we describe the process of data collection and the task setup, including the evaluation measures used, and we give a brief overview of the participating systems. Last but not least, we release to the research community all datasets from the lab as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research in detecting previously fact-checked claims.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There has been a growing concern about the spread of dis/mis-information in social media, ad this has become an urgent social and political issue. Over time, several initiatives for manual fact-checking have been launched, with over 200 fact-checking organizations actively working worldwide. 1 Unfortunately, these efforts do not scale and they are clearly insufficient, given the scale of disinformation propagating in different communication channels, which, according to the World Health Organization, has grown into the First Global Infodemic in the times of COVID-19.</p><p>There has been a surge in research to develop systems for automatic fact-checking. However, such systems suffer from credibility issues. Hence, it is important to reduce the manual effort by detecting when a claim has already been fact-checked. Work in this direction includes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,493.06,114.06,12.93,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="2,108.57,127.61,11.62,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: the former developed a dataset for the task and proposed a ranking model, while the latter proposed a neural ranking model using textual and visual modalities.</p><p>To deal with this problem, we launched the CheckThat! Lab, which features a number of tasks aiming to help automate the fact-checking process and to reduce the spread of disinformation and misinformation. The CheckThat! lab<ref type="foot" coords="2,284.74,180.06,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">2</ref> was run for the fourth time in the framework of CLEF 2021. The purpose of the 2021 edition of the lab was to foster the development of technology that would enable finding check-worthy claims, finding claims that have been previously fact-checked, and predicting the veracity of a news article and its topic. Thus, the lab focuses on three types of content: (i) tweets, (ii) political debates and speeches, and (iii) news articles.</p><p>In this paper, we describe in detail the second task, detecting previously fact-checked claims, of the CheckThat! lab tasks. <ref type="foot" coords="2,206.91,274.90,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,244.58,276.66,4.97,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the full CheckThat! identification and verification pipeline, including the tasks on detecting check-worthy claims, detecting previously factchecked claims, and veracity and topic detection of news articles. The second task is defined as follows: "given a check-worthy input claim and a set of verified claims, rank the previously verified claims in order of usefulness to fact-check the input claim. " It consists of the following two subtasks: Subtask 2A: Detecting previously fact-checked claims in tweets. Given a tweet, detect whether the claim it makes was previously fact-checked with respect to a collection of fact-checked claims. This is a ranking task, offered in Arabic and English, where the systems need to return a list of top-𝑛 candidates.</p></div>

This is a ranking task, and it was offered in English.</p><p>For Subtask 2A, we focused on tweets, and it was offered in Arabic, and English. The participants were free to work on any language(s) of their interest, and they could also use multilingual approaches that make use of all datasets for training. Subtask 2A attracted four teams, and the most successful approaches used transformers or a combination of embeddings, manually engineered features, and neural networks. Section 3 offers more details.</p><p>For Subtask 2B, we focused on political debates and speeches, and we used PolitiFact as the main data source. The task attracted three teams, and a combination of transformers, prepossessing, and augmentation approaches performed the best. Section 4 gives more details.</p><p>As for the rest of the paper, Section 2 discusses some related work, and Section 5 concludes with final remarks. </p></div>

However, there are credibility issues with automated systems <ref type="bibr" coords="3,323.36,406.78,16.38,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and thus a reasonable solution is to build tools to facilitate human fact-checkers, e.g., by detecting previously fact-checked claims. This is an underexplored task and the only directly relevant work is <ref type="bibr" coords="3,396.42,433.88,11.24,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,410.14,433.88,12.36,10.91" target="#b19">20]</ref>; here, we use their annotation setup and one of their datasets: PolitiFact. Previous work has mentioned the task as an integral step of an end-to-end automated fact-checking pipeline, but there was very little detail provided about this component and it was not evaluated <ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.42,474.52,16.25,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In an industrial setting, Google has developed the Fact Check Explorer, <ref type="foot" coords="3,405.36,486.32,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> which allows users to search a number of fact-checking websites. However, the tool cannot handle a complex claim, as it uses the standard Google search funcionality, which is not optimized for semantic matching of long claims.</p><p>Another related work is the ClaimsKG dataset and system <ref type="bibr" coords="3,363.39,542.27,16.36,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which includes 28K claims from multiple sources, organized into a knowledge graph (KG). The system can perform data exploration, e.g., it can find all claims that contain a certain named entity or keyphrase. In contrast, we are interested in detecting whether a claim was previously fact-checked.</p><p>Finally, the task is related to semantic relatedness tasks, e.g., from the GLUE benchmark <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,610.02,16.27,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, such as natural language inference (NLI) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,295.96,610.02,16.27,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, recognizing textual entailment (RTE) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,486.84,610.02,16.27,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, paraphrase detection <ref type="bibr" coords="3,183.29,623.56,16.09,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and semantic textual similarity (STS-B) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,378.84,623.56,16.09,10.91" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, it differs from them in a number of aspects; see <ref type="bibr" coords="3,237.63,637.11,12.84,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for more detail and discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Subtask 2A: Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims in Tweets</head><p>Given a tweet, the task asks to detect whether the claim the tweet makes was previously factchecked with respect to a collection of fact-checked claims. The task is offered in Arabic and English. This is a ranking task, where the systems are asked to return a list of top-𝑛 candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dataset</head><p>Arabic To construct our verified claims collection, we selected 5,921 Arabic claims from AraFacts <ref type="bibr" coords="4,131.57,219.43,16.39,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and 24,408 English claims from ClaimsKG <ref type="bibr" coords="4,346.34,219.43,16.39,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which we translated to Arabic using the Google translate API. <ref type="foot" coords="4,228.25,231.23,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">5</ref> To obtain our tweet-VerClaim pairs, we first selected a set of 1,274 Arabic verified claims from AraFacts such that each claim has at least one stated tweet example in its corresponding fact-checking article. Second, we selected one tweet example for each verified claim following the guidelines below:</p><p>1. Select an Arabic tweet.</p><p>2. Avoid tweets where the claim is stated in an image or a video.</p><p>3. Try to choose the tweet example that does not exactly match the text of the claim.</p><p>4. Avoid tweets that are relevant, but do not contain the claim or it is not clear whether they are about the claim.</p><p>5. Avoid tweets that have more than one claim.</p><p>The two annotators who constructed the tweet-VerClaim pairs swapped their pairs to doublecheck that the selected tweets were compliant with the guidelines. They further resolved any disagreements by discussing the reasons behind their choice, and excluded the claims where the disagreement remains. We ended up with 858 tweet-VerClaim pairs.</p><p>Due to the fact that AraFacts contains verified claims from five different Arabic fact-checking platforms, and since a claim can be verified by multiple sources, we had to check whether the annotated tweets can be paired with more than one claim from our verified claims collection. We first adopted Jaccard similarity to check whether each verified claim in our collection was verified by multiple sources. For each given verified claim, we selected all the claims that had a Jaccard similarity above 30%; then, we asked the annotators to double-check and to exclude any non-similar claims. Given similar claims to the ones in our qrels (query relevances), we constructed new tweet-VerClaim pairs.</p><p>To further verify any missing similar claims, we used Pyserini <ref type="bibr" coords="4,390.25,581.95,18.07,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref> to index our verified claims collection and we retrieved the top-25 potentially relevant verified claims for each tweet in our dataset. One annotator then checked for missing tweet-VerClaim pairs in our previously constructed qrels, and we expanded the qrels accordingly. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,380.76,622.60,5.08,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents some input tweet examples from our dataset and the corresponding top-5 verified claims ranked based on their relevance using a BM25 system.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>English To construct the verified claims database, we used Snopes, a fact-checking website that targets rumors spreading in social media, and we collected 13,835 verified claims. Their fact-checking journalists often cite the tweet or the social media post that spreads the rumor when writing an article about a claim. We looked over all crawled verified articles, and we collected 1,401 tweets. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,127.22,455.85,5.11,10.91" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows examples of the input tweets and the results retrieved by the BM25 baseline. From example 1 of the table, we can see that the tweet-vclaim pairs are more complex than simple textual similarity. Then, example 2 shows that, in order to do a good decision about a pair, we need to understand the contextual meaning of the sentences.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,126.35,510.05,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows statistics about the CT-VCR-21 corpus for Task 2, including both subtasks and languages. CT-VCR-21 stands for CheckThat! verified claim retrieval 2021. Input-VerClaim pairs represent input claims with their corresponding verified claims by a fact-checking source. For Arabic, we randomly split the data into 512 training, 85 development, and 261 test examples. In total, the Arabic dataset consists of 858 queries, 1,039 qrels, and a collection of 30,329 verified claims. For English, we split the data into 70%, 15% and 15% for training, development, and test, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Evaluation</head><p>For the ranking tasks, as in the two previous editions of the CheckThat! lab, we calculated Mean Average Precision (MAP), reciprocal rank, Precision@𝑘 (𝑃 @𝑘) and MAP@𝑘 for 𝑘 P t1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30u. We used MAP@5 as the official evaluation measure. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Overview of the Systems</head><p>A total of four teams participated in this task, submitting sixteen runs. One team participated in the Arabic task and three teams participated in the English task. Below, we discuss briefly the approach of each team.</p><p>Team bigIR (2A:ar:1) fine-tuned AraBERT <ref type="bibr" coords="6,280.75,641.25,17.79,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref> by adding two neural network layers on top of it to predict the relevance score for a given tweet-VerClaim pair. The fine-tuned model was used to re-rank the candidate claims based on the predicted relevance scores. Team Aschern <ref type="bibr" coords="7,162.07,294.60,19.88,9.76" target="#b31">[32]</ref> (2A:en:1) used TF.IDF, fine-tuned pre-trained sentence-level BERT, and the re-ranking LambdaMART model.

Arabic A single system was submitted for this task by the bigIR team. They used AraBERT to re-rank a list of candidates retrieved by a BM25 model. They first constructed a balanced training dataset where the positive examples correspond to the query relevance (qrels) provided by the organizers, while the negative examples were selected from the top retrieved candidates by BM25 such that they are not already labeled as positive. Second, they fine-tuned AraBERT to predict the relevance score for a given tweet-VerClaim pair. They added two neural network layers on top of AraBERT to perform the classification.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have provided a detailed overview of the CLEF 2021 CheckThat! lab task 2, which focused on detecting previously fact-checked claims in tweets (Subtask 2A), and in political debates or speeches (Subtask 2B). Inline with the general mission of CLEF, we promoted multi-linguality by offering the task in two different languages: Arabic and English. The participating systems fine-tuned transformer models (such as BERT and RoBERTa) and some tried data augmentation. For Subtask 2A, four systems (one for Arabic and three for English) participated, and all outperformed a BM25 baseline. For Subtask 2B, none of the three participating teams could beat the baseline.</p><p>We plan a new iteration of the CLEF CheckThat! lab and of task 2, which will offer new larger training datasets and additional languages.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,89.29,293.85,416.94,8.93;3,89.29,305.86,418.23,8.87;3,89.02,317.81,282.85,8.87"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1:The full verification pipeline of the CheckThat! lab 2021.
