<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the current world, individuals are faced with decision making problems and opinion formation processes on a daily basis. For example, debating or choosing between two similar products. However, answering a comparative question by retrieving documents based only on traditional measures (such as TF-IDF and BM25) does not always satisfy the need. Thus, introducing the argumentation aspect in the information retrieval procedure recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present our participation at the CLEF 2021 Touché Lab for the second shared task, which tackles answering comparative questions based on arguments. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-layer architecture where the argument extraction task is considered as the main engine. Our approach therefore is a pipeline of query expansion, argument identification based on DistilBert model, and sorting the documents by a combination of different ranking criteria.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Argumentation is a fundamental aspect of human communication and decision making. It can be defined as the logical reasoning humans use to derive a conclusion or justify their perspectives on a specific topic.</p><p>An argument consists of two elementary components: one or more premises and one claim (conclusion) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,146.54,513.48,11.50,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Argument mining is the automatic identification or extraction of arguments from unlabeled input text such as news articles, scientific papers, legal documents, reviews, and debates. Hence, argument mining has been investigated in various applications such as assisted writing and legal counselling. Furthermore, the arguments can serve as the keystone of an intelligent web search engine for question answering. In this context, the Webis Group 1 organized an argumentation retrieval event "Touché Lab at CLEF 2021" 2 that consists of two independent shared tasks: 1) Argument Retrieval for Controversial Questions and 2) Argument Retrieval for Comparative Questions. We present in this paper our adopted approach for participation as "Rayla Team" in the latter shared task. The main objective of this task is to support users facing some choice problem in their daily life. Given a comparative question (for instance, "Which is better, a Mac or a PC?"), the goal is to retrieve documents from the ClueWeb12 corpus <ref type="foot" coords="2,176.96,152.96,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">3</ref> , and rank them based on different criteria, mainly, the arguments they provide.</p><p>In order to have more granularity control, our proposed architecture incorporates several units, each one performs a specific sub-task, namely: query expansion, argument extraction, scoring, and sorting.</p><p>The Touché organizers gave the option to use their own tool, TARGER <ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.08,222.46,16.44,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, for the argument retrieval sub-task by providing a simple REST API to interact with. However, since this is the main block in our proposed pipeline, we decided to develop our own module based on the latest developments in the field of deep learning. Therefore, we implemented a new transfer learning model for Argument Identification based on DistilBert <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.94,276.66,11.36,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a distilled version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,350.44,290.20,11.41,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>: smaller, faster, and lighter, with 97% of its language understanding capabilities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,300.15,303.75,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we go through a conceptual background of argument mining and the recent usage of transfer learning models towards it . In Section 3, we present our retrieving system architecture as well as the function of each unit. We discuss the proposed approach in Section 5. Finally, we summarize the main achievements in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Argument Retrieval</head><p>Argumentative text identification is generally the first step of a complete argument mining system, then comes the argument components detection, and finally, the argument structure identification that considers the support and attack relations. State-of-the-art literature reports mainly classical machine learning models and very few attempts to use deep learning models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,110.24,505.29,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,124.32,505.29,7.47,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.52,505.29,7.30,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>).</p><p>In a classical machine learning model, the training and testing data are used for the same task and follow the same distribution. However, transfer learning aims to transfer previous learned knowledge from one source task (or domain) to a different target one, considering that source and target tasks and domains may be the same or may be different but related <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.01,559.49,12.51,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>This can be useful in the argument mining domain from different perspectives. First of all, common knowledge about the language is obviously appreciated. Second, transfer learning can solve or at least help to solve one of the biggest challenges in the argument mining field, the lack of labeled datasets. Third, even available datasets are often of small size and very domain and task dependent. They may follow different annotations, argument schemes, and various feature spaces. This means that in each potential application of argument mining, we need argument experts to label a significant amount of data for the task at hand, which is definitely an expensive work in terms of time and human-effort. Hence, transfer learning will fine-tune pre-trained knowledge on a big dataset to serve another problem, and that's why we built on it for the argument identification stage.</p><p>Looking at the literature, we found only two studies addressing transfer learning models for argumentation tasks published in 2020. The first one is towards discriminating evidence related to Argumentation Schemes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,212.41,168.26,12.77,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> where the authors train classifiers on the sentence embeddings extracted from different pre-trained transformers. The second one is by Wambsganss et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,89.29,195.36,12.93,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> where the authors proposed an approach for argument identification using BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,464.79,195.36,15.39,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Our transfer learning model is based on a distilled version of BERT, proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="3,427.71,208.91,11.39,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which retains 97% of the language understanding capabilities of the base BERT model, with a 40% less in size, and being 60% faster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Comparative Question Answering</head><p>Question answering is a sophisticated form of information retrieval that started to develop as a field decades ago. However, with the growth of world wide web data, as well as of private databases, the need for more precise answers, well-expressed and shortly formulated is growing, too. Hence, several studies are devoted to the representation of natural language stated in the query and in the documents.</p><p>Extracting the arguments stated in the document is one way to clearly capture the grounded statements (premises) and the final conclusion (claim) presented in the text. Therefore, many recent works focus on the arguments as a potential tool for improving comparative question answering <ref type="bibr" coords="3,137.74,394.13,16.33,10.91" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,156.78,394.13,12.25,10.91" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Improving a retrieval model for argument-based comparison systems is the target of the Touché's Task 2, which has been addressed in 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,375.95,407.68,17.91,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as well.</p><p>The best result of last year was introduced by the team "Bilbo Baggins" of Abye et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,460.91,421.23,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. They used a two-step approach: 1) query expansion by antonyms and synonyms, and 2) document ranking based on three measures: relevance, credibility, and support features. An overall score is deduced by summing up those three scores after weights multiplication. Eventually this approach can be improved by keeping the same pipeline and enhance the inner sub-tasks. For instance, instead of using a static classifier 'XGBoost' for the comparative sentence classification, a BERT-based model can ameliorate the robustness of the classifier and extend its operating range. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,132.51,516.07,16.38,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Johannes Huck participated with a simple approach, the original topic is used as a single query to be sent to ChatNoir, and retrieve the top 20 documents. After documents retrieval, the author uses the TARGER API <ref type="bibr" coords="3,273.83,543.17,12.69,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in order to extract arguments from each document, claims and premises are treated as arguments without any distinction. For the re-ranking, the BM25 algorithm has been used to determine the relevance of the extracted arguments with respect to the original query <ref type="bibr" coords="3,220.45,583.82,16.37,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Despite the simplicity of this implementation and the lack of introducing several measures in the ranking process, this approach could be integrated as one component in a bigger architecture in order to add an extra measure that may improve the stability of the overall system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach and Implementation</head><p>In this section, we present our proposed approach and adopted methods to build a search engine for answering comparative questions based on argumentation identification. The overall architecture of our approach is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,313.44,138.38,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It composes of a sequence of seven stages. We go through them individually in the upcoming sections. We used the same architecture to submit four runs with different configurations via TIRA platform <ref type="bibr" coords="4,381.55,165.48,16.25,10.91" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Query Expansion</head><note type="other">Topic</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Query Expansion</head><p>Query Expansion (QE) is the process of reformulating a given query to improve retrieval performance and increase the recall of the candidate retrieval (i.e. to match additional documents). Our query expansion module involves a variety of techniques in order to generate three different queries to be passed to the next step, as the following:</p><p>• Query 1: is the original query itself.</p><p>• Query 2: is generated from the original query by: (1) removing English stop words, punctuation marks, and comparison adjectives or also called comparison operators. (2) Stemming of the remaining words to their base forms, and aggregating them together with conjunctive AND operator.</p><p>• Query 3: will be generated from the original query only if the latter contains a comparison operator, as follows:</p><p>-Search for synonyms and/or antonyms of the comparison operator of the query to get what is called the context of the comparison operator, whose size is 5 synonyms/antonyms in our case. -Remove English stop words and punctuation.</p><p>-Eliminate the comparison operator from the original query and transform the remaining words/terms to their base form. -We create 5 queries out of the original query (after the pre-specified changes: removing English stop words, punctuation and comparison operators), and each time adding one of the 5 synonyms/antonyms from the context of the comparison operator.</p><p>Those 5 output queries are sent to ChatNoir as one disjunctive OR-query: Query 3.</p><p>Comparison adjectives identification and words stemming are done automatically using using spaCy <ref type="foot" coords="5,117.41,278.87,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">4</ref> . Synonyms and antonyms are hard-coded in the software due to the limited number of comparative operators in the topics of this year and the last year (10 adjectives in total). In Table <ref type="table" coords="5,115.59,307.72,5.03,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> we show an example of the query expansion output for the Topic 61 from Touché 2021 topics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Retrieving the Documents by ChatNoir API</head><p>The ClueWeb12 document dataset for this task is easily accessible through the ChatNoir API<ref type="foot" coords="5,108.90,567.98,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">5</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="5,116.04,569.73,16.55,10.91" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,135.53,569.73,14.11,10.91" target="#b16">17]</ref> that is based on the BM25F ranking algorithm. The BM25, also known as Best Matching 25 is a ranking method used by several search engines to determine the relevance of documents with regards to a query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework and it is considered as the state-of-the-art among TF-IDF-like algorithms in information retrieval. BM25F is just a newer version of BM25 that takes the structure of documents into consideration.</p><p>The API takes a query as input, in our case we retrieve 40 documents for each of the 3 queries. The interaction with this API can be done using either GET or POST requests, several parameters could be included in the request to specify the corpus to retrieve from, and the type of returned information. It supports also a set of standard operators from web search services, and queries can be concatenated using Boolean operators, -, ". . . ", site:. . . etc.. In our approach, we used only POST requests, AND and OR operators to concatenate strings in Query 2 and Query 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Documents Aggregation</head><p>As Query 3 may be empty, we have a minimum of 80 and a maximum of 120 retrieved documents. Every document has a unique id (uuid), which we use to remove the redundant documents returned by more than one query. As a result we get N documents. One important remark at this phase, is that when removing a redundant document, we preserve its importance by including its retrieved scores (from ChatNoir) to the scores of the remaining unique document (having a unique uuid). This is done by summing up individual scores to obtain a single score for each set of redundant documents.</p><p>Initially, the ChatNoir API does not respond with the full content of the documents. Instead, it returns some metadata, including the unique uuid. To get a document full content, a new query is sent to ChatNoir to request the full HTML source page. Later on, we need to reveal only the main textual content from the HTML document. We achieve that by removing tags, advertisements and other cleaning processes. For that end, we used two HTML cleaning libraries: Boilerpy3<ref type="foot" coords="6,133.02,378.82,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">6</ref> and Trafilatura <ref type="foot" coords="6,209.38,378.82,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">7</ref> .</p><p>Both libraries are powerful and able to perform the main text extraction most of the time. However, the output of the two libraries is not always the same. In some cases, Trafilatura performs better than Boilerpy3 and extracts more text content, while the latter outperforms in other cases/documents. For this reason, we are using both libraries to extract the HTML content, the results are split into sentences and we take the union of those sentences in order to cover the entire main content of the document. The final list of sentences is sent to the Argument Extraction module, where each document is presented as a set of sentences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Argument Extraction</head><p>In our particular task, we seek to detect the comparative sentences in the document, therefore, argument identification can be sufficient. Hence, we take the sentences from the document aggregation step and apply binary classification using the model presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,465.64,552.25,5.04,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref> to label every sentence as an argument or Non-argument. Therefore, we searched for datasets that contain both argument and non-argument labels. Student Essays <ref type="bibr" coords="6,381.00,579.35,17.93,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Web discourse <ref type="bibr" coords="6,488.05,579.35,17.93,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> are public, very common used corpora which well satisfy this purpose.</p><p>The Student Essays corpus contains 402 Essays about 8 controversial topics. The annotation covers the following argument components: 'major claim', 'claim' and 'premise'. In addition, it shows the support/attack relations between them. Thus, it could be used in several argument mining tasks.</p><p>The User-generated Web Discourse corpus is a smaller dataset that contains 340 documents about 6 controversial topics in education such as homeschooling. The document may refer to an article, blog post, comment, or forum posts. This dataset is considered noisy, unrestricted and less formalized. The annotation has been done by <ref type="bibr" coords="7,331.38,154.71,17.89,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> according to Toulmin's model <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.37,154.71,16.24,10.91" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Thus, it covers the following argument components: 'claim', 'premise', 'backing' and 'rebuttal'.</p><p>In order to deduct binary-labeled unified data for both corpora, we label any argument component (premise or claim) as an 'argument', and the rest of the text sentences as 'nonargument'.</p><p>The choice of BERT-based model is justified by the fact that among different existent transformers, BERT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,156.47,236.01,12.74,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref> has recently gained a lot of attention. It seems to achieve the state of the art results in several NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="7,214.28,249.56,11.36,10.91" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,228.36,249.56,7.47,10.91" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,238.56,249.56,7.47,10.91" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,248.76,249.56,12.32,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>For our particular task, we performed different experiments using several BERT-based models (BERT base, RoBERTa-base <ref type="bibr" coords="7,207.62,276.66,20.41,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, DistilRoBERTa , DistilBERT) <ref type="foot" coords="7,365.64,274.90,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">8</ref> and we achieved very similar results. Hence, we decided to use the DistilBERT model given that it is 40% less than BERT in size with a relevant in-line performance and a faster training/ testing time <ref type="bibr" coords="7,422.15,303.75,11.43,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.    <ref type="formula" coords="7,404.16,488.65,3.80,10.91">3</ref>) It adds the necessary padding to preserve the unique size for all sentences (we set 128 as a maximum length). The second block is the DistilBERT fine-tuned model that outputs mainly a vector of length of 768 (default length). In order to adapt the output of this pre-trained model to our specific task, we add a third block, which is a linear layer applied on top of the DistilBERT transformer, and outputs a vector of size 2. In this vector, the index of the maximum value reflects the predicted class id (Or simply it is the 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 of the output vector). We trained the model for 3 epochs, using AdamW <ref type="bibr" coords="7,156.07,583.50,17.91,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as an optimizer and Cross Entropy for the loss calculation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Scoring</head><p>This step is essential for any search engine system because users usually check out the first result links. Therefore, our objective now is to estimate the best matching between the query and the candidate answers, in order to sort them at the final stage. For that end, we investigate different scores based on different aspects. First of all, the document relevance which can be checked by ChatNoir BM25 score and Query hit count. However, even if a document content is relevant to the query, it may be faked or biased, we inspect the credibility of the document itself by considering: Page Rank score as well as Spam rank score.</p><p>Moreover, as we built our retrieval system based on arguments, we takes into consideration the argument quality level by three different scores: argument support, query-argument similarity, and argument BM25 score.</p><p>The complete details of our ranking scores are:</p><p>1. ChatNoir score: Returned form ChatNoir API indicating BM25 measure. 2. Query hit count: Indicates how many times the document is retrieved by the three queries <ref type="bibr" coords="8,146.19,365.14,12.70,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,158.88,365.14,8.46,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. 3. Page Rank score: Returned form ChatNoir API measuring the importance of the source website pages. 4. Spam rank score: Returned form ChatNoir API indicating the probability of the website to be a spam. 5. Argument support score: Represents the ratio of argument sentences among all existent sentences in the document. 6. Similarity score: Evaluates the similarity of two sentences based on the context and English language understanding using the SentenceTransformer<ref type="foot" coords="8,366.89,476.39,3.54,7.10" target="#foot_6">9</ref> library <ref type="bibr" coords="8,407.26,477.41,16.41,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. We calculate the similarity between the original query and every argumentative sentence in the document, and consider the average as the score. 7. Arg-BM25 score: Calculated on argumentative sentences of each document with respect to the original query. This is done through re-indexing the retrieved documents by creating new ones that contain only argumentative sentences. Then the arg-BM25 score of each document is calculated by querying the new argumentative documents with the original topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Normalization and Scores Combination</head><p>Furthermore, for the final score, we normalize all previously calculated scores, so that all values are between 0 and 1. These scores are summed up using particular weights. The setting up of the scoring weights is fixed manually based on the announced relevance judgments of last year </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation</head><p>The shown architecture in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="9,244.75,509.62,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents our base approach, from which we derive four submissions to the task-2 of Touché 2021 by modifying score weights and the number of retrieved and submitted documents. In Table <ref type="table" coords="9,288.66,536.71,3.69,10.91" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, we present the used score weights for each run in addition to the number of submitted documents per topic, scores id are defined in Section 3.5. The results of each submission are conducted by the Touché committee through the manual labeling of the documents with the help of human assessors. For each run, two evaluation scores are calculated that defines the relevance and the rhetorical quality of the submitted documents. For the quality evaluation, our team Rayla comes out on top of the ranking list by achieving a score of nDCG@5= 0.675. While we are ranked third with respect to the relevance evaluation with an nDCG@5 score of 0.427. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,262.82,631.56,4.98,10.91" target="#tab_4">4</ref> presents in more details the achievements of each run in more details. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>The proposed approach presents an advanced web search engine to answer comparative questions, each component in the architecture presented in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,376.90,258.57,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> plays an important role to achieve the best retrieval results. For instance, the query expansion component tries to make a first selection and build a set of topic-related documents. The three different queries generated from the original topic increase the coverage of the related documents and this works very well with the ChatNoir API since it is a basic BM25 retrieval system. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,126.97,326.32,5.06,10.91" target="#tab_2">2</ref> presents the results of our DistilBERT model to accomplish the binary classification task (argument / non-argument) at the sentence level on different corpora. It shows that our DistilBERT model results are in-line to recent work of Wambsganss. et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="10,418.94,353.42,11.40,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, it achieves very good results in argument classification with an accuracy of 0.8587 with respect to the merged corpora. Furthermore, the model is built on top of a text processing transformer, DistilBERT, and it is powered by English knowledge understanding, which makes the trained argument identification model scale on a wide variety of English topics and texts.</p><p>In order to re-rank the initially retrieved documents, as mentioned in Section 3.5, we included several measures in the final score calculation. Those measures define the importance of the document in terms of three criteria: (1) document relevance, (2) whether sufficient argumentative support is provided, and (3) trustworthiness and credibility. For the document relevance criteria, the ChatNoir score and the query-hit reflect well whether a document is relevant enough to the topic, while the spam rank score and the page rank score reveal the trustworthiness and credibility of the web page. For the argument support, three different scores are being considered, argument support score, argument similarity score and argument BM25 score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented our participation at the shared task of argument retrieval for answering comparative questions. Our approach consists of a pipeline of several components for query expansion, retrieving the documents, extracting the arguments, and ranking them respectively. A main contribution is the transfer learning model we developed based on the DistilBert transformer, and using two different datasets for adapting it to the argument identification task. In addition, we consider different criteria to re-rank the output documents with respect to their relevance, the argument they contain, and their trustworthiness and credibility. In future work, we plan to use more advanced techniques for better query enrichment, in addition to using a machine learning model that learns the best weights of the scores mentioned in Section 3.5.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,89.29,491.39,232.51,8.93"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Global architecture of the submitted approach</figDesc></figure>

The first block is the Tokenizer that takes care of all the BERT input requirements, by doing the following: (1) It transforms the words of a sentence into an array of DistilBERT tokens. (2) It adds the special starting token ([CLS] token). (3) It adds the necessary padding to preserve the unique size for all sentences (we set 128 as a maximum length). The second block is the DistilBERT fine-tuned model that outputs mainly a vector of length of 768 (default length). In order to adapt the output of this pre-trained model to our specific task, we add a third block, which is a linear layer applied on top of the DistilBERT transformer, and outputs a vector of size 2. In this vector, the index of the maximum value reflects the predicted class id (Or simply it is the 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 of the output vector). We trained the model for 3 epochs, using AdamW<ref type="bibr" coords="7,156.07,583.50,17.91,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as an optimizer and Cross Entropy for the loss calculation.</figDesc></figure>
