<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Task 2 of CLEF eRisk 2021 challenge focuses on early prediction of self-harm based on sequentially processing pieces of text over social media. The workshop has organized three tasks this year and released different corpora for the individual tasks and these are developed using the posts and comments over Reddit, a popular social media. The text mining group at Center for Computational Biology in University of Birmingham, UK has participated in Task 2 of this challenge and submitted five runs for five different text mining frameworks. The paper explore the performance of different text mining techniques for early risk prediction of self-harm. The techniques involve various classifiers and feature engineering schemes. The simple bag of words model and the Doc2Vec based document embeddings have been used to build features from free text. Subsequently, ada boost, random forest, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used to identify self-harm from the given texts. The experimental analysis on the test corpus show that the SVM classifier using the conventional bag of words model outperforms the other methods for identifying self-harm. This framework achieves best score in terms of precision among all the submissions of eRisk 2021 challenge for identifying self harm over social media.</p></div>

The information available over social media is a rich source for sentiment analysis or inferring mental health issues <ref type="bibr" coords="1,281.99,573.26,11.58,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The CLEF eRisk 2021 shared task focuses on early prediction of self harm over social media. The main goal of eRisk 2021 challenge is to instigate discussion on the creation of reusable benchmarks for evaluating early risk detection algorithms by exploring issues of evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics and other processes related to the creation of test collections for early detection of self harm <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.65,127.61,11.58,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.

Self harm is a type of suicide attempts that leads to death most of the times. It is associated with a number of adverse outcomes, and is strongly associated with future suicide <ref type="bibr" coords="2,395.19,236.01,11.49,10.91" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,409.44,236.01,7.65,10.91" target="#b6">7]</ref>.

However, it is generally difficult to identify self harm from the early symptoms. The treatment for these diseases can be started on time, if the alarming symptoms are diagnosed properly. The recent research has focused on identifying self-harm from medical records using machine learning and text mining approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,471.75,303.75,11.47,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,485.95,303.75,7.51,10.91" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.20,303.75,7.64,10.91" target="#b4">5]</ref>.

In order to extract relevant features, they followed a sliding window approach that handles the last messages published by any given user. The features considered a wide range of variables, such as title length, words in the title, punctuation, emoticons, and other feature sets obtained from sentiment analysis, first person pronouns and words of non-suicidal self-injury <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.56,534.09,16.43,10.91" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.71,534.09,12.32,10.91" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, different text mining frameworks have been developed to identify self harm over social media data released as part of eRisk 2021 shared task. The aim is to train a machine learning classifier using the given training corpus to classify individual documents of the test corpus. The performance of a text classification technique is highly dependent on the potential features of a corpus. Therefore the performance of different classifiers have been tested following different feature engineering techniques. The conventional bag of words model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.46,628.93,18.06,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the Doc2Vec based deep learning model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,269.38,642.48,16.44,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.54,642.48,14.03,10.91" target="#b17">18]</ref> have been used to generate features from the given corpora. We have explored two different term weighting schemes of the bag of words model, viz., term frequency and inverse frequency (TF-IDF) based term weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="2,488.13,669.58,17.86,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and entropy based term weighting scheme <ref type="bibr" coords="3,281.23,86.97,16.43,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,300.38,86.97,12.32,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Subsequently, the performance of ada boost <ref type="bibr" coords="3,295.11,114.06,16.15,10.91" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, logistic regression <ref type="bibr" coords="3,400.58,114.06,16.15,10.91" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, random forest <ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.17,114.06,17.81,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and support vector machine <ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.07,127.61,17.79,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref> classifiers have been reported using the bag of words features and the Doc2Vec based features individually on the training corpus following 10 fold cross validation. Therefore, the best five frameworks are chosen based on their performance on the training corpus in terms of fmeasure and subsequently they have been implemented on the test corpus. The experimental results show that the support vector machine classifier using TF-IDF based term weighting scheme outperforms the other frameworks on the test corpus in terms of precision. Moreover, this framework achieves the best precision score among all the runs submitted in Task 2 of the eRisk 2021 shared task.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. The proposed text mining frameworks are explained in section 2. Section 3 describes the experimental evaluation. The conclusion is presented in section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Proposed Frameworks</head><p>Various text mining frameworks have been proposed here to identify the documents that indicate the risk of self harm from the given corpus. The documents of the corpus are released in XML format. Each XML document contains the posts or comments of a Reddit user over a period of time with the corresponding dates. We have extracted the posts or comments from the XML documents and ignored the other entries. Therefore the corpus used for experiments in this article contain only the free texts related to different posts over Reddit for individual users. Different types of features are considered to build the proposed frameworks to identify self harm using state of the art classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Feature Engineering Techniques</head><p>There are different feature engineering techniques exist in the literature of text mining. We have considered both raw text features and semantic features in the proposed methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Bag Of Words Features</head><p>The text documents are generally represented by the bag of words model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,422.72,542.73,16.55,10.91" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.00,542.73,12.59,10.91" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,457.33,542.73,12.41,10.91" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In this model, each document in a corpus is generally represented by a vector, whose length is equal to the number of unique terms, also known as vocabulary <ref type="bibr" coords="3,337.41,569.83,16.25,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Let us denote the number of documents of the corpus and the number of terms of the vocabulary by 𝑛 and 𝑚 respectively. Number of times the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ term 𝑡 𝑖 occurs in the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ document is denoted by 𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑚; 𝑗 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑛. The documents can be efficiently represented following the vector space model in most of the text mining algorithms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,402.66,624.03,16.09,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In this model each document 𝑑 𝑗 is considered to be a vector 𝑑 𝑗 ⃗ , where the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ component of the vector is say, 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 , i.e., 𝑑 𝑗 ⃗ = (𝑊 1𝑗 , 𝑊 2𝑗 , ..., 𝑊 𝑚𝑗 ). There are different term weighting schemes in the literature to represent the weights of a document vector. However, we have used the following two term weighting schemes to represent the bag of words, which are widely used in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="4,89.29,100.52,16.43,10.91" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,108.45,100.52,12.55,10.91" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,123.72,100.52,12.55,10.91" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,138.99,100.52,12.32,10.91" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>The conventional term weighting scheme is known as term frequency and inverse document frequency or TF-IDF. Document frequency, say, 𝑑𝑓 𝑖 is the number of documents in which the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ term appears. Inverse document frequency determines how frequently a term occurs in a corpus and it is defined as 𝑖𝑑𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔( 𝑛 𝑑𝑓 𝑖 ). The weight of the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ term in the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ document, denoted by 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 , is determined by combining the term frequency with the inverse document frequency as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,120.92,204.53,333.50,25.50">𝑊 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗 × 𝑖𝑑𝑓 𝑖 = 𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗 × 𝑙𝑜𝑔( 𝑁 𝑑𝑓 𝑖 ), ∀ 𝑖 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑚 and ∀ 𝑗 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑛</formula><p>The entropy based term weighting technique is used by many researchers to form termdocument matrix from free text data <ref type="bibr" coords="4,249.17,253.93,16.31,10.91" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,267.88,253.93,12.23,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>. This method reflects the assumption that the more important term is the more frequent one that occurs in fewer documents, taking the distribution of the term over the corpus into account <ref type="bibr" coords="4,267.96,281.03,16.09,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Thus the weight of a term 𝑡 𝑖 in the 𝑗 𝑡ℎ document, denoted by 𝑊 𝑖𝑗 , is determined by the entropy based technique<ref type="foot" coords="4,367.63,292.82,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" coords="4,374.56,294.58,17.91,10.91" target="#b20">[21]</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="4,132.13,316.98,193.81,42.12">𝑊 𝑖𝑗 = log(𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗 + 1) × (︃ 1 + 𝑛 ∑︀ 𝑗=1 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 log 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 log(𝑛 + 1)</formula><p>)︃</p><p>, where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,398.88,334.61,62.12,39.94">𝑃 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗 𝑛 ∑︀ 𝑗=1 𝑡𝑓 𝑖𝑗</formula><p>The term-document matrices developed by the bag of words models are generally sparse and high dimensional. The same may have adverse affect on the quality of the classifiers. Hence significant terms related to different categories of a corpus are to be determined. Many term selection techniques are available in the literature. The term selection methods rank the terms in the vocabulary according to different criterion function and then a fixed number of top terms forms the resultant set of features. A widely used term selection technique is 𝜒 2 -statistic <ref type="bibr" coords="4,488.04,454.81,17.95,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and this is used in the proposed frameworks. We have considered different number of terms generated by 𝜒 2 -statistic and evaluated the performance of individual classifiers using these set of terms on the training corpus. The best set of terms are used for experiments on the test corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Doc2Vec Based Features</head><p>A Doc2Vec model can express a document as a vector. We can evaluate semantic similarity between two documents by comparing the corresponding vectors. Doc2Vec model is based on Word2Vec model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,185.90,585.43,16.41,10.91" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which expresses a word as a vector. In a vector space produced by a Word2Vec model, two words which are similar in meaning correspond to two vectors which are close to each other <ref type="bibr" coords="4,224.46,612.53,16.41,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Furthermore, the relationship among words is consistent throughout vector operations, e.g., "king -man + woman = queen" <ref type="bibr" coords="4,378.11,626.08,16.09,10.91" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Doc2Vec is an extension of Word2Vec to learn document level embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="4,320.55,639.63,16.55,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,340.31,639.63,12.42,10.91" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Its algorithm is implemented in Gensim<ref type="foot" coords="5,124.03,85.21,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , a Python library. The Doc2Vec model is trained on the training corpus to generate the embeddings from individual documents. The features of the test documents are inferred from these embeddings learned over the training corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Text Classification Techniques</head><p>Different text classification methods have been used to identify self harm in the given test corpus using bag of words features and features generated by Doc2Vec model. The proposed frameworks are developed using Ada Boost (AB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.</p><p>SVM is widely used for text classification <ref type="bibr" coords="5,290.18,231.54,16.41,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The linear kernel is recommended for text classification as the linear kernel performs well when there is a lot of features <ref type="bibr" coords="5,427.67,245.09,16.08,10.91" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Hence linear SVM is used in the experiments.</p><p>Random Forest is an ensemble of decision tree classifier, which is trained with the bagging method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result. It has shown good results for binary class text classification problems <ref type="bibr" coords="5,89.29,326.38,16.23,10.91" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Analysis of Results</head><p>Initially, we have implemented four classifiers using three different feature engineering schemes individually on the training corpus. The performance of these frameworks are reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,116.92,458.94,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> in terms of Precision, Recall and Fmeasure. These results are useful to analyze the performance of different proposed frameworks. Thereafter, the top five frameworks from Table <ref type="table" coords="6,501.01,472.49,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> in terms of fmeasure have been selected and subsequently implemented on the given test corpus.</p><p>Eventually the performance of these five frameworks on the test corpus are communicated as official results of our team.</p><p>It can be seen from Table <ref type="table" coords="6,212.28,540.23,4.97,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> that SVM performs better than the other classifiers using Entropy based term weighting scheme following fmeasure. SVM outperforms the other classifiers for TF-IDF based term weighting scheme too in terms of fmeasure. For Doc2Vec based features, Ada Boost beats the other classifiers based on fmeasure. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,379.73,580.88,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that random forest classifier using both entropy based features and Doc2Vec based features cannot beat the other three frameworks, but they perform better than the rest of the methods in terms of fmeasure. Thus we have chosen these five frameworks following their performance on the training corpus as reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,180.47,635.08,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and have run them on the test corpus.</p><p>The results of the five runs on the test corpus in terms of precision, recall, fmeasure, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 [33], 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 50 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,158.29,211.97,16.12,10.91" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 <ref type="bibr" coords="7,234.68,211.97,12.72,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and speed <ref type="bibr" coords="7,296.75,211.97,12.71,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , are reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,411.66,211.97,3.68,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. It can be seen from this table that the precision of the Birmingham 2 framework is better than the precision of the other Birmingham frameworks and it is the best precision score among the precision scores of all 55 submissions in Task 2 of eRisk2021 challenge. Birmingham 0 framework outperforms the other Birmingham frameworks in terms of recall, f-measure, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 , 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 50 , 𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 and speed, but its performance does not belong to the top three scores of all the submissions of Task 2 in eRisk 2021 challenge.</p><p>The latency and speed are two important measures for early prediction of risk of a disease over internet <ref type="bibr" coords="7,150.03,333.92,11.45,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The latency and speed of the proposed frameworks are reasonably well, but many teams perform better than us in terms of speed and latency. In future we should look into this issue to improve the speed and latency. The bag of words model and SVM classifier generally perform well for classical text classification tasks. However, this framework can not achieve the semantic interpretation of the words in free texts. Hence it does not perform very well for text data over internet as these data sets contain irregular texts of diverse meaning. The deep learning based model can get rid of this situation and therefore we used the Doc2Vec based model to capture the semantic interpretation of the online texts. It can be observed from Table <ref type="table" coords="7,116.54,442.31,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> that Doc2Vec based model could not perform well on the test corpus like the bag of words model. The deep learning based models works well when trained on large corpora <ref type="bibr" coords="7,487.36,455.86,16.24,10.91" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The Doc2Vec based model performs poorly as we have trained it on the training corpus of the eRisk 2021 self-harm identification task, which is reasonably small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>The Task 2 of eRisk 2021 challenge aims to develop text mining tools for early prediction of risk of self harm over social media. Various text mining frameworks have been presented here using different types of features from the free text to accomplish this task. We have examined the performance of both bag of words features and Doc2Vec based features using different classifiers to identify signs of self harm. It has been observed from the experimental results that the conventional bag of words model performs better than the Doc2Vec model on the test corpus. Note that we have developed the Doc2Vec based embeddings based on the given training corpus, which has reasonably low number of documents in compare to the other pretrained deep learning based word embeddings e.g., Glove, which were trained on huge text collections. As a result the Doc2Vec model cannot properly represent the semantic interpretations of the given documents and hence its performance is not as good as the classical bag of words model. In future we can develop a large training corpus by collecting data from Reddit and similar forums for early risk prediction of self harm. Furthermore, we plan to develop some pretrained transformer based embeddings for depression and other mental disorders by collecting documents over social media, Wikipedia and publications to further improve the performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="6,88.99,90.49,378.63,94.91"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Overview of Five Different Runs</figDesc><table coords="6,127.66,116.35,339.96,69.04"><row><cell>Runs</cell><cell>Frameworks</cell><cell>Number of Features</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Birmingham 0 Entropy Based Features and SVM Classifier</cell><cell>3000</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Birmingham 1 Entropy Based Features and RF Classifier</cell><cell>3000</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Birmingham 2 TF-IDF Based Features and SVM Classifier</cell><cell>2500</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Birmingham 3 Doc2Vec Based Features and AB Classifier</cell><cell>50</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Birmingham 4 Doc2Vec Based Features and RF Classifier</cell><cell>50</cell></row></table></figure>
