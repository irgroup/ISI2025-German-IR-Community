<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The primary goal of eRisk is to investigate topics such as evaluation methodologies, metrics, and other factors relevant to developing research collections and identifying problems for early risk identification. Early detection technologies have the potential to be useful in a variety of fields, especially those related to safety and health. Early alerts may be issued, for example, when a person begins to exhibit symptoms of a psychotic illness, when a sexual abuser begins interacting with an infant, or when a suspected criminal begins publishing antisocial threats on the Internet.</p><p>While the evaluation methodology (strategies for developing new research sets, innovative evaluation metrics, etc.) can be extended across various domains, eRisk has so far concentrated on psychological issues (essentially, depression, self-harm and eating disorders). We conducted an exploratory task on the early diagnosis of depression in 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,387.65,127.61,11.48,10.91">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,402.44,127.61,7.65,10.91">2]</ref>. This pilot task was focused on the evaluation methods and test dataset described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,374.00,141.16,11.36,10.91">[3]</ref>. In 2018, we continued the task on early identification of symptoms of depression while also launching a new task on early detection of signs of anorexia <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.21,168.26,11.30,10.91" target="#b27">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,236.25,168.26,7.53,10.91">5]</ref>. In 2019, we ran the continuation of the challenge on early identification of symptoms of anorexia, a challenge on early detection of signs of self-harm, and a third task aimed at estimating a user's responses to a depression questionnaire focused on her social media interactions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,218.25,208.91,11.25,10.91">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.22,208.91,7.43,10.91" target="#b30">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,242.37,208.91,7.50,10.91">8]</ref>. Finally, in 2020, we continued with the early detection of self-harm and the task on severity estimation of depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.40,222.46,11.36,10.91">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,418.48,222.46,12.55,10.91" target="#b33">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,433.76,222.46,12.32,10.91">11]</ref>. Over the years, we've been able to compare a variety of solutions that use diverse technologies and models (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, or Information Retrieval). We discovered that the interplay between psychological disorders and language use is challenging and that the effectiveness of most contributing systems is low. For example, most participants had performance levels (e.g., in terms of F1) that were less than 70%. This suggests that this kind of early prediction tasks requires additional investigation, and the solutions offered so far have a lot of space for improvement. In 2021, the lab had three campaign-style tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,308.69,330.85,16.42,10.91" target="#b35">[12]</ref>. The first task explores a new domain: pathological gambling. We designed this new task in the same fashion as previous early detection challenges. The second task is a continuation of the early detection of the self-harm task. Finally, we provided the third edition of the depression severity estimation task, where participants were required to analyse the user's posts and then estimate the user's answers to a standard depression questionnaire. These tasks are described in greater detail in the next sections of this overview article. We had 76 teams registered for the lab. We finally received results from 18 of them: 26 runs for Task 1, 55 runs for Task 2 and 36 for Task 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Task 1: Early Detection of Pathological Gambling</head><p>This was a new task in 2021. The challenge was to conduct a study on early risk detection of pathological gambling. Pathological gambling (ICD-10-CM code F63.0) is also called ludomania and usually referred to as gambling addiction (it is an urge to gamble independently of its negative consequences). According to the World Health Organization <ref type="bibr" coords="2,379.29,524.97,16.22,10.91">[13]</ref>, in 2017, adult gambling addiction had prevalence rates ranged from 0.1% to 6.0%. The task entailed sequentially processing evidence and detecting early signs of pathological gambling, also known as compulsive gambling or disordered gambling, as soon as possible. The task is primarily concerned with evaluating Text Mining solutions and focuses on texts written in Social Media. Participating systems had to read and process the posts in the order in which they were created on Social Media. As a result, systems that effectively perform this task could be used to sequentially monitor user interactions in blogs, social networks, and other types of online media. The test collection for this task had the same format as the collection described in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.47,633.36,11.58,10.91">[3]</ref>. The source of data is also the same used for previous eRisks. It is a collection of writings (posts or comments) from a set of Social Media users. There are two categories of users, pathological gamblers and non-pathological gamblers, and, for each user, the collection contains a sequence of writings (in chronological order). We set up a server that iteratively gave user writings to the participating teams. More information about the server can be found at the lab website <ref type="foot" coords="3,476.44,249.27,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . This was an "only test" task. No training data was provided to the participants. The test stage consisted of participants connecting to our server and iteratively receiving user writings and sending responses. At any point in the user chronology, each participant could stop and issue an alert. After reading each user post, the teams had to choose between: i) alerting about the user (the system predicts the user will develop the risk) or ii) not alerting about the user. Alerts were regarded as final (i.e. further decisions about this individual were ignored), while no alerts were considered as non-final (i.e. the participants could later submit an alert about this user if they detected the appearance of signs of risk). This choice had to be made for each user in the test split. The accuracy of the decisions and the number of user writings required to make the decisions were used to evaluate the systems (see below). To support the testing stage, we deployed a REST service. The server iteratively distributed user writings to each participant while waiting for their responses (no new user data was distributed to a specific participant until the service received a decision from that team). The service was open for submissions from February 1st, 2021, until April 23rd 2021. In order to build the ground truth assessments, we followed existing approaches that optimize the use of assessors time <ref type="bibr" coords="3,199.32,467.81,16.31,10.91" target="#b37">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,218.31,467.81,12.23,10.91" target="#b38">15]</ref>. These methods allow to build test collections using simulated pooling strategies. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,197.19,481.36,4.97,10.91">1</ref> reports the main statistics of the test collection used for T1. Evaluation measures are discussed in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Decision-based Evaluation</head><p>This form of evaluation revolves around the (binary) decisions taken for each user by the participating systems. Besides standard classification measures (Precision, Recall and F1<ref type="foot" coords="3,497.22,556.43,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> ), we computed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, the early risk detection error used in previous editions of the lab. A full description of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,285.26,585.29,11.58,10.91">[3]</ref>. Essentially, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is an error measure that introduces a penalty for late correct alerts (true positives). The penalty grows with the delay in emitting the alert, and the delay is measured here as the number of user posts that had to be processed before making the alert.</p><p>Since 2019, we complemented the evaluation report with additional decision-based metrics that try to capture additional aspects of the problem. These metrics try to overcome some limitations of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸, namely:</p><p>• the penalty associated to true positives goes quickly to 1. This is due to the functional form of the cost function (sigmoid). • a perfect system, which detects the true positive case right after the first round of messages (first chunk), does not get error equal to 0. • with a method based on releasing data in a chunk-based way (as it was done in 2017 and 2018) the contribution of each user to the performance evaluation has a large variance (different for users with few writings per chunk vs users with many writings per chunk). • 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is not interpretable. Some research teams have analysed these issues and proposed alternative ways for evaluation. Trotzek and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="4,191.55,277.53,17.76,10.91" target="#b39">[16]</ref> proposed 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . This is a variant of ERDE that does not depend on the number of user writings seen before the alert but, instead, it depends on the percentage of user writings seen before the alert. In this way, user's contributions to the evaluation are normalized (currently, all users weight the same). However, there is an important limitation of 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 % 𝑜 . In real life applications, the overall number of user writings is not known in advance. Social Media users post contents online and screening tools have to make predictions with the evidence seen. In practice, you do not know when (and if) a user's thread of messages is exhausted. Thus, the performance metric should not depend on knowledge about the total number of user writings. Another proposal of an alternative evaluation metric for early risk prediction was done by Sadeque and colleagues <ref type="bibr" coords="4,195.19,413.02,16.10,10.91">[17]</ref>. They proposed 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 , which fits better with our purposes. This measure is described next. Imagine a user 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 and an early risk detection system that iteratively analyzes 𝑢's writings (e.g. in chronological order, as they appear in Social Media) and, after analyzing 𝑘 𝑢 user writings (𝑘 𝑢 ≥ 1), takes a binary decision 𝑑 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, which represents the decision of the system about the user being a risk case. By 𝑔 𝑢 ∈ {0, 1}, we refer to the user's golden truth label. A key component of an early risk evaluation should be the delay on detecting true positives (we do not want systems to detect these cases too late). Therefore, a first and intuitive measure of delay can be defined as follows <ref type="foot" coords="4,227.34,519.66,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,184.61,559.48,321.37,12.74">latency 𝑇 𝑃 = median{𝑘 𝑢 : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1}<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This measure of latency is calculated over the true positives detected by the system and assesses the system's delay based on the median number of writings that the system had to process to detect such positive cases. This measure can be included in the experimental report together with standard measures such as Precision (P), Recall (R) and the F-measure (F): </p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,228.19,274.81,277.80,25.50">𝑃 = |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1| |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 1|<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,228.34,304.57,277.65,25.50">𝑅 = |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1| |𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 : 𝑔 𝑢 = 1|<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,228.17,333.60,277.81,24.43">𝐹 = 2 • 𝑃 • 𝑅 𝑃 + 𝑅<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, Sadeque et al. proposed a measure, 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 , which combines the effectiveness of the decision (estimated with the F measure) and the delay<ref type="foot" coords="5,340.90,380.04,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">4</ref> in the decision. This is calculated by multiplying F by a penalty factor based on the median delay. More specifically, each individual (true positive) decision, taken after reading 𝑘 𝑢 writings, is assigned the following penalty:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,202.86,442.16,303.12,24.89">𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) = -1 + 2 1 + exp -𝑝•(𝑘𝑢-1)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝑝 is a parameter that determines how quickly the penalty should increase. In <ref type="bibr" coords="5,457.82,478.48,16.11,10.91">[17]</ref>, 𝑝 was set such that the penalty equals 0.5 at the median number of posts of a user <ref type="foot" coords="5,430.49,490.28,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_5">5</ref> . Observe that a decision right after the first writing has no penalty (i.e. 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(1) = 0). Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,453.60,505.58,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> plots how the latency penalty increases with the number of observed writings. The system's overall speed factor is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,158.27,570.74,347.72,11.36">𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 = (1 -median{𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑢 = 1})<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where speed equals 1 for a system whose true positives are detected right at the first writing. A slow system, which detects true positives after hundreds of writings, will be assigned a speed score near 0.</p><p>Finally, the latency-weighted F score is simply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="6,244.56,110.72,261.42,11.50">𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝐹 • 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Since 2019 user's data were processed by the participants in a post by post basis (i.e. we avoided a chunk-based release of data). Under these conditions, the evaluation approach has the following properties:</p><p>• smooth grow of penalties; • a perfect system gets 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 1 ;</p><p>• for each user 𝑢 the system can opt to stop at any point 𝑘 𝑢 and, therefore, now we do not have the effect of an imbalanced importance of users; • 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 is more interpretable than 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Ranking-based Evaluation</head><p>This section discusses an alternative form of evaluation, which was used as a complement of the evaluation described above. After each release of data (new user writing) the participants had to send back the following information (for each user in the collection): i) a decision for the user (alert/no alert), which was used to compute the decision-based metrics discussed above, and ii) a score that represents the user's level of risk (estimated from the evidence seen so far). We used these scores to build a ranking of users in decreasing estimation of risk. For each participating system, we have one ranking at each point (i.e., ranking after 1 writing, ranking after 2 writings, etc.). This simulates a continuous re-ranking approach based on the evidence seen so far. In a real life application, this ranking would be presented to an expert user who could take decisions (e.g. by inspecting the rankings). Each ranking can be scored with standard IR metrics, such as P@10 or NDCG. We therefore report the ranking-based performance of the systems after seeing 𝑘 writings (with varying 𝑘).</p></div>

This run, however, shows poor performance in terms of classification accuracy. The majority of teams made quick decisions. Overall, these findings indicate that some systems achieved a relatively high level of effectiveness with only a few dozen user submissions. Social and public health systems may use the best predictive algorithms to assist expert humans in detecting signs of pathological gambling as early as possible. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,115.31,594.92,4.97,10.91">4</ref> presents the ranking-based results. Because some teams only processed a few dozens of user writings, we could only compute their user rankings for the initial number of processsed writings. Some runs (e.g., UNSL runs #0 #1 #2, RELAI #2) have the same levels of ranking-based shallow effectiveness over multiple points (after one writing, after 100 writings, and so forth). However, for the 100 cut-off, only UNSL #2 obtains the highest NDCG after one writing. This run is consistently the best performing one in terms of ranking for every cut-off, metric and number of writings. The UPV-Symanto team seems to have some bug on their model as it consistently yielded zero performance. In summary, UNSL #2 is overall the best performing run in ranking and decision-based evaluation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="8,124.10,194.80,340.54,21.09">1 1 0.81 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 UNSL 1<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="8,124.10,374.13,267.87,68.91">UPV-Symanto 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 UPV-Symanto 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 UPV-Symanto 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 UPV-Symanto 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 UPV-Symanto 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 CeDRI 0 0.</formula></div>

This task proposes the early risk detection of self-harm in the very same way as described for pathological gambling in Section 2. The test collection for this task also had the same format as the collection described in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,468.59,363.53,11.58,10.91">[3]</ref>. The source of data is also the same used for previous eRisks. Here are two categories of users, selfharm and non-self-harm, and, for each user, the collection contains a sequence of writings (in chronological order). We set up a server that iteratively gave user writings to the participating teams. More information about the server can be found at the lab website <ref type="foot" coords="9,416.56,415.97,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_6">6</ref> . This was a train and a test task. The test phase followed the same procedure as Task 1 (see Section 2). For the training stage, the teams had access to training data where we released the whole history of writings for training users. We indicated what users had explicitly mentioned that they had done self-harm. The participants could therefore tune their systems with the training data. In 2021, the training data for Task 2 was composed of all 2019's Task 2 users and 2020's Task 1 test users. Again, we followed existing methods to build the assessments using simulated pooling strategies, which optimize the use of assessors time <ref type="bibr" coords="9,269.02,526.12,16.31,10.91" target="#b37">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,288.00,526.12,12.23,10.91" target="#b38">15]</ref>.

The lapse of time is indicative of the degree of automation of each team's algorithms. A few of the submitted runs processed the entire thread of messages (about 2000), but many variants opted for stopping earlier or were not able to process the users' history in time. Only one team was able to process the entire set of writings in a reasonable amount of time (around a day or so for processing the entire history of user messages). The remaining teams took several days to complete the process. Some teams required more than a week. Again, this suggests that they used some form of offline processing. This run seems to be quite balanced overall. When comparing the best values with the ones from last year, the best values for Precision and F1 are lower than those reported in 2020. This year the amount of released training data more than doubled, but the availability of a larger training set was apparently no beneficial for the 2021 participants. Therefore, these results seem to suggest the need of models that better exploit existing information. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,115.35,547.91,4.98,10.91" target="#tab_8">8</ref> presents the ranking-based results. Some runs perform equally for some of the rankingbased effectiveness over different cut-off values (e.g., UNSL runs #0 #3 #4 after one writing or NLP-UNED#4, BLUE #2 or UPV-Symanto #0 and #3 after 100 writings). After 500 and 1000 writings, RELAI #1 obtains the best values for shallow cut-offs. UNSL #4 obtains the highest NDCG and Precision at the 10 cut-off after one writing and very good values under the other situations. This seems to point out that this effective run keeps the same good overall behaviour as in the case of the decision-based evaluation.

The task consists of estimating the degree of depression based on a thread of user submissions. Participants were given the full history of postings for each user (in a single release of data), and they were required to fill out a standard depression questionnaire based on the evidence found in the history of postings. Participants in 2021 had the option of using 2019 and 2020 data as training data (filled questionnaires and social media submissions from the users, i.e. a training set composed of 90 users).</p><p>The questionnaire is derived from the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) <ref type="bibr" coords="13,403.62,206.12,16.09,10.91" target="#b41">[18]</ref>, which assesses the presence of feelings like sadness, pessimism, loss of energy, etc, for the detection of depression. The questionnaire contains the 21 questions reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="13,367.18,233.22,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_11">9</ref>. The task aims at exploring the viability of automatically estimating the severity of the multiple symptoms associated with depression. Given the user's history of writings, the algorithms had to estimate the user's response to each individual question. We collected questionnaires filled by Social Media users together with their history of writings (we extracted each history of writings right after the user provided us with the filled questionnaire). The questionnaires filled by the users (ground truth) were used to assess the quality of the responses provided by the participating systems. The participants were given a dataset with 80 test users and they were asked to produce a file with the following structure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="15,89.29,595.12,231.45,35.01">username1 answer1 answer2 .... answer21 username2 .... ....</formula><p>Each line has a user identifier and 21 values. These values correspond to the responses to the questions of the depression questionnaire (the possible values are 0, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b -for questions 16 and 18-and 0, 1, 2, 3 -for the rest of the questions-).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Task 3: Evaluation Metrics</head><p>For consistency purposes, we employed the same evaluation metrics utilised in 2019 and 2020. These metrics assess the quality of a questionnaire filled by a system in comparison with the real questionnaire filled by the actual Social Media user:</p><p>• Average Hit Rate (AHR): Hit Rate (HR) averaged over all users. HR is a stringent measure that computes the ratio of cases where the automatic questionnaire has the same answer as the actual answers to the questionnaire. For example, an automatic questionnaire with five matches gets HR equal to 5/21 (because there are 21 questions in the form). Imagine that the real user answered "0". A system S1 whose answer is "3" should be penalised more than a system S2 whose answer is "1". For each question, CR computes the absolute difference (ad) between the real and the automated answer (e.g. ad=3 and ad=1 for S1 and S2, respectively) and, next, this absolute difference is transformed into an effectiveness score as follows: 𝐶𝑅 = (𝑚𝑎𝑑 -𝑎𝑑)/𝑚𝑎𝑑, where 𝑚𝑎𝑑 is the maximum absolute difference, which is equal to the number of possible answers minus one<ref type="foot" coords="16,474.35,413.99,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_7">7</ref> • Average DODL (ADODL): Difference between overall depression levels (DODL) averaged over all users. The previous measures assess the systems' ability to answer each question in the form. DODL, instead, does not look at question-level hits or differences but computes the overall depression level (sum of all the answers) for the real and automated questionnaire and, next, the absolute difference (𝑎𝑑_𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙) between the real and the automated score is computed. Depression levels are integers between 0 and 63 and, thus, DODL is normalised into [0,1] as follows: 𝐷𝑂𝐷𝐿 = (63 -𝑎𝑑_𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙)/63. • Depression Category Hit Rate (DCHR). In the psychological domain, it is customary to associate depression levels with the following categories:</p><p>minimal depression (depression levels 0-9) mild depression (depression levels 10-18) moderate depression (depression levels <ref type="bibr" coords="16,348.01,608.98,11.87,7.91">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b44">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b45">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b46">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b47">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b48">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b49">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b50">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,359.88,608.98,5.93,7.91" target="#b51">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,365.82,608.98,17.80,7.91" target="#b52">[29]</ref> severe depression (depression levels 30-63)</p><p>The last effectiveness measure consists of computing the fraction of cases where the automated questionnaire led to a depression category that is equivalent to the depression category obtained from the real questionnaire.</p></div>

These results do not improve but are aligned with the results obtained in the tasks of previous years (eRisk's Task 3 in 2019 and Task 2 in 2020), whose best AHR ratios were around 40%. This suggests that analyzing user posts can help extract some signals or symptoms related to depression. In the case of ACR, the best performing run (UPV-Symanto 4_symanto_upv_lingfeat_cor) shows a 73.17%, exceeding the 70% ACR barrier established in previous years, which represents a sustained improvement in the results of this metric for this task. However, this value is only slightly better than the näive all 1s algorithm (72.90%). This metric penalizes high distances between the correct answer and the answer given by the system and, thus, it somehow favours conservative answers. By always choosing 1, the all 1s algorithm sets an upper limit of the distance equal to 2 (it gets 2 when the correct answer is 3). In terms of AHR, some participating runs outperform the näive baseline algorithms (all 1s = 23.03%, all 0s = 32.02%). This implies that the distance-based ACR metric penalizes system failures in estimating response to an item more effectively. These results put forth an existing barrier in the generalization process: from the specific estimation of individual answers (to each question in the questionnaire) to the overall estimation of the subject's depression level. In terms of ADODL, the best run (CYUT run 2) shows rates around 83.59%, representing a tiny percentage improvement compared to previous years (the best ADODL result obtained in Task 2 2020 was 83.15%).</p><p>Several teams offer values greater than 80% in the ADODL metric, strengthening the values obtained in previous years. However, the difficulty in the generalization process is clearly appreciated when we analyze the DCHR metric. In this case, the best performing run (CYUT run 2) gets the depression category right for only 41.25% of the individuals. This result is slightly lower than the maximum obtained in previous years (around 45% of individuals in Task 2 2020). This value is better than the baseline variants but, still, there is much room for improvement, and the trend in the data remains consistent throughout successive editions. These results confirm the task's viability for automatically extracting some depression-related evidence from social media activity. Still, there is a need to improve the generalization process in order to advance towards a more comprehensive, more effective depression screening tool. Some of our future plans include to further analyze the participants' estimations (e.g., to determine which particular BDI questions are easier or harder to answer automatically) and to study whether or not specific questions of the questionnaire are more influential to the global depression score (ADODL and DCHR). </p></div>

RELAI <ref type="bibr" coords="19,124.93,397.81,17.86,9.77">[19]</ref>. The team of the Université du Québec à Montréal (Canada). Regarding T1, the team approach includes some external and existing testimonials' data and self-evaluation questionnaire results for a distance-based model. For T2, two approaches based on neural networks were tested. One is based on the Contextualizer encoder, while the other is based on RoBERTa embeddings. Finally, the team presented a similarity-based model for T3, computing the similarities of the writings of the test subjects to those of the training subjects. These representations were based on topic modelling or neural encoders trained on authorship decisions. The team also tested some variations on similarity-based regression and a nearest-neighbours approach. UPV-Symanto <ref type="bibr" coords="19,162.01,506.20,17.86,9.77">[20]</ref>. This team is composed of researchers from Universitat Politécnica de Valencia, Symanto Research, and from the University of Bucharest. The team participated in the three tasks. Task 1 and Task 2 collected external information from Reddit (800 users T1 and 46 users from T2). For T1, they trained a Transformer-based classifier over Bert. Task 2 repeated the same approach as in Task 1 but also tested Hierarchical Attention Networks with different linguistic features (GloVe embeddings, style, LIWC, etc.). Finally, for T3, they tested two approaches. The first is based on a temporal user representation based on the evolution of some of the linguistics features over time. In the second one, the UPV-Symanto team trains a classifier based on RoBRoBERTaERTA over external data from Reddit. Then they use the CLS embeddings from the user posts (averaged) for training 21 classifiers (one per question) BLUE <ref type="bibr" coords="19,120.08,641.69,17.84,9.77" target="#b44">[21]</ref>. This is a team from the University of Bucharest (Romania). They present models using BERT transformers and automatic data crawling from mental health subreddits on all three tasks. They follow a data acquisition approach similar to last years' iLab team. They used the same model for producing the runs but different training data (different combinations of eRisk Training data and crawled data) or thresholds for the different tasks. UNSL <ref type="bibr" coords="20,119.82,114.06,16.09,10.91" target="#b45">[22]</ref>. This team is a collaboration between Universidad Nacional de San Luis (UNSL) and the Instituto de Matemática Aplicada San Luis (IMASL), both in Argentina. The team proposed a general overview of both T1 and T2 focusing on the delay aspect of the early risk detection problem called Early Risk Detection Framework (ERD), that explicitly identifies how the classification with partial information (CPI) component, which is the risky-user classification model is implemented, and how the deciding the moment of classification (DMC) component makes its decisions (the early alert policy). Applying the general framework, the team presented different feature variants and configurations of the parameters of the ERD framework to address T1. For t2, the team presented five different models, including doc2vec variants and configurations of the parameters of the ERD framework. . This is a team from the National Center for Text Mining, University of Manchester, United Kingdom. They implemented a host of models for Task 3 based on neural networks. They experimented with pre-trained language models for feature extraction from all user's posts (ELMo, BERT, and SpanEmo). Then, they trained a random forest classifier on top of that extracted features. They also evaluated different layers in the SpanEmo method determining which one is best for obtaining better results. CYUT <ref type="bibr" coords="21,123.43,101.44,17.86,9.77" target="#b51">[28]</ref>. This is a team from the Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan. They approached Task 3. For that, they employed a RoBERTa pre-trained model for each BDI item to classify all the posts of each user. They tested three different approaches to obtain a user-level estimation from post-level from the post-level predictions obtaining the final estimations. DUTH-ATHENA <ref type="bibr" coords="21,174.13,155.64,17.84,9.77" target="#b52">[29]</ref>. From Democritus University of Thrace and Athena Research Center, this team, Xanthi, Greece, implemented three different approaches to fill the BDI questionnaire (Task 3) automatically. In the first two approaches, they use a sentence-based language model, called SBERT, to represent the subjects' posts and employ cosine similarity and well-known classifiers, such as SVM and Random Forests, to classify each user in the options of each BDI item. In the third approach, they fine-tune a RoBERTa model to estimate the answers of the subjects of the collection. uOttawa <ref type="bibr" coords="21,133.83,250.48,17.79,9.77" target="#b53">[30]</ref>. This the team from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Canada. They presented several deep learning methods for Task 3. They perform a pre-filtering process based on the relevance of posts on the data. After that, they experimented with various classification variants, including transfer learning techniques (Zeroshot learning) and Question Answering (QA) systems, such as BERT and Universal Sentence Encoder QA. Unior-NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="21,145.88,331.78,17.83,9.77" target="#b54">[31]</ref>. This is a team from "L' Orientale", University of Naples, Italy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper provided an overview of eRisk 2021. The fifth edition of this lab focused on two types of tasks. On the one hand, two tasks were on early detection of pathological gambling and self-harm (Task 1 and 2, respectively), where participants had sequential access to the user's social media posts and had to send alerts about at-risk individuals. On the other hand, one task was released to measuring the severity of the signs of depression (Task 3), where the participants were given the full user history, and their systems had to automatically estimate the user's responses to a standard depression questionnaire The proposed tasks received 117 runs from 18 teams in total. Although the effectiveness of the proposed solutions is still limited, the experimental results show that evidence extracted from social media is valuable, and automatic or semi-automatic screening tools could be developed to detect at-risk individuals. These results encourage us to further investigate the development of benchmarks for text-based screening of risk indicators.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,89.29,216.34,324.08,9.43"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Latency penalty increases with the number of observed writings (𝑘 𝑢 )</figDesc></figure>

The team from the Research Center for Digitalization and Intelligent Robotics (CeDRI), at Instituto Politécnico de Bragança, (Portugal) participated in T1 and T2. For T1, the team contribution is focused on creating new training data in a post-level automatic annotation effort. With that data, the team used logistic regressors, CNNs, and LSTM classifiers. Regarding the self-harm task, this group employed the provided training data. Still, selected submissions to focus on the contents that are more related to self-harm (based on a non-suicidal self-injury vocabulary) and employed similar classifiers. The team from the Center for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, UK) participated in T2. This group focused on standard (and mostly classic) machine learning methods (testing AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM), together with standard weighting schemes and feature selection techniques such as bag of words or doc2vec based features.
