<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes the participation of the CeDRI team in eRisk 2021 tasks, particularly, the Task 1: Early Detection of Signs of Pathological Gambling and Task 2: Early Detection of Signs of Self-Harm. The main difference between these two is that the first is a "test only" challenge, where no training data is supplied. The second task has labeled data available, which can be used for training. Both tasks were addressed using the same algorithms, using a custom training set for Task 1 and the provided data in the second. The algorithms were TfIdf vectorizer with a Logistic Regression layer, Word2Vec vectorizer with LSTM and Word2Vec vectorizer with CNN. All vectorizers and Neural Networks were trained solely with the training data. As expected, the algorithms did not state-of-the-art, but the experience allowed to reflect in several aspects related to the importance of proper dataset preparation and processing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The term social network refers to a person's connections to other people. In fact, creating and maintaining social networks provide opportunities to connect with others who have similar interests. Although initially applied in the context of "real-world" or physical, the concept expanded to also include platforms that support online communication, such as Instagram, Twitter or Reddit. Digital platforms further enhance these opportunities, allowing forming relationships with people never met in person. Geographical barriers are attenuated or eliminated, allowing to actively engage with people around the world. They can explore their curiosity, pick up hobbies, or just spend time online. The possibility to write, participate or communicate without restrictions also provides a means to unburden or receive emotional support. Some people resort to social networks to talk about their state of mind, their feelings, distresses and other problems.</p><p>In opposition to verbal and direct communication, the content available in the social networks is persistent, allowing asynchronous access data and providing a good means for psychological and health related studies and analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="1,262.93,566.63,11.31,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,276.97,566.63,7.46,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,287.16,566.63,7.54,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. According to several findings, people's mental state can be inferred from their social networks narratives <ref type="bibr" coords="1,348.82,580.18,11.30,10.91" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,362.84,580.18,7.53,10.91" target="#b5">5]</ref>. Based in this, the CLEF eRisk challenges harness this opportunity to explore issues of evaluation methodologies, performance metrics and other aspects related to building test collections and defining challenges for early risk detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,152.88,100.52,11.36,10.91" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.96,100.52,7.47,10.91" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.16,100.52,7.47,10.91" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.36,100.52,7.57,10.91" target="#b9">9]</ref>. This year's challenge has three tasks. Task 1, on early risk detection of pathological gambling, and Task 2, on early risk detection of self-harm, consist of sequentially processing pieces of evidence and detect early traces of pathological gambling and self-harm , respectively, as soon as possible. Task 3, measuring the severity of the signs of depression, consists of estimating the level of depression from a thread of user submissions. The CeDRI team participated in Task 1 and Task 2, where users' posts are processed in the same order in which they are sent, to chronologically monitor the users' activity.</p><p>This paper presents the participation of the CeDRI team in the pathological gambling and in the self-harm early detection challenges of CLEF 2021. In task 1, two runs where executed, using a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep neural networks, both with Word2Vec embeddings. Task 2 used three runs, with LSTM, CNN with Word2Vec embeddings, like the previous task, and a logistic regression layer with Tf-Idf vectorizer. Although the results were very close within the runs, the best results in Task 1 was latency-weighted F1=0.141 (with the LSTM) and in Task 2 latency-weighted F1=0.206 (with the CNN).</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers the considerations regarding the datasets, while section 3 introduces the proposed method. Analysis of the results of experiments are presented in section 4 and finally, the conclusion and suggested directions for future works are presented in section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dataset</head><p>The machine learning area is characterized by three main approaches of learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,452.51,416.58,16.39,10.91" target="#b10">[10]</ref>:</p><p>• supervised -maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs; • unsupervised -patterns are learned without any explicit feedback; • reinforcement -learns from a series of reinforcements, such as rewards and punishments. These are applied in several areas and with several purposes, such as classification, prediction, estimation, affinity grouping, clustering and profiling. The eRisk challenge Task 1 and 2 is mainly a classification problem, widely approached with supervised learning methods. In these problems, a learning agent is shown what to do through an annotated set of training examples, and it is expect an automated learning algorithm to generalize from these examples.</p><p>For this, it is fundamental to understand and make sure that the training data is adequate and it is well labeled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Text pre-processing</head><p>Social networks' posts often include tokens that do not represent words, such as URLs, HTML entities, users' handles, or others. Some of these do not bring relevant information to infer the psychological condition of the user and may affect the performance of classification. The pre-processing applied in both tasks included the following operations:</p><p>• unescape html entities (ex: &amp;lt; or &amp;#60;) • remove handles (@abcd @pqrs) • remove URLs (https://erisk.irlab.org) • normalize lengthening (111111 -&gt; 11; kkkkkkkkkkk -&gt; kk)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,107.28,145.99,217.36,69.93">• remove numbers • convert to lowercase (Tomorrow -&gt; tomorrow) • strip punctuation • tokenize • perform stemming</formula><p>The vocabulary is substantially reduced, as well as the word variations (Table <ref type="table" coords="3,449.12,227.08,3.59,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The same pre-processing approach was applied in both tasks (sections 2.2 and 2.3). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Task 1: pathological gambling dataset</head><p>The challenge consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence and detect early traces of pathological gambling signs in texts written in Social Media. This was an "only test" task, so no training data was provided. The test collection format is a collection of writings (posts or comments) from a set of Social Media users, labeling two categories of users, pathological gamblers and non-pathological gamblers, and, for each user, the collection contains a sequence of writings (in chronological order) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,248.85,506.99,16.25,10.91" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Since the challenge did not provide labeled data, a custom dataset, based on Reddit, was built. For that, the Python Pushshift.io API Wrapper (PSAW -https://github.com/dmarx/ psaw) was used to retrieve posts from the Pushshift initiative (https://pushshift.io), in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. This allowed to remove the limit of 1000 posts that could be downloaded from Reddit directly. The dataset was built based on the r/GamblingAddiction and r/problemgambling communities. In addition, a random set of posts was also downloaded to complement the dataset with non-gambling related content (Table <ref type="table" coords="3,398.37,601.84,3.57,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>There is a considerable number of posts available after downloading, in a total of 73064 referring gambling issues and 47103 posts of random subjects. However, extracting data from the CSV files failed in many posts, having only 7079 posts and 2306, respectively. This was due to incompatibility issues between the post text and the CSV encoding, related to the appearance of commas (', ') in the text and unterminated '"', which made the issue of extracting the columns Each post was stored in a single file, prefixed with pos or neg followed by a number (e.g. pos_1762.txt, neg_2032.txt). It was decided not to associate or track the users, so each post is individual and not related to any other.</p><p>After building the dataset, the most frequent tokens in the gambling related posts (1a) and in the non-gambling related posts (1b) were calculated (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,352.76,280.32,3.51,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). As expected, tokens like gambi, monei, or stop appear in the vocabulary for gambling posts. For random, like, know and would are very frequent.  Next, the same operation was performed for bi-grams, to better understand the context of the words (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,170.56,537.07,3.57,10.91" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</p><p>In these, feel like is transversal to both types of posts, although credit card and gambli addict, for example, are clearly indicating the type of posts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Task 2: self-harm dataset</head><p>The training data provided XML files for 340 subjects, 41 of which belonging to the self-harm group, 299 to the control group (Table <ref type="table" coords="4,260.55,627.45,3.56,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). The total number of writings in the self-harm group is 7,192 posts in contrast to 163,506 in the control group. The difference between the groups is also very significant in the average number of writings per subject: 175.4 in the self-harm group and 546.8 in the control group. The average length of the users' (subjects') writings is  179.1 and 129.2 respectively, and the number of tokens is 15.12 and 10.6. Although the control subjects write more posts, they are, in average, shorter. The dataset is also provided with the test writing, in the same format. They are also present in table <ref type="table" coords="5,369.71,326.78,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, for completeness. In addition, not all posts are of the same language. Using OpenNLP's language detection model, a total of 81 different languages were counted. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,372.24,601.42,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_3">4</ref> show the 15 more frequent languages within the writings.</p><p>The dataset uses binary labels on the subjects, as having (positive) and not-having (negative) self-harm (ground truth). As seen in table <ref type="table" coords="5,284.01,642.07,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, each subject has an arbitrary number of posts, and it is not expected that all of them will be strictly related to whether an user self-harms or not. The main approach in this work, is to use a machine learning approach that uses text to predict whether a message belongs to a positive or negative user, so the classifier should not be trained with just the ground truth. Some selection on the posts have to be made, so that only the self-harm related writings are kept as positive samples in the training set.</p><p>Based on Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) words <ref type="bibr" coords="6,317.98,383.13,16.37,10.91" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, a selection was made on the posts to extract individual writings to be used as positive examples. The examples were written in two directories (pos/ for positive and neg/ for negative) with the following name schema: subject280_2.txt, where the first number is the subject number and the second is this subject's post number. After selecting writings based on NSSI words, and excluding all languages except English, a total of 391 positive labeled writings remained. For balance, the same number of negative labeled writings were selected.</p><p>The tokens frequency were also extracted from both the positive and the negative writings. In this case, the bi-grams (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,237.59,491.52,4.16,10.91" target="#fig_5">3</ref>) and tri-grams (Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,346.35,491.52,4.16,10.91" target="#fig_6">4</ref>) are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed methods</head><p>This section presents the models and experiments conducted for the eRisk 2021 task. First, the classification methods require that text be converted to vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Vectorizers</head><p>All the methods rely on the vectorization of the subjects' writings. Two vectorizers were trained, based on TfIdf and Word2Vec, both with the same text pre-processing techniques (section 2.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• TfIdf:</head><p>minimum word frequency = 2;   • Word2Vec:</p><p>minimum word frequency = 5; -number of iterations = 1; -number of epochs = 5; -layer size = 128; -window size = 5;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Classifiers</head><p>Three classification models were build for the tasks. The first is a simple Logistic Regression layer using the TfIdf vectorizer, used in both Tasks 1 and 2:</p><p>• output dimension = 2;</p><p>• weight initialization algorithm = XAVIER;</p><p>• activation = SOFTMAX;</p><p>• optimization algorithm = STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT;</p><p>• updater = Nesterovs(0.1, 0.9)</p><p>• batch size = 32;</p><p>Another classifier was built using a CNN with Word2Vec vectors as input, used only in Task 2: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Analysis of the results</head><p>In task 1, according to the eRisk 2021 evaluation report, the maximum number of all users writings was 2000. Of these, only 271 were processed, in 1 day 5 hours, 44 minutes and 10 seconds, until the servers were shutdown. The unavailability, at the time, of an additional GPU made the processing time much slower and, as such, 1 day was not enough to process the whole set. Two runs were executed, based on LSTM and TfIdf (Table <ref type="table" coords="8,366.97,585.23,3.57,10.91" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>The final results are far from the best in all metrics. Nevertheless, the LSTM performed better, although marginally, than TfIdf, a much simpler classifier.</p><p>In task 2, the maximum number of all users writings were 1999. Of these, only 369 were processed, taking 1 day 9 hours, 51 minutes and 27 seconds. As before, and although a GPU was available in this task, the system was not able to process the totality of test users until the server was shutdown. Three runs were executed, based on LSTM, CNN and TfIdf (Table <ref type="table" coords="8,483.30,666.52,3.57,10.91">6</ref>). It seemed that the CNN performed better in some metrics, although marginally, compared with LSTM, with TfIdf getting very low scores. Moreover, the algorithms seems to be highly inclined to emit positive decisions, with perfect recall but extremely low precision. Although it is not clear, this may be due to the fact that the posts are processed individually, without any consideration of the previous writings. Some window or accumulator approach could be used to understand if this is the issue.</p><p>Overall, the three methods can be improved. They were rather close, which gives the indication that the main issue is with the selection of the training dataset. A deeper understanding is necessary regarding the dataset and, after that, new methods can be devised and tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>This paper describes the CeDRI submission to the CLEF eRisk 2021 task 1 and 2 on detecting early signs of pathological gambling and self-harm in social media posts. Three methods were presented that seek to classify each writing independently of the others using only information about the text. The first task is a "test only", so it was necessary to build a training set based on posts collected from Reddit. Task 2 required the processing and filtering of the writings in order to isolate the posts that refer to self-harm from the others, and use these for training the classifiers.</p><p>Due to the simple classifiers used, state-of-the-art results were not expected. The main purpose was to try to understand the effectiveness of building training sets based on simple heuristics filters. For future work, the inclusion of more features, such as Part of Speech (PoS) frequency, post date and time, and others should be studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,129.29,470.25,107.22,9.96;4,347.80,470.25,128.57,9.96"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>(a) gambling related posts.
