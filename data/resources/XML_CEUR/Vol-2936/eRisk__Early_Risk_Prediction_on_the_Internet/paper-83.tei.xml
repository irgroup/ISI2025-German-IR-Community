<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the participation of the RELAI team in the eRisk 2021 shared tasks. Since 2017, the eRisk shared tasks have aimed to invite innovation in Natural Language Processing and other artificial intelligence-based methods towards the assessment of possible risks to mental health based on online behavior <ref type="bibr" coords="1,269.15,434.18,11.49,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In 2021, three tasks were put forth. The first task (Task 1) introduced the problem of detecting the signs of pathological gambling. The second task (Task 2), a continuation of Tasks 2 and 1 from 2019 and 2020, respectively, focuses on the assessment of the risk of self-harm. Finally, continuing from Tasks 3 and 2 from 2019 and 2020, Task 3 asked participants to predict the severity of depression symptoms as defined by a standard clinical questionnaire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Evaluation</head><p>Performance is measured both on the ultimate decision made on each subject, using binary classification metrics, and the predicted scores, using ranking metrics. The classification metrics include standard precision, recall and the associated 𝐹 1 score, as well as Early Risk Detection Error (𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸), 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 , 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 and 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 . In addition to accounting for the binary prediction on a given subject, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 seeks to account for the timeliness of that prediction by counting the number of writings processed by the predicting algorithm before producing a positive prediction. Given 𝑡 𝑢 , 𝑝 𝑢 , respectively the ground truth and predicted labels for a given subject, 𝑘 𝑢 the number of processed writings, and a given threshold 𝑜, the 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,179.85,508.27,229.41,52.94">𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 𝑜 (𝑝 𝑢 , 𝑡 𝑢 , 𝑘) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 𝑐 𝑓 𝑝 if 𝑝 𝑢 ̸ = 𝑡 𝑢 = 0 1 if 𝑝 𝑢 ̸ = 𝑡 𝑢 = 1 1 1+𝑒 𝑜-𝑘 if 𝑝 𝑢 = 𝑡 𝑢 = 1 0 otherwise</formula><p>Here, 𝑐 𝑓 𝑝 is a constant set to the rate of positive subjects in the test set. This per-subject 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 is averaged across the test set, and is to be minimized. Thus, false negatives are counted as errors, and false positives are counted as a fraction of an error in proportion to the number of positive subjects. The delay in decision is only considered for true positive prediction, where a standard sigmoid function counts the number of writings processed, 𝑘, offset by the chosen threshold, 𝑜. As with the other classification metrics used, true negatives are disregarded. 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 was evaluated at 𝑜 = 5 and 𝑜 = 50.</p><p>Likewise, 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 measures the median delay in true positive predictions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,189.30,112.21,216.68,10.69">𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑇 𝑃 = 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛{𝑘 𝑢 : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑝 𝑢 = 𝑡 𝑢 = 1}</formula><p>Similarly, 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 and 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,222.24,135.98,13.00,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> are computed by penalizing this delay albeit in a smoother manner:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,168.46,163.81,258.36,36.47">𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 = 1 -median {𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) : 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈, 𝑝 𝑢 = 𝑡 𝑢 = 1} 𝐹 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝐹 1 • 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑.</formula><p>The individual penalty is given by a logistic function and depends on a scaling parameter, 𝑝:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,220.06,231.09,153.46,24.43">𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦(𝑘 𝑢 ) = -1 + 2 1 + 𝑒 -𝑝𝑘𝑢-1</formula><p>The scores attached to each subject are used to rank them. This ranking is evaluated by standard information retrieval metrics: 𝑃 @10, 𝑁 𝐷𝐶𝐺@10 and 𝑁 𝐷𝐶𝐺@100. These are evaluated after 1, 100, 500 and 1000 writings have been processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Approaches and Training</head><p>Having no annotated training data at hand, data available on the web were exploited for both training and prediction. Two authorship attribution approaches were put forward for this task. In both cases, our approaches assess whether a test user belongs to a set of gambling testimonials using a similarity distance measure between their textual productions. A test user 𝑢 is said to be at risk of pathological gambling if the minimal similarity distance 𝛿 𝑢 𝑚𝑖𝑛 computed for them is smaller than a threshold 𝜃.</p><p>Since topic modeling have shown good potential in such authorship attribution task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,491.75,423.86,11.58,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, it is selected to represent both test users' textual production and the testimonials. Given the performances of the Embedding Topic Model (ETM) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,321.63,450.96,12.77,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref> in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.64,450.96,16.17,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, this model is selected for topic extraction. Our ETM model is trained on a corpus made from two datasets. The first part is made from the textual productions from the Subreddits Problem Gambling<ref type="foot" coords="3,392.15,476.31,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and Gambling Addiction Support<ref type="foot" coords="3,122.91,489.86,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , ensuring the presence of gambling-related vocabulary in the corpus. The second part is made up of control subjects from the 2018 eRisk depression dataset, adding general topics to the corpus. Both gambling-related and control content were added in equal part to this novel training corpus in order to limit any discrepancies.</p><p>The ETM is trained following the methodology described in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.25,545.81,16.08,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Using the trained model, the test user's textual productions and the testimonials are mapped to a vector of topic probabilities, which are then used in our two authorship attribution approaches to compute the similarity. Here, the similarity is given by computing the Hellinger distance between two vectors of topic probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Testimonials</head><p>Our first approach consists in using testimonials found on the Web to assess the pathological gambling risk of the users from the test data. The testimonials offered by 199 compulsive gamblers were found on Gambler's Help<ref type="foot" coords="4,247.25,132.88,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . These testimonials are considered to be our testimonials set 𝑇 = {𝑡 1 , . . . , 𝑡 199 }.</p><p>Here, we aim to find the minimal similarity distance threshold 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 to be considered at risk of pathological gambling by using the testimonials set 𝑇 . Then, every testimonial 𝑡 ∈ 𝑇 is compared to the others using a one-against-all cross validation technique, i.e. 1 vs. 198 testimonials, to compute its distance 𝛿 𝑡 from every other testimonial. A testimonial 𝑡 is represented by its vector of topic probabilities 𝑡 ⃗ , which allows to compute the Hellinger distance between testimonials 𝑡 𝑖 and 𝑡 𝑗 , as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,241.14,241.26,112.99,13.13">𝛿 𝑡 𝑖 ,𝑡 𝑗 = 𝐻𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑟(𝑡 𝑖 ⃗ , 𝑡 𝑗 ⃗ )</formula><p>By doing so, it is possible to find the maximal similarity distance obtained for a testimonial compared to all the others, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="4,220.11,297.72,155.05,14.19">𝛿 𝑡 𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥({𝛿 𝑡 𝑖 ,𝑡 𝑗 , . . . , 𝛿 𝑡 𝑖 ,𝑡 𝑛-1 })</formula><p>Assuming that every testimonials has to be part of the testimonial set, the maximal similarity distance obtained across the evaluation is then the minimal threshold to be part of the set, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="4,184.81,358.13,225.17,14.19">𝛿 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥({𝛿 𝑡 1 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , . . . , 𝛿 𝑡𝑛 𝑚𝑎𝑥 }) 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝛿 𝑚𝑎𝑥</formula><p>Thus, predicting if a test user pertains to the testimonial set is given by computing the similarity distance of its vector of topic probabilities against the vector of every testimonial. For a given test user, if the minimal similarity distance computed is lower than the threshold, then it is decided that the test user is part of the testimonial set.</p><p>𝛿 𝑢 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛({𝛿 𝑢,𝑡 1 , . . . , 𝛿 𝑢,𝑡𝑛 })</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="4,191.99,469.19,209.61,29.86">𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝛿 𝑢 𝑚𝑖𝑛 , 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) = {︃ 1 if 𝛿 𝑢 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≤ 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒</formula><p>One potential issue with the use of these testimonials is that their language might differ from that used in Reddit fora. Nonetheless, topic models should smooth over the particulars by grouping word co-occurrences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Questionnaire</head><p>Our second approach makes use of a self-evaluation questionnaire in addition to the set of testimonials. The self-evaluation questionnaire, which is often offered by resources for compulsive gamblers, was found on several websites, including Gamblers Anonymous Montreal<ref type="foot" coords="4,457.59,609.92,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . This one is composed of 20 questions answerable by yes or no. An individual scoring 7 or more positive answers from this questionnaire is considered at risk of a pathological gambling problem.</p><p>Comparably to the testimonial approach, we aim to find the minimal similarity distance threshold 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 to be considered at risk of pathological gambling. Here, this threshold is computed using the self-evaluation questionnaire and the testimonial set 𝑇 . Given the questionnaire 𝑞 and its vector of topic probabilities 𝑞 ⃗, a testimonial 𝑡 is said close enough to the questionnaire to be considered at risk of pathological gambling if the Hellinger distance between 𝑡 ⃗ and 𝑞 ⃗ is less or equal to the threshold 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 . Thus, the idea is to find the maximal similarity distance 𝛿 𝑞 𝑚𝑎𝑥 to define this threshold, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="5,187.05,191.00,220.69,14.19">𝛿 𝑞 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥({𝛿 𝑞,𝑡 1 , . . . , 𝛿 𝑞,𝑡𝑛 }) 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝛿 𝑞 𝑚𝑎𝑥</formula><p>Then, predicting if a test user is at risk of pathological gambling can be made using its distance from the self-evaluation questionnaire, such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="5,195.77,253.54,202.05,29.86">𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝛿 𝑢,𝑞 , 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) = {︃ 1 if 𝛿 𝑢,𝑞 ≤ 𝜃 𝑚𝑖𝑛 0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>Results obtained on the test set of Task 1 by our models and the best performing models on each metric. Runs are denoted APPROACH-stem and APPROACH-reg following the methodology adopted from <ref type="bibr" coords="5,489.67,360.23,16.32,8.87" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . The results are presented in Tables <ref type="table" coords="5,266.25,599.37,5.17,10.91">1</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="5,295.48,599.37,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. Our best model was Run 0, outperforming our other approaches on both precision and F-measure. While showing a limited precision, it obtained the best 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸 5 across every other system presented for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Task 2: Early Detection of Signs of Self-Harm</head><p>The task was introduced in 2019, and teams did not have access to any training data, producing modest results <ref type="bibr" coords="6,156.05,124.83,16.20,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The following year, Transformer-based approaches were the most prolific, achieving the best precision, 𝐹 1 -score, 𝐸𝑅𝐷𝐸s and latency-weighted 𝐹 1 . XLM-RoBERTa models were trained on texts from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="6,374.53,151.93,16.25,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and predicted whether a user was at risk of self-harm or not by averaging on all their known posts. Each of their runs targeted a specific evaluation metric for the fine-tuning. As noted by <ref type="bibr" coords="6,391.43,179.03,16.09,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, most runs had a near perfect recall and also a very low precision. Of those, NLP-UNED (runs 3 &amp; 4) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,440.16,192.57,17.97,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> seemed to gather the best overall performances. Their systems used a combination of textual features and sentiment analysis from the entire user's historic to predict whether they were at risk. The best results are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="6,222.68,233.22,3.74,10.91" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Task and Data</head><p>The task objective and evaluation process are identical to that of Task 1, including the iterative evaluation of models and the metrics. The key difference, however, is that a training set was provided. The training set counted 145 positive subjects out of 763 (19.0%), while the test set counted 152 positive out of 1448 (10.5%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Approaches</head><p>For this task, two approaches based on neural networks were tested. One is based on the Contextualizer encoder <ref type="bibr" coords="6,195.91,517.54,16.25,10.91" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, while the other is based on RoBERTa embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="6,442.46,517.54,16.25,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Contextualizer</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" coords="6,136.58,566.87,16.28,10.91" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, two modes aggregating the different writings in a subject's history were used. The first, nested aggregation, uses one Contextualizer encoder to encode the writings separately into single vector representation and another Contextualizer encoder to aggregate writings together. The second mode, flat aggregation, performs both these steps at once by providing positional information to each word about its writing and within-writing position. For both of these approaches, the positional information about writings is not the chronological order but the time difference with respect to the most recent writing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">RoBERTa embeddings</head><p>A Transformer model was trained using RoBERTa <ref type="bibr" coords="7,310.49,107.54,16.09,10.91" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This training was carried out on Reddit data by masked language modeling. This approach tokenizes writings into character n-grams based on their frequency in the source corpus. Once the Transformer was trained, the writings in the training set were transformed into token embeddings. These token embeddings constituting a writing, 𝑥 1 , . . . , 𝑥 𝑛 , are averaged together into a single document vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="7,267.32,182.37,60.14,33.71">𝑥 ¯= 1 𝑛 𝑛 ∑︁ 𝑖=1 𝑥 𝑖</formula><p>In order to combine these document representations into a single vector per subject, we posit that writings farther in the past should be given less importance than more recent ones. Given a set of 𝑚 documents, {(𝑥 ¯𝑗, 𝑡 𝑗 )} 𝑚 𝑗=1 , where 𝑡 𝑗 ∈ R denotes the difference in hours from the 𝑗-th document to the most recent one, the document vectors are aggregated into a single vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11" coords="7,259.05,287.19,76.22,33.71">𝑢 = 𝑚 ∑︁ 𝑗=1 𝛼 𝑡 𝑗 * 𝑥 ¯𝑗</formula><p>Here, 𝛼 is a vector of learned parameters and the exponentiation and multiplication, *, are applied element-wise. This allows for each feature to decay at an independent rate. Thereafter, the predicted probability of having observed a positive instance is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12" coords="7,266.48,380.96,62.31,12.06">𝑦 ^= 𝜎(𝑤 ⊤ 𝑢),</formula><p>where 𝜎 denotes the standard sigmoid function and 𝑤 is a vector of learned parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Training</head><p>All models are trained by gradient descent with a binary cross entropy minimization objective using the Adam algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="7,208.43,463.11,16.20,10.91" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. To compensate for possible discrepancies between the proportions of labels between the training and test sets, a balanced validation set was built taking half of the positive subjects and a number of negative subjects to match. In addition, a stratified validation set was also tested. In training, subjects were inversely weighted in the loss function to account for the imbalance. For both approaches, different contiguous samples of writings from each subject are taken at each epoch. The size of such samples was chosen to allow models to make early decisions without requiring a long history of writings. In validation, however, the most recent documents for each subject are taken. Model selection was based on the area under the precision-recall curve, which is equivalent to the average precision. The selected models are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,225.37,585.06,3.75,10.91" target="#tab_2">4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Task and Data</head><p>As with Tasks 1 and 2 the dataset comprises a history of writings per subject. However, instead of a binary label, each subject is associated with a set of 21 labels corresponding to the answers they gave to each item of the BDI. Furthermore, evaluation did not include a temporal aspect: the entire history of writings for the test subjects was made available at once. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="9,109.05,611.07,5.17,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the BDI scores are overall higher in the test set, with the median and median absolute deviation for the training and test set being (20.0, 9.5) and (27.0, 10.0) respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Evaluation</head><p>In order to evaluate BDI predictions against the true BDI answers associated with a set of subjects, <ref type="bibr" coords="10,89.29,358.46,17.76,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> propose four metrics. The Average Hit Rate (AHR) is the rate of exactly correct predictions averaged across the 21 items of the BDI and across subjects. In contrast, the Average Closeness Rate (ACR) measures the proximity in value ([0,3]) between the predicted and true answer when compared to the maximum possible difference (3). Similarly, the Average Difference in Overall Depression Levels (ADODL) compares the total score of the predicted BDI to the true total score, once again normalized by the maximum (63). Finally, the Depression Category Hit Rate (DCHR) is the accuracy in the depression categorization resulting from the predicted BDIs of subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Approaches</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr" coords="10,136.78,489.16,11.48,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we opt for predicting the BDI items based on the similarities of the writings of the test subjects to those of the training subjects. These similarities are computed on learned representations of the textual production of subjects. These representations were based on topic modeling or neural encoders trained on authorship decision. In addition to the categorical prediction of BDI items proposed by <ref type="bibr" coords="10,249.49,543.36,11.27,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a regression approach (Reg.) based on the values of the answers was also tested, with the values being multiplied by the relevant similarity score. There is a high variance in answers even among subjects in the same depression category. To address this in the regression approach, each training subject's answer to each question is smoothed to the average answer in their depression category by a hyperparameter, 𝛽 ∈ [0, 1],</p><formula xml:id="formula_13" coords="10,236.58,620.75,121.16,10.63">𝑎 𝑗 ← 𝛽 * 𝑎 𝑗 + (1 -𝛽) * 𝑎 ¯𝑗</formula><p>Here, 𝑎 𝑗 denotes the answer selected by the 𝑗-th training subject to a given item in the BDI and 𝑎 ¯𝑗, the average answer selected by the subjects in the depression category that said subject belongs too.</p><p>Variance aside, this approach is still potentially highly sensitive to the particular distribution of BDI scores in the training set. To address this, a nearest-neighbors approach was tested wherein a set number of neighbors was to be drawn from each of the four depression categories. This approach is denoted k'NN, and can be applied in both the regression and categorical settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Topic Modeling</head><p>Topic modeling consists in inferring probability distributions over a vocabulary of words, such that the documents, the subjects' histories in our case, constitute a mixture of such distributions. As a baseline, we selected the well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. Further, another topic model, operating on word embeddings rather than symbolic word representations like LDA, ETM <ref type="bibr" coords="11,157.56,244.69,11.30,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, was also tested. Models were trained on a depression-detection dataset also issuing from Reddit <ref type="bibr" coords="11,176.49,258.24,16.09,10.91" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This training was carried out considering the entire history of writings from each subject as a single document. For the LDA approach, two tokenization schemes were tested: character trigrams and word stems. In contrast, only stemming was tested for the ETM model for interpretability purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Authorship decision</head><p>Deep Averaging Networks (DANs) were trained to discern whether two sets of writings were authored by the same person. This can induce a representation relevant to depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" coords="11,115.05,375.31,11.58,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As with topics models, these models were trained on the eRisk 2018 Depression dataset, using alternately character trigrams and word stems. The training procedure consists in sampling non-overlapping sets of writings from subjects and pairing them together. Pairs of samples issuing from the same subject constitute positive examples and pairs issuing from different subjects, negative ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Model selection</head><p>As previously mentioned, this approach is potentially highly sensitive to the distribution of BDI scores in the training set. In order to mitigate this, the validation set selected contained 24 subjects equally divided among the four depression categories defined by the BDI. The hyper-parameter values tested were borrowed from <ref type="bibr" coords="11,322.00,519.48,11.43,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Models were selected based on the performance on all four metrics. Indeed, selecting the top performers for each metric separately might exclude models performing well overall. However, in order to combine all four metrics into a single quantity by which to select models requires consideration. Although the metrics are valued in the unit interval, they have different scales in practice. Therefore, combining the performance for each metric for all models and hyperparameter values, the z-score for each one was computed. Then, the average z-score across all metrics was used to select the models. The selected models are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,444.93,614.33,3.77,10.91" target="#tab_6">9</ref>. As in <ref type="bibr" coords="11,481.90,614.33,11.50,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, 𝑘 denotes the number of neighbors considered, while 𝛿 is the consensus parameter of DMkNN. 𝐷 and 𝑡 denote the size of the writing history partition and the number of parcel pairs considered. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results</head><p>The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="12,231.32,385.84,8.53,10.91" target="#tab_7">10</ref>. Our best model was Run 2, outperforming the rest of our models on each metric. Overall, the total BDI scores predicted were low, with Run 0 having the highest median of 18 and Run 3 having the lowest of 8. Predictions were quite tight within each run, with Run 1 having the highest median absolute deviation of 6. Furthermore predictions were consistent among runs, with Run 1 and 4 agreeing the least, on only 44% of answers globally. Interestingly, although Run 0 agreed the most with Run 2 (64%), it achieved much weaker results, especially in terms of DCHR. Overall, the approach remains sensitive to the particulars of the training set where neighbors are sourced. This is perhaps due to text alone not eliciting, by unsupervised learning alone, similarity that pertains to depression symptoms. Future work could include integrating manual annotation or prior knowledge in the training of the similarity models, authorship and topic alike. Moreover, in order for the overall approach to be effective in the 21-way prediction at hand, similarity could be handled separately by component or groups of components of the subject representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>RELAI participated in all three eRisk 2021 shared tasks. Task 1, Early Detection of the Signs of Pathological Gambling, proved an interesting challenge in the lack of training data. Nonetheless, the use of testimonials and self-assessment questionnaires constitutes a promising avenue in such a context. The Early Detection of the Signs of Self-Harm, Task 2, was a more conventional one. The favoring of early decisions resulted in high recall but poor precision overall. Nonetheless, some of the proposed approaches produced good ranking-based results. Finally, Task 3, Measuring the Severity of the Signs of Depression, remains thoroughly difficult. However, in predicting BDI scores based on similarity, restricting the number of neighbors per depression category proved an interesting option to address uncertain distributions of BDI scores.</p><p>The source code of the proposed systems is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.
