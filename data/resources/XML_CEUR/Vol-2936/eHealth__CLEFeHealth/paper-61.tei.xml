<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and Motivation</head><p>In the last years, the volume of digitally available information of the medical domain has been in constant growth. This is due especially to the widespread adoption of clinical information systems and electronic health records (EHRs). Consequently, this is leading to the progressive adoption of natural language processing applications in healthcare because of its recognized potential to search, analyze and interpret patient datasets. Physicians spend a lot of time inputting patients data into EHR systems, most of it stored as narratives of free text. The extraction of information contained in these texts is useful for many purposes from which some of the most relevant are: diagnostic surveillance through automated detection of critical observations; query based case retrieval; quality assessment of radiologic practice; automatic content analysis of report databases; and clinical support services integrated in the clinical workflow <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.28,246.77,11.43,10.91" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>There are many types of medical reports within an electronic health record, such as chart notes, case notes, progress notes, radiology reports and discharge reports. Some of them are written in highly specialized and local vocabulary and in the special case of radiology reports, they may have non-standard abbreviations, typos and ill-formed sentences. Because of the particularities of the medical domain, clinical corpora are difficult to obtain. Clinical records are of sensitive nature, so they are usually not published, and, if done so, they have to be anonymized. Moreover, the highly specialized and local vocabulary makes the annotation a difficult and expensive task.</p><p>Most of the currently available resources on clinical report processing are for English. For Spanish, the availability of resources is much more limited, despite being one of the languages with more native speakers in the world. In particular, there are very few available annotated corpora (see <ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.45,409.36,42.60,10.91">Section 2)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, we publish a novel corpus through the organization of the SpRadIE challenge, a task proposed in the context of the CLEF eHealth 2021 evaluation lab <ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.26,436.46,12.97,10.91" target="#b1">[2]</ref> 1 . This corpus is a reviewed version of a previously annotated and anonymized corpus of Spanish radiology reports <ref type="bibr" coords="2,89.29,463.56,11.33,10.91" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,103.36,463.56,7.55,10.91" target="#b3">4]</ref>. With SpRadIE we intend to collaborate to the advancement in the automatic processing of medical texts in Spanish, while offering participants the opportunity to submit novel systems and compare their results using the same dataset and a standard evaluation framework. To our knowledge, SpRadIE is the first information extraction challenge on Spanish radiology reports.</p><p>More concretely, the SpRadIE challenge dataset consists of a corpus of pediatric ultrasound reports from an Argentinian public hospital. These reports are generally written within a hospital information system by direct typing into a computer a single section of plain text, where the most relevant findings are described. The reports are written using standard boilerplate that guide physicians on the structuring when there are no anomalous findings. However, most of the times they are written in free text to be able to describe the findings discovered in anomalous studies. The fact that input is free text and that anomalies are often found and reported results in great variations in the content of the reports and in their size, ranging from 8 to 193 words.</p><p>SpRadIE offers multiple challenges that need to be addressed with creative solutions:</p><p>Low resources: The availability of linguistic resources in Spanish is greatly limited in com-1 https://sites.google.com/view/spradie-2020/ parison to high-resource languages such as English. In particular, there are no specific terminologies for the radiology domain in Spanish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain-specific language:</head><p>The vocabulary used in radiology reports is specific to the radiology domain. The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) produced Radlex (Radiology Lexicon) <ref type="foot" coords="3,205.58,147.63,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_0">2</ref> an extensive, dedicated and comprehensive set of radiology terms in English, for use in radiology reporting, decision support, data mining, data registries, education and research. Besides, SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms) <ref type="foot" coords="3,183.28,188.28,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_1">3</ref> is considered to be the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology (it includes Spanish) for medicine and has mappings to Radlex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ill-formed texts:</head><p>Reports usually present ill-formed sentences, misspellings, inconsistencies in the usage of abbreviations, and lack of punctuation and line breaks, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,147.63,252.46,3.74,10.91">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic Split:</head><p>Training, development and test sets cover different semantic fields, so that various topics and their corresponding entities that occur in the test dataset have not been previously seen in the training dataset.</p><p>Small data: To approach realistic deployment conditions, only a small amount of annotated reports has been available during training, and the rest has been used for evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complex entities:</head><p>The linguistic form of entities presents some particular difficulties: lengthier entities with inner structure, embedded entities and discontinuities. Examples can be found in Section 3.</p><p>In the past, some challenges have been organized for information extraction in the medical domain in Spanish (see Section 2). However, our proposal covers a part of the domain spectrum that was not covered by previous work: actual short reports written in haste with mistakes and variability.</p><p>In this article we present the SpRadIE challenge and its results. The challenge aims at the detection of seven different named entities as well as hedge cues from ultrasounds reports. Targeted entities include anatomical entities and findings that describe a pathological or anomalous event. Also negations and indicators of probability or future outcomes are to be detected. We provide training, development and test datasets, and evaluate the participating systems using metrics based on lenient and exact match.</p><p>Overall seven different teams participated in the task, with participants from Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and Colombia. In more than 70% of them, there is at least one Spanish native speaker. Most teams experimented with different variations of neural networks, particularly BERT-based approaches. However, there were also submissions based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and pattern rules. The presence of overlapping and discontinuous entities was one of the biggest challenges of the task. In order to overcome this problem, several teams developed multiple classifiers running in parallel, together with pre and post-processing steps for the input/output of the classifiers.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the following Section we present previous work for Spanish medical information extraction and Spanish corpora in the medical domain. In Section 3 we describe the target of the annotation, detailing types of entities, their distribution in the annotated dataset, some of their most prominent features and the difficulty of the task as measured by human inter-annotator agreement. Then, Section 4 presents the Evaluation setting. Participating systems and baselines are described in Section 5, while results are discussed in Section 6. We finish with some conclusions and a hope for the advancement in the automatic treatment of medical text in Spanish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Previous work</head><p>In clinical care, many important patient related information is stored in textual format, supplementing the structured information of electronic health records. To automatically access and make use of this valuable information, methods of natural language processing (NLP), like named entity recognition, relation extraction and negation detection, can be applied. In order to train such methods, domain-related corpora have to be available. Medicine has many sub-domains, such as radiology. The availability of specific corpora for handling them is of utmost importance for the advancement of the BioNLP area.</p><p>Given the sensitive nature of medical data and the difficulty of its annotation process, only very few corpora are available, and most of them are in English (e.g., CheXpert <ref type="bibr" coords="4,438.48,348.83,12.73,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" coords="4,112.70,362.38,11.10,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Moreover, most existing tools to process clinical text are also developed for English. Nevertheless, in recent years the interest and need for processing non-English clinical text has been increasing. In particular for Spanish, one of the languages with more native speakers in the world.</p><p>Annotation of medical texts is a difficult task, particularly for clinical records. Wilbur et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,493.31,416.58,12.68,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> defined annotation guidelines to categorize segments of scientific sentences in research articles of the biomedical domain. The first published guideline for the annotation of radiology reports that we are aware of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,186.96,457.22,12.99,10.91" target="#b2">[3]</ref> has been reviewed and enhanced for the annotation of the dataset provided in this challenge. Besides, there are some corpora of negations in Spanish clinical reports <ref type="bibr" coords="4,125.12,484.32,11.49,10.91" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,139.96,484.32,7.65,10.91" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Finally, recently, PadChest, a corpora of 27,593 Spanish annotated radiology reports has been published <ref type="bibr" coords="4,211.65,497.87,16.25,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In the past, several challenges have been organized for information extraction in the medical domain in Spanish. The CodiEsp shared task in CLEF-2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,348.97,524.97,17.77,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> addressed clinical cases (longer sentences and paragrahps, more consistent use of vocabulary and less typos than radiology reports). The target of CodiEsp was to assign tags at a document level, and to identify text spans that support the assignation of the tags. The eHealth-KD challenge <ref type="foot" coords="4,406.62,563.86,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">4</ref> and the CANTEMIST shared task , <ref type="foot" coords="4,145.77,577.41,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_3">5</ref> both part of IberLEF-SEPLN 2020, targeted the identification of named entities and relations (at different levels of granularity in the types of entities) but in medical research papers instead of clinical reports. Other challenges that targeted information extraction from Spanish biomedical texts were PharmaCoNER <ref type="bibr" coords="4,301.56,619.81,18.07,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (detection of drug and chemical entities) MEDDOCAN <ref type="bibr" coords="4,150.73,633.36,17.76,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (anonymization), TASS eHealth-KD 2018 Task 3 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,379.28,633.36,17.75,10.91" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and IberLEF eHealth-KD 2019 and 2020 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,154.47,86.97,16.43,10.91" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,173.63,86.97,12.32,10.91" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>Spanish negation detection in the biomedical domain is also a current subject of interest (see NEGES 2018 Workshop on Negation in Spanish) <ref type="foot" coords="5,301.09,112.31,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_4">6</ref> , that has some works for the medical domain and <ref type="bibr" coords="5,108.44,127.61,16.43,10.91" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,127.59,127.61,12.55,10.91" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,142.87,127.61,12.55,10.91" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,158.14,127.61,12.55,10.91" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,173.41,127.61,12.32,10.91" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Besides the approaches used in previously mentioned challenges, not much work has been done for NER in Spanish clinical reports so far. Focusing in the radiology domain, only a few publications target NER in the context of Spanish radiology reports <ref type="bibr" coords="5,385.91,168.26,16.30,10.91" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,404.92,168.26,12.23,10.91" target="#b22">23]</ref>. General overviews about NLP in radiology can be seen in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,261.74,181.81,11.36,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,275.83,181.81,12.32,10.91" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Target of the challenge</head><p>The target of the task is Named Entity Recognition and Classification. As mentioned above, these entities present several challenges. We describe the types of entities we are targeting and then exemplify some of the challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Classes of entities</head><p>Seven different classes of concepts in the radiology domain are distinguished. Since these entities refer to very precise, complex concepts, they are realized by correspondingly complex textual forms. Entities may be very long, sometimes even spanning over sentence boundaries, embedded within other entities of different types and may be discontinuous. Moreover, different text strings may be used to refer to the same entity, including abbreviations and typos.</p><p>Entities are formed by a word or a sequence of words, not necessarily continuous, and entities can be embedded within other entities. The following entities are distinguished: Anatomical Entity, Finding, Location, Measure, Type of Measure, Degree, and Abbreviation. Hedge cues are also identified, distinguishing: Negation, Uncertainty, and Conditional-Temporal. Examples can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,167.77,439.20,3.74,10.91" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned before, these entities present several challenges. Examples of longer, discontinuous and overlapping entities can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,326.77,466.30,3.74,10.91">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Annotated dataset</head><p>The data consists of 513 ultrasonography reports provided by a public pediatric hospital in Argentina.

The most frequent type, Anatomical Entity, has more than 2,000 occurrences, and there are almost 1,500 Findings, but there are only 163 hedges, and only 15 Conditional-Temporal hedges. It can be expected that performance of automatic systems is poor in types of entities with such few examples.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,120.52,487.58,3.82,8.93">3</ref>: A sample report, with its translation to English. It shows abbreviations ("RD" for right kidney, "RI" for left kidney, "Diam" for diameter), typos ("formsa" for "forma"), and inconsistencies (capitalization of "Vejiga" because of start of sentence without a full stop.)</p><p>Moreover, the different types of entities differ a lot among themselves. While entities of the Finding type have an average length of 2.35 words and Anatomical Entities are in average 1.9 words long, which is not a big difference. However, we can see a big difference in the number of times words are repeated within each type of entity. In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,377.24,589.74,5.04,10.91" target="#fig_4">6</ref> we can see that most of the words in Type of Measure and Negation occur at least 10 times, as is shown by the long box, meaning that the majority of words occur up to 10 times or even more. With quite a tall box, we can see that words in Anatomical Entities also tend to occur a high number of times. In contrast, most of the words in Findings or Locations occur less than 2 or 3 times. If entities are more repetitive in their wording, it is easier for an automatic classifier to identify them.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Inter-annotator Agreement</head><p>Automatic classifiers will be expected to perform well in those cases where human annotators have strong agreement, and worse in cases that are difficult for human annotators to identify consistently.</p><p>We carried out a small study of inter-annotator agreement to assess the difficulty of the task for trained human experts. Three trained linguists independently annotated 20 reports (totalling 2,000 words and over 1,700 annotated entities) after reading the annotation guidelines and sharing the annotations for two reports. The mean inter-annotator agreement was 𝜅 = .85.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="8,143.46,640.97,5.11,10.91" target="#fig_5">7</ref> it can be seen that, among the frequent entities, Location is the one with lowest agreement and variation in agreement. Degree also has low agreement, and the Uncertainty hedge. No figures for Conditional-Temporal were obtained because there were few cases in the dataset.</p><p>Thus, it can be expected that automatic classifiers perform worse in these categories than in other that are more easily identified by humans, like Abbreviation, Anatomical Entity of Finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Evaluation setting 4.1. Dataset Partitions</head><p>Since reports are highly repetitive, almost half of the annotated corpus (207 reports) was used as test set for evaluation. The test set was created by identifying terms belonging to a given semantic field within the reports, and selecting all reports containing those terms. Thus, the test set was guaranteed to contain words not in the training corpus, which was useful to assess  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Metrics</head><p>Submissions were evaluated using precision, recall and F1 scores, using both an exact and a lenient matching scheme. Metrics were computed separately for each entity type. Therefore, no credit is given for predictions with correct span but incorrect type. Global results were obtained by micro-averaging. This way, the influence of each entity type in the global results is proportional to its frequency in the test corpus.</p><p>We believe that small variations in the span of named entities do not severely affect the quality of the results. Minor differences in the spans still provide useful information for possible applications. Lenient matching can be used to give credit to partial matches in named entities.</p><p>For this challenge, we used as the main metric a micro-averaged F1 based on lenient match. We also computed scores based on exact match as secondary metrics.</p><p>The lenient scores are calculated using the Jaccard index and based on the metrics used in the Bacteria Biotope task of BioNLP 2013 <ref type="bibr" coords="11,270.28,127.61,16.09,10.91" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The Jaccard index is used as a similarity measure between a reference and a predicted entity. It is defined as the ratio of intersection over union as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="11,144.72,175.15,304.63,24.43">𝐽(𝑟𝑒𝑓, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑) = 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝(𝑟𝑒𝑓, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑) 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑟𝑒𝑓 ) + 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑) -𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝(𝑟𝑒𝑓, 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑)</formula><p>where 𝑟𝑒𝑓 represents the reference string of the gold standard and 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 the corresponding string which was predicted. Both, overlap and length are measured in characters. An exact match has a value of 1.</p><p>To compute the lenient metrics, we first match reference and predicted entities pairwise. The Jaccard index is used as the point-wise similarity to be optimized in the matching process. To guarantee a global optimal matching in the general case, a bipartite graph matching algorithm would be required. Instead, for simplicity, we implemented a greedy matching algorithm that iterates over the ordered predicted entities and chooses the best matching reference entity. This approach was tested using hand-crafted test cases specifically designed for complex situations, and it always gave the expected matchings.</p><p>The matching process returns a set 𝑀 of matching pairs of reference and predicted entities. Then, lenient precision and recall are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="11,196.60,392.45,72.08,10.77">𝑃 𝑅𝐸𝐶 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 =</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Baselines</head><p>Two baselines were constructed: an instance-based learner based on string matching and an off-the-shelf neural learner.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the annotated entities in SpRadIE dataset are very repetitive. For this reason, the first simple baseline is an instance-based learner that relies on a simple string matching approach. For each entity in the training set, we extract the different annotated strings with a minimum length of two characters. Whenever a match is found in the test set, it is classified just as it had been seen during training.</p><p>A second baseline system uses the Flair framework <ref type="bibr" coords="12,336.98,597.37,16.42,10.91" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Very limited effort was put into pre-and post-processing. Only spans of text tagged with overlapping entities were simplified to a single entity, the most frequent one. The data was fed to a neural sequence tagger with 256 hidden layers and 0.3 locked dropout probability, including a CRF decoder appended at the end. The model also utilizes a stack of Spanish fastText embeddings as well as contextual string embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="12,145.36,665.11,16.22,10.91" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The model trained for a maximum of 20 epochs with a mini-batch size of 40, resulting in a 1,5 GB NER model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Analysis of Results</head><p>In this section we present the results obtained by the seven teams in the task, together with the baselines. Each team could submit up to four runs, however we just report the results of the best performing run of each team in Table <ref type="table" coords="13,301.69,409.77,3.81,10.91" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Details for the rest of the runs can be seen in the individual papers for each learner. Best scores for lenient precision, recall and F1 are highlighted in bold. Table <ref type="table" coords="13,211.18,436.87,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the detail of performance for the 5 most frequent entity types, which cover more than 80% of all entity mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baselines</head><p>The string matching baseline provides a reference for a very naïve approach to the task, without any kind of generalization. The Flair baseline is a reference of the performance that can be obtained with a more sophisticated learning architecture but without putting effort into optimization, pre-or post-processing. This second baseline already shows that for our problem machine learning quickly outperforms the simple string match approach. While resulting in a similar recall, the precision of the machine learning approach clearly improves.</p><p>Participating Teams Overall, EdIE achieved the best results in the challenge, for both lenient and exact F1 score and recall. EdIE achieves the best results for all five most frequent entity types. However, its performance is worse for less frequent concepts, such as Degree (54%), Uncertainty (34%) or ContionalTemporal (0%). The overall outcome of LSI is very close to EdIE in terms of F1, particularly for exact match. In contrast to EdIE, LSI achieves a higher precision. Overall results are solid across entity types. Similarly to EdIE, LSI has problems dealing with ContionalTemporal, with a performance of 0%. In contrast, CTB, the third ranked system, performs particularly well for ContionalTemporal (67%), as well as for Anatomical Entities and Location. For the rest of concepts, results tend to be about 5-10 points below the best system.</p><p>HULAT, opposed to the other three systems, uses a CRF instead of a neural architecture. It achieves very similar results regarding lenient F1 in comparison to CTB, but has a drop in exact F1. Overall the system performs quite well regarding Location, Finding, Negation, Uncertainty and ContionalTemporal. In case of Measure, the system has a strong drop of performance in comparison to the best system. More focus on this concept, would have certainly boosted the performance further.</p><p>The SINAI team, while fifth in overall performance, achieved highest scoring results for two of the most challenging entity types, namely, Finding and Location. Location was one of the concepts where human annotators showed less consistency. Conversely, the system has got a strong drop in performance regarding Abbreviations -about 70 points in comparison to the lenient F1 of the best system. This might have strongly influenced the overall performance of the system, as abbreviations occurs very frequently.</p><p>SWAP achieved mostly fair performance for all concepts. It performs well above the string matching baseline and better than the Flair baseline for exact match. IMS provides a simple pattern based approach, similar to our string matching baseline. It shows how such a simple approach can easily obtain a lenient recall around 60%, which may be useful for applications like information retrieval.</p><p>Performance across entity types It can be seen that the performance across entity types has some correlation with repetitiveness of strings within entities of a given type and with the consistency of human annotators.</p><p>Indeed, entities where annotators were less consistent, mainly Location (see Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,463.02,609.55,3.50,10.91" target="#fig_5">7</ref>), overall performance was lower, with a drop of more than 10% with respect to overall performance in most cases, and 15% in the best performing systems. We believe this may be due to these entities having a less defined reference than others, like Anatomical Entities.</p><p>The other major entity type with lower performance is Finding. In this case, we believe less defined semantics may be a cause for difficulty, but also the form of these entities itself; as described in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="15,190.42,100.52,3.80,10.91" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, words in Findings occur much less frequently than in other kinds of entities.</p><p>Discussion Participating systems can be differentiated in three coarse groups with respect to performance. The first group, consisting of the first two teams, both provide quite similar results and have got some distance to the group in the middle field, consisting of the next three teams. The remaining two teams show lower performance. While IMS describes an easy and quick system to start with, and achieves therefore baseline performance, SWAP might have chosen an inadequate architecture for the task. The authors finally submitted a run with XLM-RoBERTa, although other systems performed better during development of their system. However, while multilingual BERT performed best, BETO might have been a better option, as it is solely trained on Spanish language data. With respect to best performing systems, what seems to have the biggest impact in performance is an architecture based on multiple classifiers, instead of a single multiclass model. The only exception to this would be CTB, scoring third with a multiclass model. This seems to be related to the phenomenon of overlapping entities, which is pervasive in the dataset.</p><p>Pre-and post-processing also made slight differences in performance, but less than differences in the architecture of learners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented the results of the SpRadIE challenge for detection and classification of named entities and hedge cues in radiology reports in Spanish.</p><p>Seven teams participated in the challenge, achieving good performance, with results well above baselines. Although challenging entity types, like Finding, Location or hedge cues like Conditional-Temporal barely reach 74% F1, Anatomical Entities, Measure or Abbreviation can be recognized at almost 90% F1. This shows promising performance for integration within productive workflows.</p><p>Among the different approaches to the problem, we have found that combinations of multiple classifiers clearly outperform single multiclass models. Neural approaches specifically trained for Spanish also tend to perform better than generic or multilingual approaches. Also pre-and post-processing have a positive impact in performance.</p><p>Although Spanish has hundreds of millions of native speakers worldwide, not much work has been done in information extraction from Spanish medical reports. It is important to note that at least five of the seven participating teams have at least a Spanish native speaker. With this challenge, we provided a standard evaluation framework for a domain of Spanish medical text processing, namely radiology reports, that had not been previously addressed in this kind of effort.</p><p>We hope that this challenge and the promising results obtained by participating systems encourage other institutions to make resources publicly available, and thus contribute to the advancement in the automatic processing of medical texts, specially in Spanish.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="6,223.34,202.74,21.84,6.21;6,199.98,213.00,4.48,6.38;6,234.26,213.00,4.48,6.38;6,202.96,219.39,62.58,8.80;6,131.92,233.70,127.95,8.96;6,102.14,248.17,189.04,9.77;6,101.87,260.80,187.77,8.87;6,102.14,272.75,187.51,8.87;6,102.14,284.71,189.04,8.87;6,102.14,296.66,173.94,8.87;6,143.44,322.05,42.99,8.80;6,206.60,306.15,24.90,6.21;6,189.75,315.66,4.48,6.38;6,219.05,315.66,4.48,6.38;6,192.74,322.05,52.62,8.80;6,153.39,336.36,85.01,8.96;6,102.14,350.83,145.94,9.77;6,125.45,378.91,98.93,8.80;6,233.81,363.49,24.78,6.21;6,228.82,372.99,21.86,6.38;6,231.81,378.91,34.53,8.80;6,136.02,392.07,119.76,8.96;6,102.14,406.54,187.51,9.77;6,102.14,419.17,68.04,8.87;6,152.65,431.50,47.75,6.21;6,125.45,441.76,4.48,6.38;6,176.53,441.76,4.48,6.38;6,128.44,448.15,137.89,8.80"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>detected Location It refers to a location in the body.
