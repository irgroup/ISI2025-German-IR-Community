<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>CLEF 2021 eHealth Consumer Health Search (CHS) task is a continuation of the previous CLEF eHealth information retrieval (IR) tasks that started in 2013 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,346.61,372.56,11.23,10.91" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,360.10,372.56,7.42,10.91" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,369.79,372.56,7.49,10.91" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The consumer health search task follows a standard IR shared challenge paradigm from the perspective that it provides a test collection consisting of a set of documents and a set of topics. Participants must retrieve web pages that fulfill a given patient's personalized information need. This needs to fulfill the following criteria: information credibility, quality, and suitability. The 2021 eHealth IR Task includes 3 sub-tasks: ad-hoc information retrieval, weakly supervised information retrieval, and document credibility prediction <ref type="bibr" coords="1,232.73,453.86,11.43,10.91" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>This paper describes the Zhongyuan University of Technology (ZUT) approach to CLEF 2021 eHealth IR task Subtask 1. The purpose of Subtask 1 is centered on realistic use cases, and to evaluate IR systems abilities to provide users with relevant, understandable, and credible documents. In this paper, we mainly aim to investigate how a model learned on data from the previous CLEF eHealth IR task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,226.31,521.60,12.72,10.91" target="#b4">[5]</ref> performs on this year's new data collection and a new set of queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>In the information retrieval area, machine learning techniques can be applied to build ranking models for the information retrieval systems, and this is known as Learning to Rank (LTR) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,492.49,606.68,11.38,10.91" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>CLEF 2021 -Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, September 21-24, 2021, Bucharest, Romania huayangchn@gmail.com (H. Yang); ming616@zut.edu.cn (X. Liu); luckzbb@hotmail.com (B. Zheng); yangguan@zut.edu.cn (G. Yang) Typically, the training data consists of three elements: training queries Q, the associated documents D, and the corresponding relevance judgments or the gold standard qrel file for the query and document pairs. The learning algorithms are then used to generate a learning to rank model. The creation of testing data for evaluation is very similar to the creation of the training data which includes the testing queries and the associated documents. To these testing queries, the learning to rank model is jointly used with a retrieval model and to sort the documents according to their relevance to the query, and return a corresponding ranked list of the documents as the response to the query.</p><p>Learning to rank methods has been proposed based on different machine learning algorithms. Typically, existing learning to rank can be categorized into three main groups: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches. The pointwise approaches, for example, MART <ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.76,334.51,12.99,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Random Forests <ref type="bibr" coords="2,166.91,348.06,11.58,10.91" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, regard the relevance degrees as numerical or ordinal scores, and the learning to rank problem is formulated as a regression or a classification problem. The pairwise approaches, for example, RankBoost <ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.89,375.16,11.58,10.91" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, LambdaMART <ref type="bibr" coords="2,351.75,375.16,16.41,10.91" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and RankNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.64,375.16,18.07,10.91" target="#b10">[11]</ref> deal with the ranking problem by treating documents pairs as training instances, and trains models via the minimization of related risks. The listwise approaches, for example, ListNet <ref type="bibr" coords="2,468.39,402.26,18.07,10.91" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and AdaRank <ref type="bibr" coords="2,133.40,415.81,16.41,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, regard an entire set of documents associated with a query as instances in the training, and trains a ranking function through the minimization of a listwise loss function. Table <ref type="table" coords="2,115.79,442.91,5.07,10.91" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes a number of the widely used algorithms according to each LTR approach.</p><p>In this paper, the dataset and the assessment results from the 2018 CLEF eHealth IR task are used for training the learning to rank models. A number of retrieval features are explored.</p></div>

These queries are extracted and manually selected from Google trends to best fit each use case. The patients-topics set includes 30 topics which are based on discussions with multiple sclerosis and diabetes patients. These queries are manually generated by experts from established search scenarios.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Experiments</head><p>Using the data from the CLEF 2018 ehealth IR task, we totally train eight learning to rank models. The loss function used to train the learning to rank model is NDCG@10. We choose the best four performed LTR models and use them in this year's task.

The best result was obtained by the model m_rf which used Random Forests learning to rank algorithm, then followed by the model r_rb with RankBoost algorithm and the model m_lm with LambdaMART algorithm. On average, the model m_mr with MART algorithm achieved the worst result, although it showed somewhat better results in MAP and two cRBP measures when compared to the model m_lm.</p><p>Then we compare the best model m_rf with the baselines. When compared in MAP, this model was able to surpass all baselines. In Bpref, the model showed better results than the DirichletLM_qe baseline, but failed with other baselines. In the rRBP measures, the model showed better results than the two DirichletLM baselines. In the cRBP and the RBP measures, the model surpassed the baseline BM25 and the two DirichletLM baselines.</p></div>
