<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The automatic classification of snake species based on non-standardized photographs is important to improve the care of patients suffering from snake bites. The SnakeCLEF 2021 challenge, provides a large database containing images and their recording location of 772 snake species to overcome this problem. This paper describes the participation of the FHDO Biomedical Computer Science Group (BCSG) in this challenge. In the experiments, deep learning-based EfficientNets and Vision Transformer (ViT) models were trained. In a subsequent step, the prior probabilities of the location information were multiplied with the model predictions. An ensemble of both deep learning models achieved the best results, which was a macro averaging 𝐹1-score across countries of 82.88 % for the independent test set.</p></div>

Additionally, snake species identification Further studies performed deep learning-based classification tasks. For example, one approach <ref type="bibr" coords="3,121.15,100.52,17.76,10.91" target="#b12">[13]</ref> compared the accuracies of three different classification networks namely VGG16 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,490.03,100.52,16.09,10.91" target="#b20">[19]</ref>, DenseNet161 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,152.13,114.06,18.06,10.91" target="#b21">[20]</ref> and MobileNetV2 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,255.76,114.06,16.41,10.91" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. The dataset contained 3,050 images containing 28 species. The GrabCut <ref type="bibr" coords="3,187.11,127.61,17.88,10.91" target="#b24">[22]</ref> algorithm was applied as a preprocessing step to extract the snakes from the image background.

In particular, the workflow was extended to use Vision Transformer (ViT) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,420.68,371.50,17.93,10.91" target="#b33">[30]</ref> models and an ensemble of ViTs and EfficientNets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dataset</head><p>The training dataset of the SnakeCLEF 2021 and AICrowd Snake Species Identification Challenge round 5 consists of 386,006 photographs of 772 snake species. Those photographs were taken in 188 countries. The photographs originated from three different data sources, two online biodiversity platforms, namely iNaturalist 6 (n=277,025 images; 71.77 %), and Herpmapper 7 (n=58,351 images; 15.12 %) and another source containing noisy data downloaded from Flickr 8 (n=50,630 images; 13.12 %). The entire dataset was split into a training set containing 347,405 photographs (90.00 %), and a validation set containing 38,601 subjects (10.00 %). The class distribution of the united training and validation set is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,416.20,538.52,3.66,10.91" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It can be seen that the dataset was highly imbalanced. Both subsets followed similar class distributions and each class was represented in both datasets. The test dataset consists of 23,673 images. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Metadata</head><p>In addition to the photographs, metadata that provides information about the continent and country of the image location were available. Most images (n=246,482; 63.85 %) were recorded in the United States of America. For 50,879 (13.18 %) images, no country information was provided and 51,061 images (13.23 %), had no continent information. Those images were marked with the "unknown" flag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methods</head><p>The ML workflow used to learn the differences between snake species is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,500.24,472.69,3.71,10.91" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This ML workflow was implemented in a modular way, thus, during the challenge different combinations of workflow parts and their interactions were investigated. The entire workflow was implemented using the programming language Python v3.6.9 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,384.20,513.34,16.25,10.91" target="#b34">[31]</ref>.</p><p>The preprocessing stage starts with optional filtering of the dataset. Afterwards, optional OD was implemented, which was trained to detect single snakes in the photographs. Due to time constraints, no models using the OD could be submitted during the challenge. The OD stage was followed by an image preprocessing stage which produced images of uniform, quadratic size. Afterwards, data augmentation was used to make the subsequent deep learning models more robust, for example, against rotation, scaling, and noise. EfficientNets and ViTs were trained to distinguish between the snake species. Finally, optional multiplication of the models' prediction probabilities and the a priori probability distribution of the snake species given the location was implemented. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Dataset Filtering</head><p>An analysis of the dataset with AntiDupl<ref type="foot" coords="5,272.32,387.56,3.71,7.97" target="#foot_2">9</ref> revealed 29 "Image not found" images, which were the result of download problems.</p><p>Another problem that has been found are out-of-class images appearing in the Flickr dataset. These images contain no snakes but for example, ice-hockey players, churches, other animals, persons, and mangas. To identify them for exclusion from the training set, a standard ImageNet classifier with 1,000 classes and based on a ResNet50 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,320.16,457.06,17.75,10.91" target="#b18">[18]</ref> architecture has been used. Therefore, a positive list of 46 snake and reptile classes (e.g., garter_snake, sidewinder, . . . ) that are part of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSRVC2012) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,452.32,484.16,18.06,10.91" target="#b35">[32]</ref> dataset has been used. With this classifier, 6,110 out-of-class images (10.47 %) have been identified as out-of-class images in the Flickr dataset. The excluded images were assigned to 384 species. The filtered dataset contained images of all 772 snake species. The least frequent species after the filtering were "bolyeria multocarinata" and "echinanthera melanostigma", both containing one image. The out-of-class images were manually checked and a large proportion of the identified images visualize no snakes. Due to reasons of time limitations during the competition, the out-of-class images were not formally validated. The effects of the reduced dataset have been tested and compared to the unfiltered dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Object Detection</head><p>The aim of using OD as a preprocessing step to improve image classification was, to focus the subsequently implemented classification models on the object that should be classified. The idea of using OD for the identification of snake species in photographs before executing the image classification was inspired by the winning team <ref type="bibr" coords="6,336.15,148.18,18.00,10.91" target="#b36">[33]</ref> of round 2 of the AICrowd Snake Species Identification Challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="6,238.67,161.73,16.42,10.91" target="#b27">[25]</ref>. The OD used in this paper was already implemented and described in the contribution of the FHDO BCSG in the SnakeCLEF 2020 challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="6,480.30,175.28,11.46,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A Mask R-CNN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,150.61,188.83,17.84,10.91" target="#b30">[28]</ref> model was trained to identify snakes in non-standardized photographs. The Mask R-CNN implements instance segmentation, which is a combination of OD and semantic segmentation. Thus, in each image, bounding boxes are identified and classified for each object of interest and each pixel of those bounding boxes was segmented into a range of given classes. Mask R-CNN is an extension of the OD method Faster R-CNN. The Mask R-CNN architecture consists of two phases, in the first phase, identically to Faster R-CNN, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) was implemented to identify candidate bounding boxes followed by a non-maximum suppression <ref type="bibr" coords="6,146.85,283.68,18.06,10.91" target="#b37">[34]</ref> to focus on the most promising candidates. The second stage first used a Region Of Interest (ROI) Align Network on the remaining candidate bounding boxes followed by a parallel implementation of Fully Connected Networks (FCN) to identify the object class and the offset of the bounding boxes as well as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the semantic segmentation task.</p><p>In this research, the Mask R-CNN was only used as an OD framework to differentiate between snakes and background and did not use the whole instance segmentation pipeline. Due to this reason, it may be an adequate alternative to use Faster R-CNN instead of the Mask R-CNN. The comparison of both models in the TensorFlow OD Application Programming Interface (API) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,488.22,392.07,17.76,10.91" target="#b38">[35]</ref> for the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="6,362.43,405.62,17.76,10.91" target="#b39">[36]</ref> shows an increased mAP for the Mask R-CNN model. ResNet-50 was used as the backbone network and was pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset. Based on this model, the OD training process was split into two phases. In the first warm-up phase, the newly added layers were trained for 20 epochs. Afterwards, the weights of the entire model were fine-tuned for another 30 epochs.</p><p>An adaption<ref type="foot" coords="6,155.92,471.61,7.41,7.97" target="#foot_3">10</ref> to Tensorflow 2.1.0 of the implementation of the Mask R-CNN model implemented by Abdulla<ref type="foot" coords="6,174.30,485.16,7.41,7.97" target="#foot_4">11</ref> has been used to implement the Mask R-CNN. The OD process included no data augmentation. A threshold of 0.3 was used for the minimum detection confidence. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG) was used to optimize the model weights, with a momentum value of 0.9, a weight decay of 10 -4 and a mini-batch size of 8.</p><p>The annotated snake images were available from the winning solution of round 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,460.03,541.11,17.79,10.91" target="#b36">[33]</ref> of the AICrowd Snake Species Identification Challenge. This dataset contained annotated bounding boxes for 1,426 snake images which was a subset of round 2 <ref type="bibr" coords="6,353.71,568.21,17.76,10.91" target="#b36">[33]</ref> of the AICrowd Snake Species Identification Challenge.</p><p>The risk of using OD as a preprocessing step for species identification was that important background information was excluded from the images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Image Pre-processing</head><p>Deep learning models expect the input of squared images. However, the ROIs which were extracted from the OD procedure do not have predefined dimensions. Thus, the ROIs need to be transformed to the image dimensions of the deep learning model. If all ROI dimensions were larger than the image dimensions of the deep learning model, the ROIs were resized. Images that were smaller than the image dimensions of the deep learning model, were not resized. The aspect ratio of the ROIs was not modified during the image preprocessing. Thus, occurring borders were padded using a specified color. In this approach, the image borders, which result from non-squared OD results were padded with the mean color of the truncated image parts, to find a color that matched the image best <ref type="bibr" coords="7,271.20,215.93,16.25,10.91" target="#b40">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Data Augmentation</head><p>Data augmentation has been used to increase the training image dataset by adding slightly modified copies from existing training images to the training dataset. This method helps to reduce overfitting in deep learning models <ref type="bibr" coords="7,275.87,292.75,16.09,10.91" target="#b41">[38]</ref>. For the subsequently used classification models, different data augmentation procedures were implemented.</p><p>For all EfficientNet models, the data augmentation pipeline includes random cropping of the images from a size of 430 × 430 pixels to 380 × 380 pixels, random rotation in the range of ±40 ∘ , a width shift, height shift, random shearing and zooming each with a factor of 0.2 as well as a random horizontal flipping. During the data augmentation procedure, missing image positions were padded with the color of the nearest pixel neighbour. Additionally, the Lanczos interpolation <ref type="bibr" coords="7,150.19,387.60,17.91,10.91" target="#b42">[39]</ref> was used.</p><p>For the ViT models, the augmentation pipeline included random cropping from an image size of 250 × 250 to 224 × 224, and a random horizontal as well as vertical flip each with a probability of 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Classification</head><p>Two different model types, as well as an ensemble, were trained to detect snake species. Effi-cientNets were already used in the SnakeCLEF 2020 challenge from the FHDO BCSG <ref type="bibr" coords="7,477.62,491.52,11.58,10.91" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In comparison to those models, ViT models were used to compare their results and to examine if an ensemble of both models can improve the classification results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.1.">EfficientNets</head><p>EfficientNets <ref type="bibr" coords="7,150.90,567.95,18.07,10.91" target="#b31">[29]</ref> are an optimized CNN based model family. The base architecture of Effi-cientNets was developed by a CNN architecture search, which was optimized for accuracy and Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). The main building blocks of the resulting EfficientNets are Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolutional (MBConv) layers. The base model is successively scaled up using a uniform balance between model depth, model width and image resolution. The developed model architecture achieved state of the art performances on the ImageNet classification task while being smaller and faster than many of the compared models <ref type="bibr" coords="7,123.74,662.79,16.25,10.91" target="#b31">[29]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, EfficientNet-B4 models were trained to differentiate between snake species.

Instead of using convolutional operations which focus on local parts of the image, ViTs consider the whole image in parallel. ViT were based on the self-attention principle <ref type="bibr" coords="8,433.57,436.70,16.42,10.91" target="#b46">[43]</ref>, which was previously applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model design of ViTs follows the Transformers which have been introduced in NLP <ref type="bibr" coords="8,338.78,463.80,16.41,10.91" target="#b46">[43]</ref>. In ViTs, the input image is first disassembled into a set number of patches. Additionally, the position of the patch is encoded by a positional encoder. Multiple transformer encoders, which each mainly consists of Multiheaded Self-Attention (MSA) layers and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were used to encode the image patches. Another MLP is trained to learn the overall classification from the image encoding. Two different ViT models were trained in this research. First, a ViT Base model architecture with an image size of 224 × 224 pixels, a patch size of 16 × 16 pixels which was pre-trained on the ImageNet21k dataset was used. This model was trained using a mini-batch size of 70, a learning rate of 10 -5 an Adam optimizer (𝛽 1 = 0.9, 𝛽 2 = 0.999, 𝜖 = 10 -8 ) and cross-entropy loss. The ViT Base model contained 86,392,324 parameters.</p><p>During the challenge, another ViT model was trained. The architecture of this model was a ViT Large model with an image size of 224 × 224 pixels and a patch size of 16 × 16 pixels. This model was also initialized using the weights achieved for the ImageNet21k dataset. During the training of this model, a mini-batch size of 18 was used and a learning rate of 10 -5 . This model was also trained using an Adam optimizer (𝛽 1 = 0.9, 𝛽 2 = 0.999, 𝜖 = 10 -8 ) and cross-entropy loss. The ViT Large model contained 304,092,932 parameters.</p><p>The pre-trained ViT models were loaded from the Python library timm v0.4.8 <ref type="bibr" coords="9,431.94,86.97,17.76,10.91" target="#b47">[44]</ref> and PyTorch v1.8.0+cu101 <ref type="bibr" coords="9,148.87,100.52,17.91,10.91" target="#b48">[45]</ref> was used to train the model.</p><p>No class weight oversampling was used for all ViT models in our experiments. Preliminary experimental tests on the training dataset showed decreased classification results using the class weight function used for the EfficientNets with the described ViT models and given hyperparameters. However, due to reasons of time limitations during the challenge, no complex hyperparameter optimization was applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3.">Ensemble Model</head><p>In addition, a simple ensemble model was added in the experiments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Adding Location Information</head><p>The last part of the ML workflow was to optionally add location information to probability predictions of the classification models. For this reason, the prior probabilities were estimated by the relative frequency distribution of the snake species at a location in the training and validation dataset. Two different strategies were applied to combine the location and the image information. In the first strategy, the prior probabilities of the image location were multiplied with the prediction probabilities of the image. The second strategy was similar to the first one, except that the prior probabilities were binarized with a cut-off value of 0. Thus, in the binarized strategy, prior probabilities with non-zero values were transformed to one, whereas prior probabilities with a value of zero were kept unchanged. Both strategies primarily use the country in this step, as it contains more information than the continent. The continent information was only added for images with unknown country information. For images with missing country and continent information, the prior probability of the "unknown" class was used.</p></div>

This comparison did not show a positive effect for the dataset filtering strategy in these experiments neither for the 𝐹 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑 1 -score nor the 𝐹 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑-𝑓 1 -score. One reason for this effect might be the smaller number of different images for rare classes. Another problem in the experiments was that none of the EfficientNet models saturated for the validation set, thus it was hard to do a fair comparison between the models trained on the entire and the filtered dataset. Therefore, the effect of the dataset filtering was also investigated in the post-competition experiments  described in Section 5.3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Post-Competition Experiments</head><p>As previously mentioned, due to reasons of time limitations during the competition, no fair comparison between a model that used OD and one that did not use OD was performed during the competition. The same applied to using the dataset filtering strategy. Therefore, some post-competition experiments were executed leading to the results presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,481.26,204.44,5.17,10.91" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" coords="14,115.76,217.99,3.73,10.91" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. Additionally, the implementation of the EfficientNet models showed some drawbacks. Mainly, the implementation limited the mini-batch size to a small number, which leads to a high number of required epochs before the model saturated. Therefore, the EfficientNet training pipeline was reimplemented after the competition deadline. This reimplementation was similar to the implementation of the ViT training pipeline and thus the pre-trained EfficientNet models were loaded from the Python library timm v0.4.8 <ref type="bibr" coords="14,307.02,285.73,17.84,10.91" target="#b47">[44]</ref> and PyTorch v1.8.0+cu101 <ref type="bibr" coords="14,445.15,285.73,17.84,10.91" target="#b48">[45]</ref> was used to train the models.</p><p>Following the implementation described in Section 4.5.1, EfficientNet-B4 models were used for all experiments. It should be mentioned that the reimplemented training pipeline differs from the pipeline described in Section 4.5.1. All models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Additionally, a mini-batch size of 25, a learning rate of 10 -4 an Adam optimizer (𝛽 1 = 0.9, 𝛽 2 = 0.999, 𝜖 = 10 -8 ) and cross-entropy loss were used to train the models. No additional dense layer was introduced before the classification layer. Thus, the models contain 18,932,812 parameters. Similar to the ViT implementation, no class weights were used to train the models. A scheduler was implemented which reduced the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 if the classification accuracies did not improve for five epochs. Early stopping was implemented if the loss function showed no improvement for more than eight epochs. The maximum number of epochs chosen was 100. A mixed-precision strategy was implemented to speed up the training process and increase the mini-batch size.</p><p>Similar to the ViT models, the augmentation pipeline included random cropping from an image size of 418 × 418 to 380 × 380, and a random horizontal as well as vertical flip each with a probability of 0.5.</p><p>The experimental results for the validation dataset are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="14,432.81,516.07,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_4">3</ref>. In comparison to the models submitted during the challenge, the results showed that the number of epochs to train the EfficientNet model was reduced from more than 100 to less than 10 epochs using the reimplemented pipeline. Nevertheless, the achieved results outperformed the challenge results.</p><p>The effect of two pipeline modules was investigated. First, the effect of the dataset filtering strategy was examined by training two models, model S8 was trained on the entire training dataset and model S9 used the filtered training set. As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,427.07,597.37,3.72,10.91">6</ref>, the comparison of both models showed improved results for model S9. Additionally, the overall best 𝐹 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑   The second experiment investigated the effect of the OD module and was visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="15,501.26,491.04,4.97,10.91">7</ref> using barplots. Therefore, the 𝐹 1 -scores achieved by model S9 were compared to those reached for model S10, trained using the OD module described in Section 4.2. It can be noted that the results of model S10 reached worse results than model S9. Thus, for this model architecture, the OD module harmed the classification results. It was assumed that this reduction of the classification results might lead from the preprocessing pipeline used after the OD. For this reason, model S11 was trained using the OD module but no further image preprocessing. It can be noted that the results for model S11 outperformed the results of model S10, and reached similar results as model S9. However, the OD showed no improvement for the validation dataset in comparison to using the unprocessed images.</p><p>All post-competition models with the binary location encoding were evaluated for the test set. The achieved results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" coords="15,308.71,640.08,3.66,10.91" target="#tab_5">4</ref>. Model B_S8 was the EfficientNet-B4 model that was trained on the entire training dataset. This model reached an 𝐹 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 1 𝐶 -score of 65.70 %. Model B_S9, which was trained for the filtered dataset, outperformed this model by reaching an The comparison between model B_S9, B_S10 and B_S11 investigated the effect of the OD module. Model B_S10 used both, the OD and image preprocessing pipelines and performed worse than model B_S9.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Overall, snake species identification is a challenging task, dealing with highly imbalanced class distributions, high intra-class variance and small inter-class variance.</p><p>The experiments investigated in this research, show that both, EfficientNets and ViTs can be successfully trained to distinguish between snake species. The best results were achieved by combining both model types using an ensemble model. ViT models which used the large architecture achieved better classification results than the ViT Base architecture. The multiplication of location information with the model predictions can improve the results of both model types.</p><p>The training dataset was also filtered for images that did not include snakes. This filtering strategy showed improvements in the post-competition experiments for the test set. The visual validation of the out-of-class images showed some misclassified images that contained snakes. It was planned to improve this filtering strategy in future work to prevent those misclassifications using more recently deep learning models for this step.</p><p>Due to time constraints, only one model was trained on the entire training and validation dataset. It was expected that a model training on the entire dataset would increase the results for the test dataset. Additionally, during the competition, most models did not reach a plateau and thus the optimal number of epochs and the optimal classification results were not achieved for the submissions. This fact may also lead to worse performances for the filtering strategy during the competition and could be surmounted in the post-competition experiments. Another drawback that resulted from time constraints was that no models were evaluated for the OD method during the challenge. Post-competition experiments overcome this limitation and the OD showed improved test results when using no image preprocessing after the OD.</p><p>As has already been prepared in the post-competition experiments, future work will address the implementation of a more uniform implementation pipeline to enable a fair comparison of EfficientNets and ViT models. Additionally, the impact of different mini-batch sizes and learning rates should be investigated more systematically. To improve the classification results, up-scaled EfficientNet and ViT architectures should also be used and the pipeline will be enhanced using EfficientNetv2 classifiers <ref type="bibr" coords="17,204.01,412.15,16.41,10.91" target="#b50">[46]</ref>.

In comparison to model FHDO-BCSG-B_S3, model FHDO-BCSG-B_S4 was trained on the unified training and validation dataset. Due to reasons of time limitations during the competition, this model was only trained for 25 instead of 113 epochs. This model showed that the classification results might be improved by training the EfficientNet-B4 model on the training and validation dataset. The best model submitted by FHDO BCSG was model FHDO-BCSG-B_S7, which was an ensemble of model S1 and model S5 and added binary location to the prediction probabilities. This model reached an 𝐹 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 1 -score of 78.75 %, an 𝐹 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 1 𝐶 of 82.88 % and an 𝐴𝐶𝐶 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 of 90.42 %. Model FHDO-BCSG-B_S7 reached fourth place in the SnakeCLEF 2021 challenge.</figDesc></figure>
