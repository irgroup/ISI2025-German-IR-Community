<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>profiling deals with identification of various details about the author of the text (e.g., age, cultural background, gender, native language, personality). In this paper, we describe the participation of our teams (yigal18 and miller18, both teams contain the same people, but in another order) in the PAN 2018 shared task on author profiling, identifying authors' gender where for each author, 100 tweets and 10 images are provided. The authors were grouped by the language of their tweets: English, Spanish, and Arabic. In this paper, we describe our pre-processing, feature sets, machine learning methods and accuracy results. The best results using the textual features were achieved using the MLP method after applying the L normalization and using 9,000 word unigrams for English, 10,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature for Spanish, and 7,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature for Arabic. We also tried various additional feature sets, including style-based feature sets. In most of the cases, these features did not improve the results and in a few cases even hurt the results. The best result (61.54%) for the visual features was obtained by the LR method using all the features (SIFT &amp; Color &amp; VGG) and the best basic feature set is the VGG. The best result for the combined features was achieved using model2 (miller18) with 0.75 as a weight to the best textual model and a weight of 0.25 for NN Classifier (Keras) using only the 1000 VGG features.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Author profiling deals with analysis of a given text while inferring various information about the author of the text (e.g., age, cultural background, gender, native language, personality). This problem is of growing importance all over the world. Important and interesting applications can be found in business intelligence, forensics, psychology, and security. A linguistic analysis of a given text can help to identify certain characteristics of the author. For example, companies would like to know, based on the analysis of online product reviews, the demographics of people who like or dislike their products.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the participation of our teams (yigal18 and miller18, both teams contain the same people, but in another order) in the PAN 2018 shared task on author profiling. More specifically, the shared task is on gender identification of authors from their tweets and images (100 tweets and 10 images are provided for each author). The addressed languages are English, Spanish and Arabic.</p><p>We consider application of several supervised machine learning (ML) methods and various types of features for the gender identification. Content-based features and stylebased features are extracted from the tweets and visual features are extracted from the images.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background and presents some related work on text classification in general and author profiling in particular. Section 3 introduces the feature sets (content-based, style-based, and visual) that we have implemented and used in our extensive experiments. Section 4 presents the experimental setup, the experimental results using three modalities (textual feature and / or visual features) for corpora written in three languages and their analysis. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and suggests ideas for future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Text classification</head><p>TC is the supervised learning task of assigning natural language text documents to one or more predefined categories <ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.57,545.75,15.43,8.96" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. There are two main types of TC: topic-based classification and style-based classification. An example of a topic-based classification application is classifying news articles to various categories such as Business-Finance, Lifestyle-Leisure, Science-Technology and Sports, that were downloaded from three well-known news web-sites (BBC, Reuters, and TheGuardian) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.71,593.75,15.43,8.96" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>An example of a style-based classification application is classification based on different literary genres, e.g., action, comedy, crime, fantasy, historical, political, saga, and science fiction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,202.13,629.75,15.90,8.96" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,220.56,629.75,11.90,8.96" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>These two classification types often require different types of feature sets to achieve the best performance. Topic-based classification is typically performed using word unigrams and/or n-grams (n &gt; 2) ( <ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.49,665.78,10.62,8.96" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,260.42,665.78,11.97,8.96" target="#b14">15]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Author profiling</head><p>Author profiling can be viewed as a sub-task of TC. The author profiling task is of growing importance during recent years. Various author profiling applications are found in business intelligence, forensics, psychology, and security systems. The general aim of an author profiling task is to determine various |demographic information about the text's author(s), e.g., age, cultural background, gender, native language and/or dialect, and various personality traits. In this paper, we will limit ourselves to gender studies because the PAN 2018 shared task is on gender identification. The gender classification might be viewed as one of the simplest classification tasks. The classification decision can be binary and a relatively large amount of data can be collected. However, such a classification system can be effective only if the writing style between genders does differ <ref type="bibr" coords="3,261.77,332.25,16.72,8.96" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and if such stylistic differences can be detected <ref type="bibr" coords="3,124.70,344.25,15.43,8.96" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In contrast to other demographic traits, the link between gender and word use has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" coords="3,233.45,368.25,15.43,8.96" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Differences in women's and men's language have received relatively high attention within the scientific community as well as in the popular media. However, early studies on gender classification, mainly on formal texts and blogs, reported on accuracies around 75%-80% in most cases <ref type="bibr" coords="3,389.23,404.25,15.90,8.96" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,407.66,404.25,7.58,8.96" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,417.70,404.25,12.55,8.96" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,432.67,404.25,12.55,8.96" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,447.70,404.25,7.24,8.96" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</p><p>Lakoff <ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.82,416.25,16.72,8.96" target="#b26">[27]</ref> found that women use less assertive speech that manifests itself in a higher degree of politeness, less swearing, more frequent tag questions (e.g., "it is …, isn't it?"), more intensifiers (e.g., really, so), and more hedges (e.g., sort of, perhaps, maybe; also known as qualifiers or uncertainty words).</p><p>Mulac et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,188.93,464.27,16.72,8.96" target="#b31">[32]</ref> summarized the findings of more than 30 empirical studies and reported that typical female language features contain intensive adverbs (e.g., really, so), references to emotions, uncertainty verbs (seems to, maybe), negations (e.g., not, never), and hedges; while typical male language features include references to quantity, judgmental adjectives (e.g., good, dumb), elliptical sentences ("Great picture."), directives ("Write that down."), and "I" references.</p><p>Schler et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,188.21,536.27,16.76,8.96" target="#b44">[45]</ref> found that men's writing is more related to money, job and TV, while women's writing is more related to family, sex and eating. Argamon et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,451.66,548.27,11.39,8.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref>'s experimental results regarding gender showed that the style-based features that proved to be most useful for gender discrimination are determiners and prepositions (markers of male writing) and pronouns (markers of female writing). The content features that prove to be most useful for gender discrimination are words related to technology (male) and words related to personal life or relationships (female).</p><p>Pennebaker <ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.57,620.27,16.72,8.96" target="#b34">[35]</ref> found that women tend to use more personal pronouns and words referring to emotions. By the contrary, men tend to use more articles, long words (defined as words with more than 6 characters), nouns, and prepositions.</p><p>Rangel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,195.77,655.70,16.61,8.96" target="#b38">[39]</ref> presented in their overview paper the framework and the results for the Author Profiling task at PAN 2015, which dealt with the identification of age, gender, and personality traits of Twitter users. In comparison to previous years of PAN <ref type="bibr" coords="4,124.70,149.58,15.90,8.96" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,143.13,149.58,13.38,8.96" target="#b37">38]</ref> the PAN-15 systems achieved significantly higher accuracy values for gender identification. This may suggest that, irrespective the shorter length of individual tweets and their informality, the number of tweets per author is sufficient to profile age and gender with high accuracy. Regarding the features, it was not clear which ones were the most important ones, because the high number of different ones used and combined by the teams. Some of the best teams used the Second Order Representation and other were based on n-gram representation.</p><p>A similar phenomenon occurred in the gender classification tasks in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,423.58,230.10,15.43,8.96" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. It was difficult to highlight the contribution of any particular feature since the teams used many of them. The second order representation was used by teams that achieved first positions in some of the tasks. Likewise, the distributed representations achieved the first position in gender identification on the Dutch final evaluation.</p><p>The best resulting approaches that took part in the gender classification tasks in PAN 2017 <ref type="bibr" coords="4,172.34,299.13,16.61,8.96" target="#b41">[42]</ref> took advantage from combinations of n-grams, other content-based features, and style-based features. The best final average gender ranking (for English, Portuguese, and Spanish) shows that the best overall result (82.53%) has been obtained by Basile et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,186.92,333.69,10.75,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, who used the scikit-learn LinearSVM implementation trained with combinations of character 3-to 5-grams and word 1-to 2-grams with TF-IDF weighting with sublinear term frequency scaling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Features</head><p>In this section, we present the various types of features that we applied for the gender identification. Content-based features and style-based features are extracted from the tweets and the visual features are extracted from the images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Textual feature sets</head><p>In this sub-section, we describe the basic super-sets and sets of the textual features we use for our classification experiments: content-based features and style-based features.</p><p>Our content-based features include various n-grams sets, where each one of them is defined by the following template: number_k-n_type where number is the number of the features in the set, k is the size of the wanted skip (0no skip, 1skip of one unit, 2 -skip of 2 units, …), n is code of the grams (1 for unigrams 2 for bigrams, 3 for trigrams, …), and type is W for words or C for characters. All values are represented by TF-IDF values. The specific various n-grams sets that were applied will be presented later in the framework of the experiments.</p><p>Our style-based features include the following feature sets: Quantitative features, Orthographic features, Gender features that contain letters or words based on the special tweet text features that appear in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,285.79,619.79,4.98,8.96">7</ref> in Burger et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,355.99,619.79,10.60,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and Gender features that do not contain any letter. The Quantitative set includes 3 features: number of characters in the tweet, number of words in the tweet, and average number of characters in a word. The Orthographic set includes only one feature -the total frequency of the following characters "(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="4,168.50,667.72,101.48,9.05">: # @ $ &amp; . , ? ! - ) \ / )"</formula><p>normalized by the number of characters in the tweet. The Gender features that do not contain any letter include the frequency of each following character strings: ,): ,_! ,:_ ,!y!, !_i, _i, ooo, !_i, &lt;3, :)$, :(, _:)$, !$, _&lt;3, _b, y:_) normalized by the number of characters in the tweet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visual feature sets</head><p>In this sub-section, we describe the three basic sets of visual features we used for our classification experiments: SIFT 1 , Color 2 , and VGG 3 .</p><p>The SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm was developed by Lowe <ref type="bibr" coords="5,124.70,249.54,15.92,8.96" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,143.04,249.54,11.96,8.96" target="#b29">30]</ref>. The SIFT algorithm detects and describes local features in images. It consists of two sub-processes. The first sub-process is a process that detects interest points in an image. Interest points are where the signal in 2D space has variation that exceeds some threshold criterion and is superior to simple edge detection. The second subprocess creates a vector like descriptor. To create scale invariance, the interest points are scanned at a wide range of scales. For our experiments, we extract from each image at least 500 key-points, and describe each interest point by 128 features. In addition, we create by K-means algorithm a bag of 0111 visual words. For each image, we create a histogram of those words.</p><p>The Color algorithm extracts the colors in an image (by the RGB model) and for each color, indicates its frequency (pixels wise) in the image. Using the Colorgram 4 library we extract the 500 most frequent colors in the images, and for each image we build a histogram of the colors in it.</p><p>VGG 5 (Oxford Visual Geometry Group) is a group of researchers who built a model containing deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. Using the ORB 6 (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) system, we extract from each image at least 500 key-points. Then, we describe each key-point by a vector of VGG features. For each user we have ten images; therefore, we have at least 5000 VGG vectors for each user. Then we create for each user a histogram containing 1000 visual words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup and Results</head><p>The PAN CLEF 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,213.77,523.19,16.61,8.96" target="#b46">[47]</ref> launched an evaluation campaign. Twenty-three teams have participated in this campaign. Each team has proposed its algorithm, which has been evaluated using the TIRA platform <ref type="bibr" coords="5,281.81,547.19,15.45,8.96" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The algorithms and the results of the participated teams have been overviewed in Rangel et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,355.15,559.19,15.43,8.96" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>General approach: Our approach to authorship profiling is to apply supervised ML methods to TC as was suggested by Sebastiani <ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.67,583.19,15.43,8.96" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The process is as follows. First, given a corpus of training documents, where each document is labeled as either 'male' or 'female', we processed each document to produce values for various combinations of features from different types of features sets: content-based features, style-based features, and visual features. Second, we applied several popular ML methods on the generated combinations of features. Third, we tried additional combinations of features and parameter tuning. Finally, the best model(s) for the training data were tested on out-of-training data (i.e., test data).</p><p>Preprocessing: There is a widespread variety of text preprocessing types such as: conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters, html object removal, stopword removal, punctuation mark removal, reduction of different sets of emoticon labels to a reduced set of wildcard characters, replacement of HTTP links to wildcard characters, word stemming, word lemmatization, correction of common misspelled words, and reduction of replicated characters. Not all of them are considered as effective by all TC researchers. Many systems use only a small number of simple preprocessing types (e.g., conversion of all the uppercase letters into lowercase letters and / or stopword removal).</p><p>In our classification experiments, we tried the following text preprocessing types: L converting uppercase letters into lowercase letters, U -URL link removal, Ppunctuation mark removal, Sstopword removal, C -Error Correction, and Tstemming. The application of the S preprocessing type deletes all instances of 423 stopwords for English text (421 stopwords from Fox <ref type="bibr" coords="6,341.23,359.61,16.50,8.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref> plus the letters "x" and "z" that are not found in Fox <ref type="bibr" coords="6,225.17,371.13,15.14,8.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, yet are included in many other stopword lists).</p><p>ML methods: We applied four ML methods: MLP-Multilayer Perceptron 7 , LinearSVC -SVM with a linear kernel 8 , LR -Logistic regression 9 , and RF -Random Forest 10 .</p><p>A brief description of these ML methods follows: MLP is a feedforward neural network ML method <ref type="bibr" coords="6,212.21,428.61,16.72,8.96" target="#b20">[21]</ref> where artificial neural network (ANN) can be viewed as a weighted directed graph in which nodes are artificial neurons and directed edges (with weights) are connections from the outputs of neurons to the inputs of neurons. Support vector machine (SVM, also called support vector network) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,364.75,463.19,11.69,8.96" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is a model that assigns examples to one of two categories, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. LinearSVC is SVM with a linear kernel, which is recommended for TC because most of TC problems are linearly separable <ref type="bibr" coords="6,280.49,497.63,16.61,8.96" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and training a SVM with a linear kernel is faster compared to other kernels. Logistic regression (LR) is a variant of a statistical model that tries to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable (i.e., a class label) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,150.62,532.19,10.87,8.96" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,164.61,532.19,11.91,8.96" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression <ref type="bibr" coords="6,184.73,543.59,10.69,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. RF operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting classification for the case at hand. RF combines the "bagging" idea presented by Breiman <ref type="bibr" coords="6,234.05,566.63,11.69,8.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and random selection of features introduced by Ho <ref type="bibr" coords="6,453.94,566.63,16.72,8.96" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to construct a forest of decision trees.</p><p>Tools and information sources: We used the following tools:  Scikit-learn 11 -a library for ML methods  NLTK <ref type="foot" coords="7,187.37,148.63,6.96,6.26" target="#foot_0">12</ref> -a library that produces the various n-gram features  Numpy <ref type="foot" coords="7,190.73,161.35,6.96,6.26" target="#foot_1">13</ref> -a library that performs fast mathematical processing  Autocorrect<ref type="foot" coords="7,208.49,173.95,6.96,6.26" target="#foot_2">14</ref> -a library that automatically corrects spelling errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental results using the textual feature sets</head><p>The first TC experiments were performed for the English corpus using the four ML methods without parameter tuning and any normalization types using only sets of word unigrams. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,292.40,250.14,3.71,8.96" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. The best result is bolded. Similar experiments have been performed on various sets of word bigrams and the best accuracy result 74.95 was obtained using 20,000 word bigrams.</p><p>In our classification experiments, we tried various combinations of text preprocessing types: Lconverting uppercase letters into lowercase letters, U -URL link removal, Ppunctuation mark removal, Sstopword removal, C -Error Correction, and Tstemming. Only the lowercase preprocessing improved the TC results. Therefore, in our final experiments, we applied only this preprocessing type.</p><p>We have also tried various sets of skip character/word n-grams and various stylebased feature sets (Quantitative features, Orthographic features, Gender features that contain letters or words, and Gender features that do not contain any letter) in our feature combinations. However, they did not improve the accuracy results. Furthermore, we also applied Principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" coords="8,400.03,150.18,15.46,8.96" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, it did not improve the accuracy results.</p><p>Similar results have been achieved for the corpora in Spanish and Arabic. Eventually, based on the results of the previous experiments, we chose to apply the MLP method with the following features for the three languages:</p><p> English: combination of 9,000 word unigrams with the L normalization  Spanish: combination of 10,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature with the L normalization for  Arabic: combination of 7,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature with the L normalization This setting was used both by yigal18 and miller18. That is to say, yigal18 and miller18 used the same setting for the experiments on the test data for the textual features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experimental results using the visual feature sets</head><p>In the classification experiments using the visual features under the framework of scikit-learn <ref type="foot" coords="8,169.70,350.10,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_3">15</ref> [33], we apply seven versions of five ML methods: (1) Decision tree: default, using mean scaling16; (2) Logistic regression (C=1e-4, max_iter=1e5, using mean scaling);  <ref type="table" coords="8,341.23,447.21,4.98,8.96">2</ref> presents the final results of all possible feature sets combinations (including the basic features sets alone) using the seven versions of five ML methods on the biggest set (2000 training samples, 1000 testing samples).

LR obtained the first place for three feature combinations (columns) and SVM ('poly' kernel) obtained the first place for two other feature combinations. The best basic feature set is the VGG (best result in 4 out 7 ML methods). Two ML methods (LR and NN Classifier (Keras)) obtained results above 61% using the VGG features that are very close to the best result in the table that was obtained by all the features. This means that the VGG probably contributes the most and the two other feature sets almost did not contribute.</p><p>For the first model (yigal18) we used the following features: 1000 VGG features, 1000 SIFT features, and 500 Color features. The learning method was a Logistic Regression (C=1e -2 ), with mean scaling.</p><p>For the second model (miller18), we used only the 1000 VGG features.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experimental results using both the textual and visual feature sets</head><p>For this experiment, we used two different models (yigal18 and miller18). The construction of each model was performed according to the same general method: the data was separately classified by the visual and textual features, and using the next formula we combined the two classifications into a final classification.</p><p>𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑏𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖 ) = 𝛼 * 𝑃 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 (𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖 ) + (1 -𝛼) * 𝑃 𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑎𝑙 (𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖 )</p><p>For each model, we used the same setting for the textual features (see sub-section 4.1) and the MLP method. Different settings of the visual features and different ML methods have been applied by the two models. The first model (yigal18) applied Logistic Regression on the following visual features: 1000 VGG features, 1000 SIFT features, and 500 Color features. The value of α was set to 0.5, which means that we gave equal weighs for the textual and visual components.</p><p>The second model (miller18) used as its visual features only the 1000 VGG features. The chosen ML method was the NN Classifier (Keras) (with 64 hidden units at one layer). The textual features remain the same since their results in the first model were relatively high. The value of α was set to 0.75 (i.e., giving higher weight for textual features because they obtained better results).</p><p>The results of the two models yigal18 and miller18 are presented in Tables <ref type="table" coords="10,438.57,258.18,4.98,8.96" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="10,463.01,258.18,3.76,8.96" target="#tab_4">4</ref>, respectively. The best results for the other modalities are in bold. The comparison of the yigal18 (model1, Table <ref type="table" coords="10,330.39,461.87,4.17,8.96" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) and miller18 (model2, Table <ref type="table" coords="10,461.94,461.87,4.12,8.96" target="#tab_4">4</ref>) leads to the following findings and perhaps to the following conclusions. (1) Regarding the visual results, there is a decrease in two languages (Spanish &amp; Arabic) and an increase in English. A possible explanation is that using all the visual features (SIFT &amp; Color&amp; VGG) leads to slightly better results than using only the VGG features. (2) Regarding the combined results, there is an increase in two languages (English &amp; Spanish) and no change for Arabic. The improvements in miller18 (model2) are probably because of the upgrade of alpha from 0.5 to 0.75. That is to say, i.e., higher weight for the textual features leads to better combined results. (3) The second visual model run faster due to the lower number of features (1000 VGG features), in contrast to the first model (all the 2500 visual features). ( <ref type="formula" coords="10,318.73,576.95,3.90,8.96">4</ref>) The result of the combined features for model2 is better than the result of the textual features for model2. This finding means that the visual features slightly contribute to improve the result obtained by the textual features. This phenomenon did not occur in all other cases in both models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Summary and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we describe our participation in the PAN 2018 shared task on author profiling, identifying authors' gender, based on their images and tweets. We tried various pre-processing types, a widespread variety of feature sets, and four ML methods.</p><p>The best results using the textual features were achieved using the MLP method after applying the L normalization and using 9,000 word unigrams for English, 10,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature for Spanish, and 7,000 word unigrams and one orthographic feature for Arabic.</p><p>The best result (61.54%) for the visual features was obtained by the LR method using all the features (SIFT &amp; Color &amp; VGG). The best basic feature set is the VGG. Two other results (also above 61%) were obtained while applying LR and NN (Keras) using the VGG features. This means that the VGG probably contributes the most and the two other feature sets almost did not contribute.</p><p>The best results using the combined features were achieved using model2 with 0.75 as a weight to the textual features and 0.25 as a weight to the visual features. For the textual features we used the best model that was used also in model1 (sub-section 5.3). For the visual features of the second model, we use only the 1000 VGG features. The chosen ML method was the NN Classifier (Keras) (with 64 hidden units at one layer).</p><p>Future research proposals include: (1) applying additional combinations of feature sets; (2) tuning each model (textual and visual) separately; (3) tuning the value of alpha to find the best combined model; <ref type="bibr" coords="11,263.97,366.21,11.69,8.96" target="#b3">(4)</ref> developing a new combined model performing multi-modal fusion using the textual and visual modalities; (5) applying various deep neural models; and (6) building model that will perform author profiling in general and gender prediction in particular using keyphrases <ref type="bibr" coords="11,317.37,402.21,16.68,8.96" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="11,334.04,402.21,12.51,8.96" target="#b13">14]</ref> that distinguish each of classes in general and each gender in paticular.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="8,186.42,375.21,284.04,8.96;8,124.70,387.21,345.73,8.96;8,124.70,399.21,345.78,8.96;8,124.70,411.21,345.48,8.96;8,124.70,423.21,228.40,8.96;8,136.10,435.21,334.31,8.96;8,124.70,447.21,213.60,8.96"><head>( 3 )</head><label>3</label><figDesc>SVM ('poly' kernel): C=1e-3, gamma=.01, using mean scaling; (4) SVM ('rbf' kernel): C=1e-4, gamma=.01; (5) SDGClassifier: epsilon=0.7, max_iter=10000;(6) NN Classifier (version 1): activation='relu', alpha=1e2, hideen_layers=(64, ), epsilon=0.8, using mean scaling; and (7) NN Classifier (version 2): activation='relu', epoches=30, hideen_layers=(16,1, ).
