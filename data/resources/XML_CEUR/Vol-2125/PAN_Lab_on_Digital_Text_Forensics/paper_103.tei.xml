<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes and evaluates a model for cross-domain authorship attribution using Bidirectional Echo State Network-based (ESN) Reservoir Computing. We applied this model to the cross-domain authorship attribution task of the PAN18 challenge and show that it can be applied to this task. This BD-ESN based on a word embedding layer of dimension 300 reaches an averaged F-1 score of 0.408 on the development corpus and 0.3870 on the test corpus. The evaluation is based on a collections of Fanfiction gathered online, covering different original work of art.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In natural language processing, one might ask : who is the author of a given text or document?, based on training corpus and a set of corresponding authors. This task is known as authorship attribution and the motives behind this are multiple. For example, authorship attribution can be applied to forensic linguistic investigation for cases of phishing, spam, threats or cyber-bullying, or for any investigation requiring to identify the true author of a threatening letter or email based on some text written by potential suspects.</p><p>A common variety of authorship attribution task is cross-domain authorship attribution where given sample of documents coming from a finite and restricted set of candidate authors are used to determine the most likely author of a previously unseen document with unknown authorship. This tasks is made harder when documents of known and unknown authorship are from different genre and thematic area.</p><p>The classical line of research on authorship attribution is based on statistical methods and researchers applied neural network methods with good results but with long training time and high complexity. Neural models like Deep-learning are known to be very efficient on image or video classification tasks. However, Deep-learning have face more troubles on NLP tasks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied successfully to tasks like authorship attribution.</p><p>However, RNNs are known to be difficult to train and suffer from the problem of vanishing gradient, and use back-propagation through time (BPTT) which unfolds a network in time. It's in this context of slow and painful progress that a new approach, named Reservoir Computing, has been discovered independently by researchers in the field of machine learning under the name Echo State Network (ESN) and by Neuroscientists as Liquid State Machine (LSM). The key concept is to separate the part where the computing is done and the output layer where the training is done. The reservoir part is randomly constructed and training only the output layer is often enough to have good performances in practice. The training of an ESN is thus not only easier, since it is done only on the output layer, but also because it results in solving a system of linear equation. ESN has been applied to a large field of scientific domains, from astrophysics to robotic motor control and interaction, temporal series forecasting and classification in finance and weather forecasting, to image classification on the MNIST dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.84,226.91,10.79,8.64" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,472.29,226.91,8.30,8.64" target="#b6">7]</ref> and to gender profiling <ref type="bibr" coords="2,228.29,238.86,10.79,8.64" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,240.75,238.86,7.19,8.64" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>As this year PAN18 challenge proposes a cross-domain authorship attribution task, we decided to evaluate an echo state network-based Resevoir Computing model on this task. This paper is organised as follow. Section 2 introduces the dataset used for development and testing, as well as the measures and methodology used to evaluate our approach. Section 3 explains the proposed Echo State Network-based Reservoir Computing model used to classify the texts. In section 4, we evaluate the strategy we created and compare results on the test collections. In the last section, we draw conclusions on the main findings and possible future improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Corpus and Methodology</head><p>To compare different experimental results on cross-domain authorship attribution task with different models, we need a common ground composed of the same datasets and evaluation measures. In order to create this common ground, and to allow the large study in the domain of cross-domain authorship attribution, the PAN CLEF evaluation campaign was launched <ref type="bibr" coords="2,232.35,436.69,10.58,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Multiple research groups with different backgrounds from around the world have proposed a classification algorithm to be evaluated in the PAN CLEF 2018 campaign <ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.26,460.60,10.79,8.64" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.71,460.60,8.30,8.64" target="#b0">1]</ref> with the same methodology <ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.40,460.60,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>All teams have used the TIRA platform to evaluate their strategy. This platform can be used to automatically deploy and evaluate a software <ref type="bibr" coords="2,348.26,484.51,10.58,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The algorithms are evaluated The training collection on a common evaluation dataset and with the same measures, but also on the base of the time need to produce the response. The access to this evaluation dataset is restricted so that there is no data leakage to the participants during a software run.</p><p>To create our algorithm for the PAN CLEF 2018 evaluation campaign, a development corpus was created with highly similar characteristics to the evaluation corpus comprising a set of cross-domain authorship attribution problems for 5 languages, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Polish. The term "training corpus" is not used because the sets of possible authors of the development and evaluation corpora is not overlapping. Based on these collection, the problem to address was to identify the authors of a set of unknown documents given another set of documents (known fanfics) written by a small set (5 to 20) of candidate authors.</p><p>The development corpus is composed of 10 problems, 2 per language with various number of known and unknown documents. An overview of this corpus is depicted in table 1. The number of known and unknown documents is given under the label "Known" and "Unknown" and the size of the author set for each problem under the label "Authors". Each author has written at least one of the unknown document and all documents belong to the same fandom. However, known document belong to several fandoms excluding target fandom and is not necessarily the same for all candidate authors. Fanfiction refers to a form of litterature produced by admirers ("fans") of certain authors, novel or TV series, and is also known as transformative literature. The fandom refers the original work of art or genre.</p><p>A corpus with similar characteristics will be used to compare the participants' software of the PAN CLEF 2018 campaign, and we don't have information about its size due to the TIRA system. The response of the software is the name of the predicted author for each unknown document belong to each language. The overall performance of the system is the macro-averaged F-1 score.</p></div>

The matrix 𝑖𝑛 𝑊 ∈ 𝑅 𝑁𝑥×𝑁𝑢 , with 𝑁 𝑢 the dimension of the input signal, represents the weights applied to the inputs 𝑢 𝑡 , and 𝑊 ∈ 𝑅 𝑁𝑥×𝑁𝑥 is the matrix of internal weights. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,234.77,566.14,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the complete ESN architecture. We start usually by a null state 𝑥 𝑡 = 0 for the initial vector. 𝑎 is the leaky rate which allows to adapt the network's dynamic to the one of the task to learn and </p><p>where 𝜆 is the regularisation factor which must be fined tuned for each specific task.</p><p>The matrices of internal weights 𝑊 and input-to-reservoir weights 𝑖𝑛 𝑊 are generated randomly. The leaky rate 𝛼 is tuned using grid search. Some parameters should be taken into account at the creation of the reservoir weights. More precisely, it is necessary to ensure the presence of the Echo State Property which guaranties that inputs will vanish with time and will not be amplified. The most commonly used method to ensure that a reservoir has the Echo State Property is to set its spectral radius below 1. The spectral radius of a matrix 𝑊 , noted 𝜌(𝑊 ), is its highest absolute Eigen value.</p><p>To transform input text to input signal, we used word embedding pre-trained with Glove. The text is fed into the reservoir word after word which result in an input time series of dimension 300.</p><p>In this paper, we used a specific variety of ESN named Bidirectional-ESN (BDESN).

Based on the hypothesis that textual documents of known authors can be used to identify the author of unknown documents, we introduced an ESN classifier for document classification that can predict this characteristics.
