<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The rise of the internet and social media has brought a plethora of user generated content. Since an important amount of users post in pseudonymity, author profiling tasks, such as age and gender identification, have become a compelling area of study. For example, in the case of online harassment, one might be interested in identifying the perpetrator. This naturally extends to other applications in fields of forensics and security. Similarly, social sciences might be interested to use this as a jumping-off point to study how different demographics interact with media.</p><p>In this work, we describe our submission to the author profiling task at PAN 2018 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,468.47,488.43,11.45,8.64" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,479.92,488.43,7.64,8.64" target="#b8">9]</ref> on gender identification based on text and images posted by users of social media. We compare different unigram weighing schemes for this task, which are the basis of our approach. Our submitted system achieved accuracies of 77.42% for English, 74.64% for Spanish, and 73.20% for Arabic Twitter messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Task Description</head><p>The goal of the author profiling task at PAN 2018 is to identify the gender of a user based on based on two input data: text written by the user, and images posted by the user on social media (not necessarily showing themselves). There are 3 different languages in the training data: English (3000 users), Spanish (3000 users), and Arabic (1500 users). The splits of male and female labeled authors are balanced for every language. For every user there are 100 messages and 10 images that the user posted to Twitter. The competition consists of three subtasks: gender_txt: identify gender from text only, gender_img: identify gender from images only, and gender_comb: identify gender from both text and images.</p><p>We participated in the gender_txt subtask for all three languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Related Work</head><p>This year's author profiling task is a continuation of a series of related tasks from previous years <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.66,205.57,10.79,8.64" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,184.45,205.57,7.19,8.64" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Most similar edition is the 2017 instance of the task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,401.16,205.57,10.58,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, as it was using a very similar multilingual text data set based on Twitter and also had a gender identification subtask. The authors of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,249.98,229.49,11.62,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref> achieved the highest average accuracy over languages in the gender identification task, attaining accuracies of 82.33% for English, 83.21% for Spanish, and 80.06% for Arabic. They use word and character n-grams weighted by TF-IDF. Our work follows a similar approach. The VarDial evaluation campaign <ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.73,265.35,11.62,8.64" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is a similar competition, which focuses mainly on dialect identification, which has been a topic of previous tasks at PAN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Description</head><p>Our system uses the same approach for every language. First we preprocess the tweets to handle idiosyncrasies such as hashtags and user handles. Then we extract word unigram features, character n-gram features and emoji unigram features. Finally, we train a logistic regression classifier with those features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preprocessing</head><p>We use the same basic preprocessing pipeline for all languages. First we substitute user mentions, email addresses, and URLs with special tokens. We use the regular expression '@\S+' to find and replace user mentions and '\S+@\S+' for email addresses. Inspired by the URLExtract<ref type="foot" coords="2,329.87,466.04,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_0">3</ref> library we identify top-level domain names in the text and check the boundaries to find URLs. To handle Twitter's hashtags, we remove all '#' characters from the text and replace '_' (underscore) by a space character. Next we tokenize the text using the WordPunctTokenizer provided by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK, version 3.3) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,289.44,515.53,10.58,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Finally we lowercase all tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Feature Extraction</head><p>TF-ID u F: The TF-ID u F score was introduced in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.64,565.87,11.62,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as an alternative weighting scheme to the traditional TF-IDF weighting, based on a user's document collection. For a given term t it is computed as: T F -ID u F = tf (t) log( Nu nu(t) ), where tf (t) is the term frequency of t, N u is the number of documents for user u, and n u (t) is the number of documents for user u that contain the term t. We decided to apply this method because, since we handle all of one author's texts at once, we can implement it in a stateless fashion.</p><p>Word Features: For every tweet of a user, we compute T F -ID u F features as described above. We compute the vocabulary of considered terms by retaining all terms that appear in the document collections of at least 2 users. In addition we set all nonzero term frequencies to 1 as we expect this to be less noisy than full term frequencies for short texts such as tweets. Character Features: We extract character n-gram features for n ranging from 1 to 5. Every n-gram is considered at most once per tweet, and we use the hashing trick <ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.99,191.04,16.60,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to get a feature vector of dimension 2 20 .</p><p>We use HashingVectorizer, the implementation provided by the Scikit-learn (sklearn, version 3.3) framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.07,227.00,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Since this implementation expects complete strings as input, we join the tokens from the preprocessing step with a whitespace character. This leads to n-grams spanning across word boundaries. Emoji Features: Using the emoji<ref type="foot" coords="3,275.98,261.19,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">4</ref> library, we extract emoji from tweets and weigh them using TF-ID u F with the same settings as for word tokens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Classification</head><p>We train a separate logistic regression classifier for each language, applying the Logis-ticRegression implementation provided by sklearn <ref type="bibr" coords="3,338.54,337.46,10.58,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We use every text of every user as a separate sample for training, with the gender of the respective authors as labels. At inference time we get predictions for every text of an author from the classifier and predict the majority label. We performed ablation experiments to compare different ways of weighing the terms in a document. First we examine the performance of the different unigram weighing approaches on their own: tf is the system that uses raw term frequencies directly, tf-idf is the standard TF-IDF weighing of terms, and tf-iduf is the TF-ID u F as described in Section 2.2. tf-iduf &amp; chars uses word unigrams weighed by TF-ID u F and character 1to 5-grams. Finally, we refer as full to the system incorporating all features as described in Section 2. This is the system that we submitted to the competition.</p><p>To run the experiment we split the provided training data randomly into a training set and validation set. The split ratio of training to validation size is 80:20, i.e. 2400 authors for training and 600 for validation in the case of English and Spanish and 1200 authors for training and 300 for validation for Arabic.</p><p>Each experiment is run 5 times and we report mean and standard deviation. The numeric results are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,279.20,444.24,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,333.69,444.24,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives a qualitative overview of the results. The bars show the mean accuracy on the validation split for each system and language. The error bars indicate the standard deviation. The horizontal lines show the results of our submission in the competition for reference.</p><p>There seem to be no qualitative differences between the explored feature sets and weighing schemes. The mean accuracies stay mostly within the error bars of each other per language. Furthermore for English and Arabic the validation accuracy is close to the accuracy attained by our submission. For Spanish the validation accuracy is apparently lower than the accuracy of our submission, but this might well be due to random chance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>We have given an overview of our classification system for gender identification. Our system attained accuracies of 77.42% for English, 74.64% for Spanish, and 73.20% for Arabic Twitter messages at the author profiling task at PAN 2018. We explored different word unigram weighing schemes and found that they all give similar performance when applied to our system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,191.92,309.61,231.52,8.12"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
