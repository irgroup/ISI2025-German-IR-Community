<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Developing methods for the early detection of mental disorders like depression and anorexia based on written text has become an important aspect with the rise of social media platforms. The CLEF 2018 eRisk shared task consists of two subtasks focussed on the detection of these two disorders and FHDO Biomedical Computer Science Group (BCSG) has submitted results obtained from four machine learning models as well as from a final late fusion ensemble. This paper describes these models based on user-level linguistic metadata, Bags of Words (BoW), neural word embeddings, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the participation of FHDO Biomedical Computer Science Group (BCSG) at the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2018 eRisk task for early detection of depression and anorexia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,416.25,584.33,15.50,8.80" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,433.41,584.33,11.62,8.80" target="#b12">13]</ref>. BCSG submitted results obtained from four different models and a late fusion ensemble of three of these models. These models as well as the findings concerning the dataset are described in this paper and an outlook on possible improvements and future research is given. The work described in this paper is based on this team's previous participation in the eRisk 2017 pilot task for early detection of depression <ref type="bibr" coords="1,183.06,656.06,15.50,8.80" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and on further research based on the same dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="1,425.81,656.06,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Studies concerning the effect of mental state on the language used by a person have already shown various connections, beginning with observations of more frequent uses of first personal singular pronouns in spoken language of depression patients <ref type="bibr" coords="2,173.21,180.63,10.52,8.80" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.39,180.63,11.62,8.80" target="#b28">29]</ref>. More recent studies found, for example, an elevated use of the word "I" in particular and more negative emotion words in essays by depressed college students <ref type="bibr" coords="2,205.09,204.54,14.61,8.80" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, more verbs in past tense and pronouns in general spoken by Russian depression patients <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.04,216.50,14.61,8.80" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and a more frequent use of absolutist words (e.g. absolutely, completely, every, nothing) in forums related to depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation than in unrelated forums or forums about asthma, diabetes, and cancer <ref type="bibr" coords="2,185.16,252.36,9.96,8.80" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Results like these have lead to the development of tools that allow researchers and therapists to evaluate written texts with a focus on the author's mental state. One such tool is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.32,288.61,14.61,8.80" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, which calculates a total of 93 features for any given text document based on a dictionary. Similarly, Differential Language Analysis Toolkit (DLATK) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,445.98,312.52,15.50,8.80" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was published as an open-source Python library for text analysis with a focus on psychology, health, and social aspects.</p><p>First results in the area of early detection of depression based on written social media texts have been reported as part of the eRisk 2017 pilot task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.33,360.73,14.61,8.80" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Similar research without the early detection aspect has previously been done, for example, at the CLPsych shared task for detection of depression and PTSD on Twitter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.45,396.60,9.96,8.80" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In the same domain as this task, data from reddit.com has recently been utilized to successfully detect messages concerning anxiety <ref type="bibr" coords="2,416.30,408.55,14.61,8.80" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Datasets and Tasks</head><p>Similar to the task in 2017, the datasets of both subtasks consist of messages obtained from the social media platform reddit.com. The training data of the depression subtask is equivalent to the full training and test data of this previous task, while the anorexia subtask is based on completely new messages. An especially interesting aspect of reddit is that it allows users to create communities with specific topics called subreddits. There exists a wide variety of these communities, also including very active ones from a depression detection perspective, like /r/depression<ref type="foot" coords="2,211.87,550.32,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_0">5</ref> , which is mainly used by people struggling with depression.</p><p>The messages contained in both datasets can consist of a separate title and text field depending on the type of message: Users can post content in terms of links or images (only title, link or image not included), text content (title and optional text), or as comment on another message (only text). Some messages in both datasets also include no text or title and can therefore be discarded. The number of documents per user ranges between 10 and 2000. In every week of the test phase, a chunk of 10% of each user's messages is supplied to the participants in chronological order, resulting in 1 to 200 documents per user each week. In both subtasks there are exceptions of this general rule because one anorexia training user (subject2167 of the control group), three depression test users (subject5161, subject5301, and subject8719), and two anorexia test users (subject4169 and subject7483) do not have any messages in the final week, resulting in only 9 messages of these users.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,177.86,190.66,4.98,8.80" target="#tab_0">1</ref> displays the main characteristics of the two datasets. The average amount of characters and unigrams per document was calculated based on a concatenation of the text and title field. To calculate the number of unigrams, the same preprocessing and tokenization as described in sections 4.3 and 4.4 was utilized, retaining only words that occur in the writings of at least two users. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Hand-crafted User Features</head><p>The participation of this team in the eRisk 2017 pilot task was based on a set of user-level linguistic metadata features that were used as additional input for every model. In this second eRisk shared task, only one submitted model (see section 4.1) and the final late fusion ensemble (see section 4.5) use metadata features. All text based features have again been calculated based on a concatenation of the text and title field of each message. Still, this includes the same set of features described in the previous working notes paper <ref type="bibr" coords="3,385.57,560.42,15.50,8.80" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and an additional set of ten features obtained from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,584.33,15.50,8.80" target="#b25">[26]</ref> software. These LIWC features have been chosen based on their correlation with the class label in the depression subtask training data. Another addition to the original feature set is the average length of the title field that was also not used in 2017. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,181.20,632.15,4.98,8.80" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the correlation matrix of the complete metadata feature set and includes the class label information to indicate the relevance of each feature. Although some features-especially the pronoun counts-seem redundant at first sight, all of the original features are preserved as they are based on a Part of Speech (POS) tagging using the Python NLTK framework<ref type="foot" coords="4,420.54,129.33,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_1">6</ref> while LIWC features are based on a lexicon that also includes abbreviations or common misspellings. Most of the described features are averaged over all documents per user to obtain the final metadata feature vector, except for the counts of specific phrases like medication names or mentioned diagnoses which are summed. Finally, all averaged features are standardized to have unit variance and a mean of 0 and the summed features are converted to flags with a value of 1 for users that have used such a phrase in any document and -1 otherwise.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Chosen Models</head><p>This section describes the five models that have been used to classify the test users of both subtasks. The models for both tasks are completely identical, use the same set of metadata features, and only vary slightly in their prediction thresholds as described below. In comparison to this team's participation in the eRisk 2017 pilot task, the prediction thresholds were simplified: For each model, only a single prediction threshold value was chosen based on cross-validation on the training data to indicate whether a subject is classified as depressed. The number of documents already processed for a user is not used anymore as the new models are less prone to predict many false positives after processing only few documents. In addition, non-depressed predictions are now only submitted in the final week because early prediction of these cases has no effect on the score and later writings might still identify them as depressed. Selecting viable prediction thresholds is difficult as a balanced result according to both ERDE o and F 1 is often hard to achieve. The goal for this participation was to use rather low thresholds to find depressed cases as early as possible without generating too many false positives.</p><p>In contrast to the previous participation of this team, only the first model and the final ensemble utilize the updated set of user metadata features described in section 3.1. The bag of words model, which achieved the best overall F 1 as well as second best ERDE 5 and ERDE 50 score in the previous task <ref type="bibr" coords="5,400.00,368.02,14.61,8.80" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, is reused with and without metadata features. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer was not evaluated again and instead replaced with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This decision was based on further research using the eRisk 2017 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="5,356.86,415.85,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which showed that the CNN model was able to outperform results of the LSTM models and also easier to configure and less prone to overfitting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Bag of Words Metadata Ensemble -BCSGA</head><p>The first model is mostly equivalent to the first model used in this team's participation in eRisk 2017, except for the extended set of metadata features. It utilizes an ensemble of Bag of Words (BoW) classifiers with different term weightings and n-grams that are calculated on a user basis by first concatenating all documents (text and title) of a user. The term weighting for bags of words can generally be split into three components: a term frequency component or local weight, a document frequency component or global weight, and a normalization component <ref type="bibr" coords="5,184.53,569.32,14.61,8.80" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. A general term weighting scheme can therefore be given as <ref type="bibr" coords="5,462.33,569.32,14.61,8.80" target="#b29">[30]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,267.22,588.78,209.13,9.71">t t,d = l t,d • g t • n d , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,476.35,588.78,4.24,8.80">)</formula><p>where t t,d is the calculated weight for term t in document d, l t,d is the local weight of term t in document d, g t is the global weight of term t for all documents, and n d is the normalization factor for document d. A common example would be using the term frequency (tf ) as local weight and the inverse document frequency (idf ) as global weight, resulting in tf -idf weighting <ref type="bibr" coords="5,337.24,656.06,14.61,8.80" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>All ensemble models use l2-norm for n d but varying local and global weights. The first one uses a combination of uni-, bi-, tri-, and 4-grams obtained from the training data. To build this first BoW, the 200,000 {1, 2, 3, 4}-grams with the highest Information Gain (IG) are selected, given by [14, p. 272]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="6,136.92,176.28,341.51,27.33">I(U, C) = et∈{0,1} ec∈{0,1} P (U = e t , C = e c ) • log 2 P (U = e t , C = e c ) P (U = e t ) • P (C = e c ) ,</formula><p>(2) with the random variable U taking values e t = 1 (the document contains term t) and e t = 0 (the document does not contain term t) and the random variable C taking values e c = 1 (the document is in class c) and e c = 0 (the document is not in class c). The raw term frequency of the resulting n-grams is used as local weight, while their IG-score is used as global weight. The second BoW utilizes a modified version of tf , namely augmented term frequency (atf ) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,414.93,278.33,14.61,8.80" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, multiplied by idf :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="6,193.56,301.48,282.79,22.31">atf -idf (t, d) = a + (1 -a) tf t max(tf ) • log n d df (d, t) , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="6,476.35,308.16,4.24,8.80">)</formula><p>with max(tf ) being the maximum frequency of any term in the document, the total number of documents n d , and the smoothing parameter a, which is set to 0.3 for this model. This BoW, as well as the third one, contains all unigrams of the training corpus. The local weight of the third model consists of the logarithmic term frequency (logtf ) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,235.23,380.39,15.50,8.80" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the global weight is given by relevance frequency (rf ) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,156.55,392.34,9.96,8.80" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which can be combined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="6,180.76,413.89,295.59,23.22">logtf -rf (t, d) = (1 + log(tf )) • log 2 2 + df t,+ max (1, df t,-) , (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="6,476.35,420.57,4.24,8.80">)</formula><p>where df t,+ and df t,-is the number of documents in the depressed/non-depressed class that contain the term t. The final model of this ensemble uses the handcrafted user features described in section 3.1.</p><p>All three bags of words and the hand-crafted features were each used as input for a separate logistic regression classifier. Due to the imbalanced class distribution, a modified class weight was used for these classifiers similar to the original task paper <ref type="bibr" coords="6,220.25,520.91,15.50,8.80" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to increase the cost of false negatives. It was calculated for the non-depressed class as 1/(1 + w) and for the depressed class as w/(1 + w), with w = 2 for all four models. The final output probabilities were calculated as unweighted mean of all four logistic regression probabilities. Each week and for both tasks, this ensemble predicted any user with a probability above or equal to 0.4 as depressed, while in the final week all users with a probability less than 0.4 were predicted as non-depressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Bag of Words Ensemble -BCSGB</head><p>The second model is similar to the first one, but it only includes the three bags of words in the ensemble and disregards the metadata features. Again, for the depression subtask any test subject with a probability of at least 0.4 was predicted as depressed, while users with a probability below 0.4 were predicted as non-depressed in the final week. The prediction threshold for the anorexia subtask was set to 0.3 in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">CNN with GloVe Embeddings -BCSGC</head><p>The third model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <ref type="bibr" coords="7,433.98,204.97,14.61,8.80" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, which have previously been utilized by many recent studies to achieve outstanding results especially in the area of image classification and are generally viable for data with a grid-like structure <ref type="bibr" coords="7,269.58,240.83,9.96,8.80" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The implementation has been done based on Tensorflow <ref type="bibr" coords="7,185.10,252.79,10.52,8.80" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the input of this CNN is based on GloVe <ref type="bibr" coords="7,404.68,252.79,15.50,8.80" target="#b17">[18]</ref> word embeddings: A 50-dimensional set of word embeddings pre-trained on Wikipedia and News<ref type="foot" coords="7,157.79,275.14,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_2">7</ref> is used to produce a matrix of word vectors for the first 100 words of each document in the dataset. Prior to this vectorization, the documents are preprocessed and tokenized in a way that preserves, for example, emoticons, punctuation, words including special characters, and generally all tokens that occur in the documents of at least two users. Zero-padding is used for documents with less than 100 words. Each document is therefore represented by a 100 × 50 matrix and is classified independently. Since the number of words per document in the training data ranges between 1 (when ignoring the empty documents) and 6,487 but has a mean of 34.58 according to the tokenization done for this work, the limitation to 100 words (or even fewer to minimize the necessary zero-padding) is viable.

Due to the usage of Concatenated Rectified Linear Units (CReLU) <ref type="bibr" coords="8,337.70,166.75,15.50,8.80" target="#b22">[23]</ref> activation, this finally results in a 200-dimensional vector per document that is propagated through four fully connected layers, of which the first applies dropout to its output and the final one applies softmax. The training steps of this and the following CNN model utilized Adam <ref type="bibr" coords="8,199.61,214.58,10.52,8.80" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Both models were trained using a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 10.000 documents. BCSGC was trained for 30 epochs.</p><p>To obtain a final prediction per user, the 98th percentile of the outputs from all the user's documents is calculated. This ensures that even depressed users that have very few documents with a high probability can be correctly predicted. For both subtasks, any subject with a final probability of at least 0.4 was predicted as depressed in each week, while probabilities below 0.4 again resulted in a non-depressed prediction in the final week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">CNN with fastText Embeddings -BCSGD</head><p>The second CNN model is based on the same architecture as the previous one but utilizes 300-dimensional fastText <ref type="bibr" coords="8,282.82,374.38,10.52,8.80" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,294.99,374.38,7.75,8.80" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,304.40,374.38,12.73,8.80" target="#b14">15]</ref> word embeddings. To evaluate word vectors that are more related to the domain of reddit messages or social media in general, a new fastText model was trained specifically for this task. A dataset of all 1.7 billion reddit comments written between October 2007 and May 2015 <ref type="foot" coords="8,457.90,408.69,3.97,6.16" target="#foot_3">8</ref> was used as training corpus for this model and preprocessed similar to the description in section 4.3 but without removing infrequent words yet. In addition to this, any references to reddit users (in the form of /u/&lt;username&gt;) were replaced by a generic phrase "ref_user" to prevent any connections to actual users in the resulting word embeddings. Similarly, any reference to a subreddit (in the form of /r/&lt;subreddit&gt;) was replaced by the phrase "ref_subreddit_&lt;subreddit&gt;" to be able to learn a vector representation of them as well that can be regarded as their topic. No stemming or stopword removal of any kind was done and messages in other languages than English were removed based on stopword counts. The final corpus of 1.37 billion reddit comments was used to train 6 million word vectors of words that occur at least five times in the corpus. Additional details about this model and the utilized CNNs can be found in the corresponding paper <ref type="bibr" coords="8,134.77,565.66,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Similar to the previous CNN model, the resulting 100 × 300 matrix of word embeddings obtained for each document was classified separately and the 98th percentile of the outputs was used as output for the corresponding user. This model was trained for 25 epochs using the same parameters as BCSGC. The prediction threshold for depressed predictions was set to 0.7 for both tasks, leading to a non-depressed prediction for probabilities below 0.7 in the final week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">CNN and Bag of Words Metadata Ensemble -BCSGE</head><p>The final model consists of a simple late fusion ensemble that has been calculated as the unweighted mean of the outputs obtained from models BCSGA, BCSGC, and BCSGD -the bag of words including metadata and the two CNN models. Although these outputs have not been calibrated (e.g. by using Platt scaling <ref type="bibr" coords="9,461.22,222.52,15.50,8.80" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) and can therefore not be seen as directly comparable probabilities, previous experiments <ref type="bibr" coords="9,191.61,246.43,15.50,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref> have shown that such an ensemble was able to improve the results of the separate models. Again, a prediction threshold of at least 0.4 was used for the depression detection subtask, while a threshold of 0.5 was utilized for the anorexia subtask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>Before examining the results of the described models in the two subtasks, it is necessary to analyze the utilized ERDE o metric for early detection systems. Since this metric is based on the absolute number of documents read per user before a true positive prediction, but these documents have to be read in ten equally sized chunks, the score is highly dependent on the number of documents available per user. Because at least 10% of each user's documents have to be read by all participants, it is impossible to predict some users correctly depending on the parameter o that describes after how many documents the penalty for late predictions grows. This fact has already been described in more detail in another paper <ref type="bibr" coords="9,162.74,451.63,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="9,177.15,464.18,4.98,8.80" target="#tab_2">2</ref> displays the best ERDE 5 and ERDE 50 scores that are possible for the test data of the depression and anorexia subtask. These results are based on a perfect prediction in the first week of the tasks. As described in the abovementioned paper, only test users with less than 100 documents (less than 10 per chunk) have any effect on the ERDE 5 score. This means that only predicting 26 of the 79 depressed test users correctly in the first week and ignoring all others still leads to an ERDE 5 score of 7.78 (F 1 = 0.50), while predicting only 12 of the 41 anorexia users in the first week also leads to an ERDE 5 score of 10.23 (F 1 = 0.45). ERDE 5 alone, without the additional F 1 score, is therefore hard to interpret.</p><p>To examine the weekly predictions obtained from the described models, Figures 3 and 4 show the cumulative number of positive predictions for the two subtasks and also visualize the proportion of true positives. For the depression subtask, this shows that the ensemble indeed lead to the most true positives but also many false positives. BCSGD seems to perform worse at first sight but indeed achieved a good balance between true and false positives because of its higher prediction threshold. As the comparison of both figures shows, the anorexia subtask was much easier using the same models and that it was possible to detect nearly all positive samples without too many false positives. Both examinations show a steady progression over the ten weeks for all models. Tables <ref type="table" coords="10,181.04,476.73,4.98,8.80" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and<ref type="table" coords="10,208.73,476.73,4.98,8.80" target="#tab_4">4</ref> show the official results <ref type="bibr" coords="10,322.14,476.73,15.50,8.80" target="#b12">[13]</ref> of BCSG's models for both subtasks and also include the alternative early detection scores F latency <ref type="bibr" coords="10,444.67,488.69,15.50,8.80" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and ERDE % o <ref type="bibr" coords="10,176.98,500.64,14.61,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. According to the suggestion in the paper, F latency was calculated using a value for the parameter p that fits the true positive cost function P latency to return a cost of 0.5 for the median number of documents of the positive test users. This results in a value of p = 0.0051 for the depression subtask (median of 216 documents per depressed test user) and p = 0.0042 for the anorexia subtask (median of 260 documents per anorexia test user). In contrast to the standard ERDE o score, ERDE % o is calculated based on the percentage of read documents per user and is therefore easier to interpret in a chunk-based task. Additional results by other teams have been added to these tables to include at least the best two results obtained for each score.</p><p>While the direct comparison of BCSGA (bags of words with linguistic metadata) and BCSGB (bags of words only) shows that the metadata features result in more positive predictions, the actual amount of true positives was only better for the depression subtask and resulted in a better ERDE 5 score but worse  ERDE 50 and F 1 . Similar to the task in 2017, the bag of words ensemble again obtained the best results in the depression subtask, while the CNN based on the self-trained fastText embeddings (BCSGD) and the ensemble using both the bags of words as well as the CNNs (BCSGE) achieved the best scores in the anorexia subtask. Overall, the models of BCSG achieved the second-best results in ERDE 5 and the best results in all other scores except for another second-best result according to ERDE % 50 in the depression subtask. As already described, the ERDE o score and especially ERDE 5 should be discussed in more detail because of the fact that optimizing it can often lead to simply minimizing false positives by only predicting very few users at all. A detailed look at the results and the achieved ERDE 5 scores shows that, for example, in the first week of the depression subtask both UNSLA and BCSGA have predicted 45 users as depressed of which 20 were indeed true positives. Still, the resulting ERDE 5 score differs drastically because the predicted users vary in the number of total documents and even though UNSLA only had five more true positives in the following nine weeks, while BCSGA already had ten more in the second week and a total of 53 in the end. Similarly, the leading model in ERDE 5 of the anorexia subtask, UNSLB, had 19 true positives in the first week, while BCSGD already had 22, BCSGB had 21, and BCSGA had 20. In summary, ERDE 5 produces highly misleading results because of the varying number of documents per user.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>Again, the eRisk competition has been a challenging task concerning the early detection of mental health issues based on sequences of social media texts. The depression subtask had similar F 1 scores but much better ERDE o scores based on a test set that was nearly as large as last year's training and test set combined. The results of the anorexia subtask were surprisingly good, which probably is due to the nature of this dataset. Generally, the promising results with the test data of eRisk 2017 obtained only based on linguistic metadata <ref type="bibr" coords="12,419.08,535.95,15.50,8.80" target="#b27">[28]</ref> could not yet be confirmed in this year's tasks. As already concluded in the same paper, finding a way to successfully integrate the metadata features into the neural network models is an interesting task for future research. The examination of the task results again shows that a discussion about a meaningful metric should be a priority in the future. Both F latency and ERDE % o include interesting ideas to improve the evaluation of early prediction models. F latency contains a cost function that grows less rapidly and already incorporates the F 1 score, which makes it more meaningful when viewed alone. ERDE % o is more viable for chunk-based shared tasks because it is calculated based on the proportion of read documents per user instead of the absolute number, which leads to results that are better interpretable than the standard ERDE o . A combination of these two ideas could be a promising basis for discussions about future early detection tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,134.77,561.01,345.82,8.02;4,134.77,572.07,345.83,7.92;4,134.77,583.03,103.73,7.92"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
