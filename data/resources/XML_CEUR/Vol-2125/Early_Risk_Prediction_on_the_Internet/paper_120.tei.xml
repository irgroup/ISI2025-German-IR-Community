<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Science and Social Computing Research Group from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona (UPF) at CLEF 2018 eRisk Lab 1 . Its main goal, divided in two different tasks, is to detect, with enough anticipation, cases of depression (T1) and anorexia (T2) given a labeled dataset with texts written by social media users. Identifying depressed and anorexic individuals by using automatic early detection methods, can provide experts a tool to do further research regarding these conditions, and help people living with them. Our proposal presents several machine learning models that rely on features based on linguistic information, domain-specific vocabulary and psychological processes. The results, regarding the F-Score, place our best models among the top 5 approaches for both tasks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Symptoms associated with mental illnesses can be observable on online social networks and web forums <ref type="bibr" coords="1,255.74,493.07,14.61,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Automated methods have been developed in order to detect depression and other mental illnesses by analysing user-generated data in social media, as stated in the review by Guntuku's et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,432.45,516.98,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. These methods usually rely on classification algorithms that do not consider the delay in detecting positive cases. Losada et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,320.58,540.89,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> proposed a temporal-aware risk detection benchmark in order to consider, not only the accuracy of the decisions taken by the algorithms, but also the temporal dimension.</p><p>The early detection of signs of depression and anorexia tasks, as part of the CLEF eRisk 2018 challenge, consisted in sequentially processing texts posted by users in social media, and detecting traces of depression or anorexia as early as possible <ref type="bibr" coords="1,172.75,612.83,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,189.85,612.83,11.62,8.74" target="#b17">18]</ref>. The texts were meant to be processed in the order they were created, for a further capability of the system to analyse the interaction between users in online media, mostly blogs and social networks, in real time.</p><p>UPF submitted the results obtained by 4 different models for each task. The process for obtaining them, and the results of their application are described in this paper, along with the proposed improvements and possible further work on the subject. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reports the related work in detecting mental illnesses in social media and the application of early risk measures. Section 3 describes the two tasks addressed. Section 4 shows our research proposal, focusing on the feature extraction process and the learning algorithms used for both tasks. We report our experimental setup in Section 5, followed by our results and findings in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 summarises our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Studies have been conducted on how the usage of social media sites is correlated with mental illnesses in users <ref type="bibr" coords="2,259.88,313.38,15.70,8.74" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,275.58,313.38,11.77,8.74" target="#b24">25]</ref>. The language and words, expressed by users in social media texts, may indicate feelings of self-hatred, guilt, helplessness, and worthlessness, which are all elements that characterize depression <ref type="bibr" coords="2,429.61,337.29,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. People with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, can be identified by the usage of certain keywords that characterize and promote these conditions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.91,361.20,11.44,8.74" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.35,361.20,11.44,8.74" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>Predictive models are built to perform the automated analysis of social media. These models use features or variables that have been extracted from labeled user-generated data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,252.66,398.97,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. To collect the data, participants are either recruited to take a survey and share their social network account data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.52,410.92,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,451.20,410.92,12.73,8.74" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.09,410.92,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>, or data is collected from public online sources like Twitter, Facebook or Reddit <ref type="bibr" coords="2,150.26,434.83,70.49,8.74">[3-5, 9, 14, 22, 28]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the features that are extracted to build predictive models, the most common ones are those related to the users' texts such as: frequencies of each word or multiple words (N-grams) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,311.38,472.60,15.50,8.74" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.99,472.60,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>, topics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,378.30,472.60,15.50,8.74" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,394.89,472.60,12.73,8.74" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,408.72,472.60,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>, and features obtained using dictionaries like LIWC<ref type="foot" coords="2,301.40,482.99,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> to measure the usage of self references, social words and emotions <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.89,496.52,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,275.52,496.52,11.62,8.74" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Features based on sentiment analysis are also obtained by calculating the subjectivity or polarity of a phrase <ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.07,508.47,15.50,8.74" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,450.97,508.47,12.73,8.74" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.09,508.47,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Among other features used, we can find the ones obtained by the analysis of the user activity, like the posting frequency in different periods of the day and year <ref type="bibr" coords="2,157.08,544.34,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,169.32,544.34,11.62,8.74" target="#b9">10]</ref>. There are also some research works that obtain features from the relationships between users, considering the number of friends, or followers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.33,556.29,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>As part of the related work, some studies address the importance of an early detection of depression signs, and do an analysis with data prior to the diagnosis <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,594.06,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,151.66,594.06,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>. However, the work of Losada et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,326.98,594.06,15.50,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> proposes a new metric to measure the effectiveness of early alert systems and presents a method for detecting early traces of depression. This provides a measure to compare early detection algorithms in a systematic way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Tasks Description</head><p>T1 and T2 consisted in analysing a collection composed by chronologically ordered writings (posts or comments) from a set of social media users <ref type="bibr" coords="3,443.60,154.05,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. For T1, users were labeled as depressed and non-depressed, and for T2, users were labeled as anorexic and non-anorexic. The collection of writings of each user was split into 10 chunks, with a 10% of the total stored messages of the user in each chunk. There were two stages for each task: a train stage for which the whole history of writings for a set of training users was provided, along with the ground truth; and a test stage, which consisted of 10 sequential releases of data corresponding to each of the 10 chunks with the writings of the test users. Results were meant to be submitted after each release with either a decision for a user, e.g. depressed or not depressed, or no decision, meaning that the system required to see more chunks before deciding. This choice had to be made for each user in the collection. The metrics used for the evaluation of the system were Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and the Early Risk Detection Error (ERDE) metric, proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,222.61,309.47,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which penalizes the delay in detecting positive cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposal</head><p>The proposal defined for the challenge, which is common for tasks 1 and 2, combines a set of features extracted from the concatenated writings of each user. With these features, a model is trained to be applied afterwards to process the users' test text streams, for each task's dataset. To process the writings, the dynamic method proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.45,411.47,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is used. This method consisted in building incrementally a representation of each user, and then applying a classifier, which was previously trained with all the users writings. Following this approach, a decision is made if the classifier outputs a confidence value above a given threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Feature Extraction</head><p>The features we considered aim to characterise the content of the writings and provide statistical measures based on the posting frequency and length of the texts. The details on these features are explained below, and a summary can be found in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,201.73,543.35,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic, psychological processes and depression related vocabulary:</head><p>the content of the users' writings was characterized by calculating some scores. This was done based on the frequency of words belonging to the categories of the LIWC2007 dictionary <ref type="bibr" coords="3,232.75,608.30,14.61,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which has been previously used in detecting mental health issues <ref type="bibr" coords="3,195.42,620.25,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,207.95,620.25,7.01,8.74" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Scores based on linguistic and psychological processes, as well as personal concerns and spoken categories were obtained. The scores were calculated normalising the frequencies of words by the total number of words in the writings of a user. Given that certain words could belong to multiple categories, the normalization value was augmented in one each time a word was part of more than one category. A feature value was calculated for each of the categories defined in the LIWC2007 dictionary, the list and description of these categories can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,252.18,154.86,14.61,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>For T1, two additional domain-based features were obtained by defining antidepressants and absolutist words categories. In this sense, a list of the 10 leading psychiatric drugs as published in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,287.75,191.22,14.61,8.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and a set of absolutist words based on the work of <ref type="bibr" coords="4,190.95,203.18,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, were added. This last study concluded that the elevated use of absolutist words is a marker specific to anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>For T2, in addition to the LIWC ones, 9 more features were defined by creating categories of words that belonged to domains related with anorexia. The vocabulary for these categories was obtained from the codebook's domains and sample keywords defined in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,284.17,263.45,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The domains are: anorexia, body image, body weight, food and meals, eating, caloric restriction, binge, compensatory behavior, and exercises. Each domain was defined by a list of keywords as stated in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,146.39,299.32,9.96,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>N-grams: extensively used in text mining and natural language processing tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="4,159.85,343.65,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. They consist of sets of co-occuring words within a given window (N). Some previous works have considered them as features for detecting depression and eating disorders <ref type="bibr" coords="4,226.16,367.56,15.50,8.74" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.92,367.56,11.62,8.74" target="#b26">27]</ref>. For the implemented approaches, a tf • idf vectorization was done from the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams of the training set writings. For this step, the TfIdfVectorizer from the scikit-learn Python library<ref type="foot" coords="4,476.12,389.90,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> was used, with a stop-words list and the removal of the n-grams that appeared in less than 20 documents. The content of a document was defined by the concatenation of all the writings of a user from all the chunks, in the training phase. Trigrams did not improve the results and therefore they were not used in the models delivered, as stated in 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical features:</head><p>The number of writings of each user and the median of the words used per post were defined as features. For the models sent, these features were discarded given that they seemed to provide good results at the training stage, but the expected results were not obtained when they were tested with the dynamic method. Since these features were excluded from the models delivered, they are described as not used in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,354.47,543.40,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> Feature with weighted scores: For T1, an additional feature was defined by adding the weighted values of certain features obtained from the LIWC2007 dictionary categories. The features were selected based on the top 4 LIWC categories that were strongly correlated with positive depression cases, as stated in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,147.09,623.60,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The antidepressants and absolutist words categories were considered as well. The words belonging to these categories were given a higher weight if they were found in a subject's writing. Either the same or different weights could be assigned to each category.</p><p>In the same way, for T2, a feature was obtained based on the combination of the weighted values of the 9 features based on the categories of words that belonged to domains related with anorexia. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Learning Algorithms</head><p>Two prediction methods were explored, i.e., Logistic Regression and Random Forest, as they have been used previously as classifiers for similar tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="5,450.96,465.97,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,467.86,465.97,12.73,8.74" target="#b20">21]</ref> They are briefly explained bellow:</p><p>Logistic Regression: statistical method used to predict a binary outcome given a set of independent variables. It predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function <ref type="bibr" coords="5,323.50,532.44,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Random Forest: This classification method works by building many decision trees at training time. For the classification tasks, it outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees <ref type="bibr" coords="5,320.98,586.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experimental Setup</head><p>The main objective of our proposed models is to detect the highest amount of positive cases, and to do it as soon as possible, minimizing the ERDE and maxi-mizing the F1 Score. Python 3.6.5 <ref type="foot" coords="6,287.88,117.42,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> and, in particular, the scikit-learn Python library was used for the implementation of the proposed methods. Using the training data provided for T1, we applied 10-fold cross validation and optimized the parameters through grid search in order to maximize the F1 Score. Each instance of this dataset was defined by the features mentioned in section 4.1 and represented one user. For each user, the features were extracted from the sequentially-concatenated writings of all their chunks. The provided test set allowed us to evaluate the behavior of the dynamic method. Also, this set was used to define a threshold (see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,293.63,214.64,4.43,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) that represents the minimum probability value required by an instance to be classified as positive. The definition of this threshold contributed to the minimization of the ERDE. The performance of the method was evaluated in terms of the evaluation measures.</p><p>Similarly for T2, with all the training data provided we chose to do a 10-fold cross validation combined with grid search in order to optimize the parameters of the algorithms used. The models obtained were afterwards used to process the writings of the test data, applying the dynamic method. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>We designed four different models for each task, named UPFA, UPFB, UPFC and UPFD. Each model contained a particular set of features, and was created by applying either Logistic Regression or Random Forest classifiers. During the training phase for both tasks, the usage of the statistical features did not improve the results of the prediction with the test set, despite having offered promising results with the training set. Trigrams did not offer better results either. Therefore, these features were excluded from the selected models sent to the challenge.</p><p>The details of each model are described in Table <ref type="table" coords="7,372.81,179.01,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The scores for all the models sent for T1 and T2 can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,346.29,190.97,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Note that, regarding the ERDE, the values obtained do not evaluate the the actual performance of the models, as the decision files were not delivered to the challenge right from the first chunk and therefore the lab evaluation had to assume that the decision of our classifiers for the earlier chunks was no decision for all subjects. The results obtained with UPFA and UPFB delivered after the release of the eighth chunk since our team engaged into the lab tasks at an advanced stage. The results of models UPFC and UPFD were delivered only after the tenth chunk was released, due to a late refinement of these models. We detail the results obtained for each task in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Task 1: Depression</head><p>In this task, the best F1 score value (0.55) was provided by UPFA model, based on Logistic Regression, the use of unigrams and the categories classified by LIWC. Also, the best ERDE{5,50} scores were reported by the same model. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,162.84,386.68,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> also reports Precision, Recall and ERDE scores for UPFA. Regarding ERDE, Table <ref type="table" coords="7,196.75,398.64,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports six different ERDE measures, organised in 3 subsets:</p><p>-ERDE{5,50} challenge: the scores reported by the challenge organisers, considering a late delivery of our results. -ERDE{5,50} chunks: the scores calculated assuming that the results were sent on time for all the chunks. -ERDE{5,50} writings: the scores calculated with the exact number of writings that were analyzed by each model before making a decision.</p><p>The results show that processing the streams dynamically, writing per writing, instead of chunk by chunk, reduces the ERDE value. Also, the Logistic Regression classifiers provided better results compared to the models where Random Forest was applied.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="7,178.28,548.52,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> reports the results after processing each chunk with the dynamic method. Focusing on T1, as more chunks are analyzed, the F1 score increases, and so the precision and recall. The ERDE decreases after analysing the second chunk, and starts to slightly increase afterwards. Regarding ERDE50, the percentage mostly decreases after processing a new chunk. With all chunks processed, we found that the system got the highest amount of true positive cases (47%), right after processing the first chunk, but this is precisely when the highest amount of false positive cases are predicted too (76%).</p><p>Based on the F1 Score, our best model got the fifth place among the 45 models presented for T1 <ref type="bibr" coords="8,246.53,130.95,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Considering the ERDE writings score we can see that our model would have obtained the lowest value for the ERDE50 measure among all the lab results, with a percentage of 6.41%. In this case, we assume that the other models needed to see all the writings of the last chunk from which they made a decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Task 2: Anorexia</head><p>The best model for T2 was UPFC with a F1 Score of 0,73. Regarding ERDE score, UPFD reported the best score for ERDE5 (12.93%) and UPFA for ERDE50 (11.34%). As in T1, Table <ref type="table" coords="8,249.64,305.70,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> displays the ERDE chunks and ERDE writings. We can see that processing the streams writing per writing and Logistic Regression classifiers provided better results.</p><p>From Table <ref type="table" coords="8,203.03,346.89,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> we observe that, even though the recall increases considerably after processing each chunk, the precision seems to remain stable. The ERDE percentages seem to present a similar pattern as for T1. After processing chunk 1, the highest amount of true positives are detected (48%), and again the highest amount of false positive cases are identified (56%).</p><p>Comparing our results with the ones of the models presented by other teams, based on the F1 Score, our best model got the seventh place among the 35 models presented. Taking into account the ERDE writings score, we can see that our model would have obtained the lowest value for the ERDE5 measure among all the lab results, with a percentage of 10.48%. Again, we assume that the other models were designed to see all the writings of the chunk from which they made a decision. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions and further work</head><p>In this paper we proposed several models for the early detection of cases of depression and anorexia, by dynamically processing users' text streams. Different machine learning approaches were designed using features extracted from the texts. These features were based on linguistic information, domain-specific vocabulary, and psychological processes. The models generated have a better performance for predicting anorexia. However, the results obtained have shown that the proposed approaches are suitable for the early detection of both depression and anorexia.</p><p>With the aim to improve our results, new features and learning algorithms will be tested. We plan to try other algorithms such as SVM, Neural Networks and voting methods, as they have been previously applied with promising results <ref type="bibr" coords="9,157.87,435.93,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Features based on the posting time, topics and sentiment analysis are left to be tested. Finally, we will investigate how to avoid the prediction of too many false positives right after processing the first chunk.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,139.42,198.74,333.54,187.73"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Features considered for T1 and T2 in the models delivered.</figDesc><table coords="5,139.42,218.06,333.54,168.40"><row><cell>Feature Type</cell><cell>Details and resources</cell><cell cols="2">Used in T1 Used in T2</cell></row><row><cell>Linguistic and</cell><cell>Depression vocabulary</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>no</cell></row><row><cell>psychological processes,</cell><cell>Anorexia vocabulary</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>yes</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">and depression vocabulary LIWC</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>yes</cell></row><row><cell>N-grams</cell><cell>unigrams</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>yes</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>bigrams</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>yes</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>trigrams</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>no</cell></row><row><cell>Statistical features</cell><cell>number of posts per user</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>no</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>median number of words</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>no</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>per post</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Features with added</cell><cell>Addition of the weighted</cell><cell>yes</cell><cell>no</cell></row><row><cell>weighted scores</cell><cell>scores of depression related</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>features</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Addition of the weighted</cell><cell>no</cell><cell>yes</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>scores of anorexia related</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>features</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
