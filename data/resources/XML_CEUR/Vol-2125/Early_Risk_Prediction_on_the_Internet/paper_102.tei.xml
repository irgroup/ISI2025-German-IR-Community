<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 2018 CLEF eRisk is composed of two tasks: (1) early detection of signs of depression and (2) early detection of signs of anorexia. In this paper, we present the methods we developed when participating to these two tasks. We used two types of representations of the texts: one uses linguistic features and the other uses text vectorization. These representations are combined in different ways in models that are trained using a machine learning approach. These models are then used to built the 5 runs we submitted for task (1) and the 2 runs for task (2), which differences are also detailed in this paper. For task (1), best results were obtained when combining the methods based on features and text vectorization, and for task (2), the method based on text vectorization gives the best results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The CLEF eRisk pilot task aims at detecting early trace of risk on the Internet, especially those related to safety and health. The main goal of eRisk is: "to pioneer a new interdisciplinary research area that would be potentially applicable to a wide variety of situations and to many different personal profiles, such as potential paedophiles, stalkers, individuals with a latent tendency to fall into the hands of criminal organisations, people with suicidal inclinations, or people susceptible to depression" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,250.69,548.00,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>To achieve this goal, the task organizers proposed two exploratory tasks: early risk detection of depression and early risk detection of anorexia <ref type="bibr" coords="1,446.20,572.17,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The challenge is to detect early traces of these diseases in texts published by users in social media.</p><p>This paper describes the participation of the IRIT team at CLEF 2018 eRisk pilot task for early detection of depression and early detection of anorexia. The team submitted 5 runs for the depression task and 2 runs for the anorexia one. These runs as well as the way they have been obtained and results are described in this paper.</p><p>The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a description of the two eRisk pilot tasks. Section 3 details our participation to early detection of signs of depression. Then Section 4 details our participation to early detection of signs of anorexia. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Tasks Description</head><p>For both tasks, the main goal is to detect as soon as possible some signs of changes in texts: signs of depression for task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,333.99,221.81,12.73,8.74" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and signs of anorexia for task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,233.76,11.62,8.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The detection is based on a text collection sorted in a chronological order and divided into 10 chunks <ref type="foot" coords="2,252.44,244.14,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">3</ref> .</p><p>Both tasks were divided into two stages: training stage and testing stage. For both tasks, the training stage began on November 30, 2017, when the two training collections were released. The testing stage began on February 6, 2018, when the chunks 1 of the two test collections were released. Then a new chunk for each task was release every week, until April 10, 2018 when chunks 10 were provided. Every week during the testing stage, participants had to send a run where the system had to make a three-way decision for each user: annotate the user as depressed/anorexic (task (1)/task (2)), annotate the user as non depressed/non anorexic, or wait to see more chunks (i.e. the next chunk of data). As soon as the system annotates a user, this decision could not be changed for future chunks of data, in other word, the decision was final. For chunk 10, systems had to make a decision for each user in the test collection, i.e. the decision for the latest chunk was two-way: annotate the user as depressed/anorexic, or annotate the user as non depressed/non anorexic.</p><p>For the evaluation of systems, a new measure (see Section 2.1) was defined to take into account the correctness of the system decision and the delay taken to emit its decision (i.e. how early in the series of chunks the decision was taken). More details about the characteristics of both tasks can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,434.55,460.91,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Evaluation metric</head><p>For both tasks, an error measure for early risk detection (ERDE) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,432.79,509.93,10.52,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is used. Using this measure, the fewer writings used to make the decision, the better the system.</p><p>The ERDE value of the system is the mean of the ERDE obtained for each user computed with Equation <ref type="formula" coords="2,267.54,557.75,3.87,8.74" target="#formula_0">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,143.36,576.61,337.24,40.12">ERDE o (d, k) =        c f p if d = positive AN D ground truth = negative (F P ) c f n if d = negative AN D ground truth = positive (F N ) lc o (k) • c tp if d = positive AN D ground truth = positive (T P ) 0 if d = negative AN D ground truth = negative (T N )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where: The delay k is the number of writings needed to make the decision.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Dataset</head><p>The dataset of this second edition of eRisk on depression detection is an extension of first edition described in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,258.84,323.74,10.52,8.74" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,271.02,323.74,7.01,8.74" target="#b6">7]</ref>. It is composed of chronological sequences of posts and comments from Reddit<ref type="foot" coords="3,286.19,334.12,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">4</ref> social media platform, for a total of 214 depressed users and a random control group of 1,493 users.</p><p>The construction of the CLEF 2018 eRisk depression dataset is the same as for CLEF 2017 eRisk: the organizers have collected a maximum number of submissions (posts and comments) from any subreddits for each user and the users with fewer than 10 submissions were excluded. In the collection, users are classified as depressed and non depressed. A user is considered as depressed if s/he expresses having been diagnosed with depression in his/her posts/comments such as "I was diagnosed with depression", and then it was manually verified if it was really genuine. These posts/comments that contain self-expressions of depression were discarded from the dataset in order to make a non-trivial detection. On the other hand, users are considered as non depressed if their posts/comments in depression subreddits do not contain any expression of depression. Others users and their posts were also crawled from random subreddits and considered as non depressed. In total, the training dataset contains 135 depressed users and 752 non depressed users, while the test dataset contains 79 depressed users and 741 non depressed users. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,256.08,527.04,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> reports a summary of some characteristics of the training and test datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Additional dataset</head><p>During the training stage, we used an additional dataset to build our models: the Clpsych 2016 dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="3,246.71,601.42,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. We added this other dataset in order to get more information regarding depressed users during the training stage. This dataset is composed of forum posts written between July 2012 and June 2015, where each post is annotated using a semaphore pattern to indicate the level of risk in the text; this dataset is not only depression-related but rather it considers various mental diseases such as Crisis (there is an imminent risk of being harmed, or harming themselves or others), Red (there is a risk and the user needs help as soon as possible), Amber (there is a risk but the user does not need help immediately), and Green (there is no risk).</p><p>As the problem for depression detection is a binary classification (depressed or non-depressed), we changed the Clpsych 2016 dataset annotations as follows: if a post is tagged as Crisis or Red or Amber, the post is annotated as depressed (even if this is another mental trouble) and if a post is tagged as Green, it is considered as non depressed. We used Clpsych 2016 training and test data sets as additional data during the training stage. As results, we get additional data that contains 473 depressed users and 715 non depressed users.</p></div>

We chose these eighteen features for the second model because the combination of these features, among other combinations we tested, gave the best results on the training data. We used Chisquared ranking to rank features and then choose the combinations that used the best ranked features. The two models are built with Random Forest trained with the following parameters: class weight="balanced", max features="sqrt", n estimators=60, min weight fraction leaf=0.0, criterion='entropy', random sta te=2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text vectorization model</head><p>This model is based on text vectorization relying on doc2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="7,413.70,291.20,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to represent user's writings (posts or comments) as a vector. We first compute the vectors for each writing and then average them to get the final vector of the user.</p><p>We trained two separate models, Distributed Bag of Words and Distributed Memory model, as done in <ref type="bibr" coords="7,255.95,343.58,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> on eRisk 2018 training dataset (on depression) and Clpsych 2016 dataset. The output of these two models are concatenated, giving a 200-dimensional vector per text, as done by Trotzek et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,444.40,367.49,15.50,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and recommended by Le and Mikolov <ref type="bibr" coords="7,282.19,379.44,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To avoid unseen vector for a text in eRisk test dataset, we used an inference step that outputs a new text vector without changing the trained models (i.e. all network weights). We call doc2vec train data this concatenation of these two models.</p><p>As above, we trained two other separate vector models but this time on both eRisk 2018 complete dataset (training and test datasets on depression) and Clpsych 2016 dataset. We used the test dataset to avoid unseen vector for a text in the test set and to have a better vector representation of text because all vectors weights are computed from words in both training and test sets which is not the case of an inference step. As the release of test datasets during the eRisk task is done chunk by chunk, and in order to have doc2vec trained on both training and test datasets, we re-trained the two doc2vec models on the training and the part of test sets. The output of these two models are also concatenated, giving a 200-dimensional vector per text. We call doc2vec all data this concatenation of these two models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two models based on text vectorization have been built, namely</head><p>Model doc2vec train data and Model doc2vec all data. Recall that the latter uses the training data and test data available at the time it is run.</p><p>Both models used a logistic regression classifier trained on the vectors of the eRisk 2018 training and Clpsych 2016 datasets, built with doc2vec train data for first model and doc2vec all data for the second. The parameters used during training for both models based on text vectorization are as follows: class weight= "balanced", random state=1, max iter=100, solver="liblinear".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Results</head><p>We submitted five runs: LIIRA, LIIRB, LIIRC, LIIRD and LIIRE. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,475.61,144.50,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref> reports which combinations are used for each run. We can see that in LIIRA run, we first uses Model 58 feat until chunk 2, then we changed to Model 18 feat. LIIRE uses only Model 18 feat. The three other runs are a combination of two models, one based on features and the other based on text vectorization. LIIRC and LIIRB are similar; the difference is the time in chunk they started. Although we experimented the use of doc2vec model only but decided not to use as a run because of its poor results when used alone. Each week (chunk released), these five systems took a decision about each user: he or she is depressed/non depressed; alternatively, the system could wait for more chunks (see section 2). To solve this problem for LIIRA and LIIRE, which are not a combination of two models, we defined a threshold on the prediction confidence scores associated to the system decision on a user. If the confidence score exceeds the set threshold, the user is annotated otherwise the system waits for more chunks. This solution is used to annotate the user as nondepressed while user is annotated as depressed as soon as the system predicts it whatever the the prediction confidence score. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,359.80,462.60,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the evolution of the threshold for both runs according to the chunks.</p><p>For the other three runs LIIRB, LIIRC, and LIIRD, a user is defined as depressed if the two models they are composed of predict that the user is depressed. In other cases, a user is considered as depressed if the model based on text vectorization predicts that the user is depressed, but we consider various threshold on the confidence score depending on the number of documents the model uses: the user will be considered as depressed if the system associates a probability higher than 0.55 when using at least 20 documents written by that user, 0.7 when using 10 documents, and above 0.9 when using more than 200 documents. Reversely, a user is considered as non-depressed if the model based on text vectorization predicts that the user is non-depressed with probabilities below 0.45 when using at least 100 documents, 0.4 when using at least 50 documents, 0.3 with at least 20 documents and all probabilities below 0.1. At chunk 9, users who are not tagged by systems as depressed are considered as non depressed.</p><p>Our results are quite good in terms of ERDE (see section 2.1). LIIRA gives the best ERDE 5 while LIIRE achieved the best Precision and F-measure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>This is the first edition for eRisk on early detection of signs of anorexia. The dataset for this task has the same format as the dataset for the depression detection task described above and the source of data is also the same (Reddit forum).</p><p>In this task, we focus on two kinds of Reddit forum users: those who were diagnosed with anorexia (61 users, 20 users in the training set and 41 in the testing set) and those who are not (control group) (411 users from which 132 are in the training set and 279 users in the testing set). In the collection, each user has a sequence of writings in chronological order. Table <ref type="table" coords="9,378.71,587.13,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_5">6</ref> reports a summary of some basic characteristics of the training and test datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Model</head><p>In this section, we describe the model we used to built the 2 runs we submitted for early detection of anorexia and detail later the differences between the runs. The model is based on text vectorization using doc2vec like for the previous task. Each user is represented by a vector which is the average of the vectors of each writing of that user.</p><p>As for depression detection, we trained two separate models, Distributed Bag of Words and Distributed Memory model, on eRisk 2018 anorexia training dataset. The output of these two models are concatenated, giving a 200dimensional vector per text, as done for depression detection and recommended by the developers of doc2vec <ref type="bibr" coords="10,262.09,322.21,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>A logistic regression classifier was then trained on the 200-dimensional vectors of the training set with the following parameters: class weight="balanced", random state=1, max iter=100, solver="liblinear". We called the model we built Model doc2vec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Results</head><p>We submitted two runs: LIIRA and LIIRB. Both runs are based on the same model Model doc2vec described above. The difference is that LIIRA is used for the first time in chunk 3 while LIIRB in chunk 6.</p><p>For both runs, a user is considered as anorexic if the model predicts that he/she is with a probability higher than 0.55 when using at least 20 documents written by the user, 0.7 when using at least 10 documents, all probabilities above 0.9 when useing more than 200 documents. A user is considered as non anorexic if the model predicts that the user is with a probability below 0.45 and at least 100 documents, 0.4 and at least 50 documents, 0.3 and at least 20 documents, and all probabilities below 0.1. At chunk 7 for LIIRA and chunk 10 for LIIRB, users who are not tagged by the model as anorexic are considered as non anorexic.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="10,177.14,559.82,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_6">7</ref> gives the results we obtained. Among our two runs, LIIRA achieves the best ERDE 5 and Precision while LIIRB achieves the best ERDE 50 , Recall and F-measure. Our results are encouraging although they can be improved.</p><p>Compared to other participants, over the 34 runs, we achieved the fifth Fmeasure, the eighth Precision, the ninth Recall, the eleventh ERDE 5 and the fourteenth ERDE 50 . More details on results can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="10,408.13,620.25,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The best results in the competition are: 11.40% for ERDE 5 , 6.61% for ERDE 50 , 0.85 for F-measure, 0.91 for Precision and 0.88 for Recall. These values are from different runs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented our participation to the CLEF 2018 eRisk for both tasks : (1) early detection of depression signs and (2) early detection of signs of anorexia. We submitted 5 runs for the task (1) and 2 runs for the task (2) that are based on machine learning technique that relies on various linguistic features and/or classifier based on text vectorization. For task (1) we achieved the second Precision, the fifth F-measure, the sixth ERDE 5 and the seventh ERDE 50 ; for task (2) we achieved the fifth F-measure, the eighth Precision, the ninth Recall, the eleventh ERDE 5 and the fourth ERDE 50 .</p><p>For future work, we will analyse the features used for task (1) to get better results and identify those that can be adapted to task <ref type="bibr" coords="11,382.64,367.05,11.62,8.74" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Another direction is to analyse deeply the impact of using the different features in the various tasks in order to know which features are more specific of which risk detection. For example, we could compare the features used in the e-risk challenges and in the TRAC challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="11,229.12,414.87,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>; this latter challenge aims at detecting the existence of aggressiveness in a text <ref type="bibr" coords="11,251.98,426.82,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We would like to complete the features with key phrase representation, following our previous research on this topic <ref type="bibr" coords="11,426.89,438.78,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Finally, we would like to develop a model based on deep learning in order to avoid the feature engineering step and to give insights on how well such approach could capture the discriminating features.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,240.06,131.01,153.80,8.74;3,140.99,143.00,300.38,8.77;3,140.99,155.03,46.39,9.68;3,202.91,153.17,3.97,6.12;3,191.34,160.02,26.62,6.75;3,219.66,155.06,2.77,8.74;3,140.99,167.05,310.14,9.68"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>positive cases in the test collection; d = binary decision for the user taken by the system with delay k; lc o (k) = 1 1+e k-o ; o is a parameter and equal 5 for ERDE 5 and equal 50 for ERDE 50 .</figDesc></figure>
