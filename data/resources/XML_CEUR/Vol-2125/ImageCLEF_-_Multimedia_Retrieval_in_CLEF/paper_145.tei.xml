<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Tuberculosis is still a common disease and the diagnosis of Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is challenging. It is difficult for radiologists to distinguish between MDR and Drug Sensitive (DS) tuberculosis and there is inconsistency in the literature on which radiographic features are useful. For instance, presence of lymph node calcifications is associated with MDR in some papers and with DS in other <ref type="bibr" coords="1,405.46,525.71,7.51,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.97,525.71,3.76,8.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.97,525.71,3.76,8.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.97,525.71,3.76,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,416.72,525.71,7.51,8.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The main objective of the ImageCLEF tuberculosis task is to provide tuberculosis severity scores based on automatic analysis of lung CT images of patients. Being able to extract this information from image data alone can allow for more limited lung washing and laboratory analyses to determine tuberculosis type and drug resistances. This can lead to quicker decisions on best treatment strategies, reduced use of antibiotics, and lower impact on patients. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,200.82,597.71,11.32,8.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Table  As reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.22,278.25,10.82,8.96" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,247.37,278.25,7.26,8.96" target="#b7">8]</ref>, patients with MDR tuberculosis were younger, mean age 43.6 ±17.17SD vs 50.7 ±18, applying the Student's t-test for two samples, this difference was significant with p&lt;0.002. See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,334.39,302.25,3.77,8.96">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1. Age comparison between MDR and DS patients</head><p>Our approach for this task was to use a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) on reformatted coronal png images. We chose a pretrained CNN due to the relative small number of cases. To increase the number of instances to train the CNN, instead of processing all images of a patient as a single case, each reconstructed image was treated as a separate case during training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Preprocessing</head><p>The images for the ImageCLEF tuberculosis task were provided as NIfTI 3D datasets. We used med2image, a Python3 utility that converts medical image formatted files to more visual friendly ones, such as png and jpg, to convert the images. After reconstructing them in all 3 planes, we decided to use them in the coronal plane to have more images containing areas of abnormal lung. Although we did not visually verify the images of this data set, tuberculosis usually involves the upper lobes with relative sparing of the lung bases. As a result, axial images through the lung bases could possibly be normal even in patient with severe disease in the upper lobes, so we chose to use the coronal plane since a larger proportion of images should contain abnormal areas. As med2image did not take in consideration slice thickness, the reconstructed coronal images were deformed and of different height. To correct this problem all images were resized to a 512 x 512 matrix. Image masks for the lungs were available, but were not used. To exclude chest walls and still include a significant portion of the lungs, of the 512 coronal images obtained for each patient only images 150 to 350 were utilized for trainingimage 150 was the most posterior and 350 the most anterior image utilized.</p><p>All image equalization and data augmentation was done at the time of the training using the fastai library <ref type="bibr" coords="3,192.65,294.21,10.69,8.96" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Neural Network Training</head><p>For training of the CNN, we rented from Paperport a cloud virtual machine with 8 CPUs, Quadro P5000 GPU, 30 GB RAM, and 500 GB solid state drive created using the fast.ai public template. We took advantage of the fastai library to perform transfer training of ResNext 50 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,218.57,380.25,16.72,8.96" target="#b9">[10]</ref> convolutional neural network.</p><p>For training the CNN an image size of 64 x 64 was utilized. The learning rate was determined after running the learning rate finder function and plotting the learning rate vs. loss. See Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,204.65,428.25,3.77,8.96">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. LEARNING RATE VS. LOSS</head><p>After reviewing this curve, a learning rate of 0.002 was selected for the last layers. The last layers were trained for 2 epochs without data augmentation, then were trained for 2 additional epochs using data augmentation. For data augmentation, we used random rotations of up to 10 degrees in each direction, random changes of intensity of up to 5%, and random horizontal flipping (but no vertical flipping) based on the assumption that right and left lung are similar, but upper and lower lobes are different. Subsequently all layers were unfrozen and trained for an additional 3 epochs using a different learning rate for different layers. The final layer learning rate was kept at 0.002, but the learning rate for the middle layers was one third of the last layers and the initial layers learning rate was one ninth of the last layers. Same augmentation used at training time was also used at test time, and the average of 4 augmented images was used for each test image.</p><p>As we had analyzed each image separately, we had 200 different results for each patient, so we averaged the results of the 200 images of each patient. As expected, using the average decreased the probability of MDR tuberculosis as some of the images were including only normal or less abnormal lungs. As the number of patients with MDR was known, the probability was manually rescaled in Microsoft Excel before submission to provide the correct number of positive and negative MDR cases and to use the entire probability range from 0 to 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>When each image is scored individually, patients with MDR tuberculosis have a significant number of images scored as not MDR tuberculosis. This can be explained by the fact that significant pathology necessary to make the diagnosis of MDR tuberculosis may not be present in all images.</p><p>In the final table of results, the submitted run for MDR detection task was ranked first for accuracy among the 39 submitted runs with a prediction accuracy of 0.6144 and second for area under ROC-curve (AUC) equal 0.6114 on the test image dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="4,455.21,506.27,11.45,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The best result in terms of AUC value was achieved by VISTA@UEvora team and resulted in AUC = 0.6178. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the Results</head><p>Although we achieved the best accuracy and second-best AUC, to be clinically useful automatic detection of MDR need to further improve. Accuracy and AUC in the 0.61 range cannot be relied upon by the treating physician.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Perspectives for Future work</head><p>Due to the competition's time contrains, several shortcuts were implemented: arbitrary selection of coronal images 150 to 350, conversion of images to png format, averaging results of single slices of each patient. A better selection of images containing the lungs or even better, the abnormal portion of the lungs/mediastinum, may improve results. Using Hounsfield units from the original images, instead of values in the png files may also be more accurate. Instead of averaging the results of single images and rescaling the results, utilizing a more robust approach to combining results from multiple images from the same patient may also helppossibilities to consider include using an SVM <ref type="bibr" coords="6,177.19,366.21,21.98,8.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or an RNN <ref type="bibr" coords="6,248.09,366.21,15.43,8.96" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented the use of transfer learning to quickly train a CNN to achieve the best accuracy and second-best AUC at the ImageCLEF 2018 Tuberculosis -MDR detection task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,211.11,447.23,11.33,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.
