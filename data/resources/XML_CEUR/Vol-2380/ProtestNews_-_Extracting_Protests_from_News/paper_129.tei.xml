<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Social science studies can benefit from analyzing and comparing protest event information from multiple countries to understand the reasons behind certain social dynamics such as emerging welfare regimes. Although, online mass media agencies report the major incidents as soon as in a day, manually collecting such amounts of data is time-taking, expensive and hard to maintain. Automating the process with natural language processing (NLP) allows us to harness such information on a large scale with a high speed.</p><p>Many recent state-of-the-art NLP approaches are based on supervised machine learning technique where the machine discovers patterns on manually prepared gold-standard data to learn how to detect relevant information. With the recent developments, it is possible to teach information extraction models to detect information that has similar patterns to the training data at reasonable levels. However, generating a model that can correctly recognize relevant data with never-observed patterns is relatively a challenging task. Generalizability of a model especially affects the results when used on cross-cultural text. Even though the text is written in the same language on the model trained, the cultural differences can affect the context and the language usage such as the word choices and ordering. This issue can cause semantic bias <ref type="bibr" coords="2,380.77,238.55,11.44,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, potentially neglect the model, render it useless, and thus, eventually force us to generate models specific to cultures and regions.</p><p>CLEF organizers prepared the ProtestNews Task 3:Event information extraction shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="2,203.51,286.61,16.14,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, stressing both the importance of automatically extracting protest event information from news and the impact of the generalizability in natural language processing applications. The aim of the shared task is to develop generalizable NLP tools that is robust enough to be used regardless of their data source with a focus on detecting and extracting relevant information on protest news.</p><p>We design a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Residual Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers with pretrained Embeddings for Language Models (ELMo) word embeddings <ref type="bibr" coords="2,321.09,382.49,18.99,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and a classical Conditional Random Fields (CRF) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,209.92,394.44,19.68,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> based machine learning model. We accept the CRF based model as a strong baseline and compare both the performances and the generalizabilities of two models. We display a contrast between one of the classical machine learning approaches and one of the latest methods as well as we aim for this automation to be as accurate as possible, knowing that our methods will probably not be as precise as human annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Information Extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text and studied as part of the natural language processing area <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.56,536.33,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Previous studies demonstrated that end-to-end information extraction systems can be developed to analyze news media data by employing probabilistic approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,243.72,560.24,15.50,8.74" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,260.88,560.24,11.62,8.74" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In the ProtestNews shared task, the event information extraction is designed as an entity sequence labelling task. The goal of the sequence labelling can be described as labelling the sequences of relevant words in text by a single categorical class.</p><p>A classical machine learning framework for labelling sequential data is Linearchain Conditional Random Fields <ref type="bibr" coords="2,281.51,620.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. CRF prevents the label bias problem that occurs when there is an uncertainty in the previous tag of the sequence <ref type="bibr" coords="2,442.37,632.21,14.61,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The strength of the CRF is also coming from the ability of dealing with the arbitrary, overlapping features of the input <ref type="bibr" coords="2,279.19,656.12,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. CRF is accepted as one of the state-of-the-art approaches and CRF-based models are applied to sequence labelling tasks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,463.93,118.99,16.65,8.74" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,134.77,130.95,7.75,8.74" target="#b7">8]</ref> including some of the state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools <ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.51,130.95,11.37,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>In the recent years, studies have shown promise with Recurrent Neural Networks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.52,154.86,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Long-Short Term Memories (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,344.18,154.86,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> based RNNs can learn temporal dependence between the sequences and also when to forget them. Moreover, Bidirectional LSTM <ref type="bibr" coords="3,224.95,178.77,15.50,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref> based networks are reading the data once from the beginning to the end and once from the end to the beginning and this making them learn stronger relations. Furthermore, neural networks started to be used in feature extraction to generate word representation that is effective in supervised sequence labelling problems <ref type="bibr" coords="3,260.17,226.59,14.61,8.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In common state-of-the-art approaches, word representations are generated over individual tokens <ref type="bibr" coords="3,369.62,238.55,14.61,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. ELMo <ref type="bibr" coords="3,423.17,238.55,15.50,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is one of the recent and state-of-the-art word representation network that generates embeddings over the entire word sequences instead of individual tokens, providing an advantage in sequence based tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methods</head><p>Hereunder, we describe the two models we trained for the task and evaluation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Conditional Random Fields Algorithm</head><p>We employ Conditional Random Fields by using the Python binding of CRF-Suite library <ref type="bibr" coords="4,192.23,493.76,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The CRF model is trained on the given training data and the hyperparameters are optimized on the given development set by using Random Search method <ref type="bibr" coords="4,203.65,517.67,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, especially to optimize the regularization parameters known as "C" parameters.</p><p>In classical supervised machine learning, the features have a great impact on the classification accuracy. For the feature extraction, we use a sliding window with a length of 5 tokens meaning that if we are extracting features of a token at position i, the sliding window will contain token i-2 , token i-1 , token i , token i+1 , and token i+2 . Besides getting the features of individual tokens in the sliding window independently, we also include bi-grams and tri-grams of the tokens and most of the features.</p><p>The features extracted to train the CRF model is as listed below;</p><p>-Context: Token of the focus and its surroundings in a sliding window and n-gram combinations.</p><p>-Lemmas: Lemmatized version of the focus and its surroundings in a sliding window and n-gram combinations, obtained by using spaCy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,416.18,130.95,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> NLP tool. -Orthographic Types: The orthographic types of the tokens in a sliding window and n-gram combinations. -Part-of-Speech: Part-of-speech tags of the tokens in a sliding window and n-gram combinations, obtained by using spaCy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,360.56,178.59,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> NLP tool. -Temporal Tags: Temporal tags of the tokens in a sliding window and n-gram combinations, obtained by using HeidelTime temporal tagging tool <ref type="bibr" coords="5,447.39,202.42,14.61,8.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. -Named Entities: Named entity tags of the tokens in a sliding window and n-gram combinations, obtained by using spaCy <ref type="bibr" coords="5,360.56,226.24,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref> NLP tool. -isCapital: A boolean value indicates whether the first letter of the token i is capitalised or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Recurrent Neural Network Approach</head><p>We propose a Recurrent Neural Network architecture briefly consists of the ELMo word embeddings network, two residual BiLSTM layers and a time distributed dense layer with softmax activation at the end, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,134.77,335.04,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. We use the ELMo network pretrained on 1 Billion Word Benchmark <ref type="bibr" coords="5,450.77,589.90,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and distributed in Tensorflow Hub 1 . Thus, ELMo is left out in our training process and used only as a feature extraction layer. ELMo embeddings are generated over the entire word sequences, unlike the other popular embeddings. Consequently the input layer of our network requires tokenized sentences as sequences. We set ELMo to return word embeddings of 1024 dimensions for an inputted sentence sequence. Then, the embeddings are fed to the residually connected BiLSTM layers, each with 512 units and 0.2 dropout rate.</p><p>We use Adam optimizer with the learning rate of 0.001 to find the global minimum for the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. We observe the relation between epochs and training and validation losses. Thus, we initially train our network for 30 epochs. After the 10 th epoch, however, we do not observe any difference in the validation accuracy. The learning rate, dropout rate, units, and dimensions are decided heuristically.</p><p>Implementation of the network and the loss function is done in Keras (v2.2.4) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,134.77,238.84,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> with the Tensorflow (v1.14.1) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,280.13,238.84,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> back-end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation of the algorithms are done in the submission platform of the ProtestNews shared task <ref type="bibr" coords="6,246.72,302.07,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The evaluation metrics used are precision, recall and f1-score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head><p>On the primary test set, we observe a macro average f1-score of 37.64 with CRF-based model and 55.75 with RNN model, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,429.77,383.23,3.87,8.74">4</ref>. However, we also see that CRF displays a higher precision score than RNN while RNN outperforms CRF model on the recall. Thus, RNN model displays a more balanced performance than CRF. On the secondary test set, the performance of CRF model significantly drops and RNN shows dominance over CRF at each scoring.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,196.65,455.11,3.87,8.74">5</ref>, we observe that both of the models has a performance loss when tested on the secondary model. We see that the performance decrease of the CRF based method is highly visible on the second test set. However, RNN based method compensate this performance drop better.</p><p>As an overall, our best performing model gives 55.75 f1-score on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this study we have proposed a Recurrent Neural Network based approach to extract information on protest news. Furthermore, we have built a classical Conditional Random Fields as our strong baseline to display a contrast between a classical machine learning approach and a more recent method both in performance and in generalizability.</p><p>We have seen that the Recurrent Neural Network based model significantly outperforms Conditional Random Fields based approach both in the primary set and the secondary set. On a setup to test generalizability of each model, we have shown that the CRF based model demonstrates our initial claims with Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="7,153.45,446.13,3.87,8.74">4</ref>: Results of proposed methods on both test sets.
