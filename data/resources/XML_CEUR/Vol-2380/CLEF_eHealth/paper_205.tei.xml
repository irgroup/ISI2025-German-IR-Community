<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper, we describe the participation of the Information Management Systems (IMS) group at CLEF eHealth 2019 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,340.66,466.40,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Technology Assisted Review Task <ref type="bibr" coords="1,159.68,478.36,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This task focuses on the problem of systematic reviews, that is the process of collecting articles that summarise all evidence (if possible) that has been published regarding a certain medical topic. This task requires long search sessions by experts in the field of medicine; for this reason, semi-automatic approaches are essential to support these type of searches when the amount of data exceed the limits of users, i.e. in terms of attention or patience.</p><p>The objective of our participation was to compare the system that we used in the previous year, with a new strategy to distribute the effort of the user (the physician or an expert in the field of medicine) across the topics. In particular, we re-use the stopping strategy to simulate the maximum amount of documents that a physician is willing to review in the two-dimensional approach presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="1,207.96,615.86,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>;</p><p>we distribute the effort, in terms of number of documents to read, proportionally to the size of the pool of documents for each topic; we estimate the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of relevant documents present in the collection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.55,154.89,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The source code of the experiments is available for reproducibility purposes. 3   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>In this paper, we continue to investigate the interaction with the two dimensional interpretation of the BM25 model applied to the problem of explicit relevance feedback <ref type="bibr" coords="2,175.45,254.98,10.51,8.74" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,187.62,254.98,7.75,8.74" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,197.03,254.98,7.75,8.74" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,206.45,254.98,7.75,8.74" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,215.85,254.98,7.75,8.74" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.26,254.98,7.01,8.74" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, the two-dimensional representation of probabilities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,436.48,266.97,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,448.66,266.97,7.75,8.74" target="#b8">9]</ref> is an intuitive way of presenting a two-class classification problem on a two-dimensional space. Given two classes, for example relvant R and non-relevant N R, a document d is assigned to category R if the following inequality holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,251.98,324.82,228.61,23.80">P (d|N R) y &lt; m P (d|R) x +q<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P (d|R) and P (d|N R) are the likelihoods of the object d given the two categories, while m and q are two parameters that can be optimized to compensate for either the unbalanced class issues or different misclassification costs. We focused on the following problems:</p><p>1. study the effectiveness of a classifier given a fixed amount of documents that a physician is willing to review; 2. design a sampling strategy to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the number of relevant documents in the collection.</p><p>In the experiments, we used the same procedure we used lst year <ref type="bibr" coords="2,421.58,473.22,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>:</p><p>we set a number n of documents that the physician is willing to read and a number s that tells the algorithm when (every s documents) to randomly sample a document from the collection instead of presenting to the physician the next most relevant document; for each topic, we run an optimized (hyper-parameters) BM25 retrieval model and we obtain the relevance feedback for the first abstract in the ranking list; from the second document until n/2-1, we continuously update the relevance weights of the terms according to the explicit relevance feedback given by the physician (simulated by the qrels available with the test collection); for the last half of the documents n/2 that the physician is willing to read, we use a Naïve Bayes classifier continuously updated with the explicit relevance feedback <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.39,636.85,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="3,238.91,469.28,3.87,8.74">1</ref>: Proportion of documents per topic.</p><p>Instead of setting n equal for all topics, this year we tried a different approach in order to let the user to read more documents for those topics with more documents in the pool. In Table <ref type="table" coords="3,287.78,541.57,3.87,8.74">1</ref>, we show, for each topic, the number of documents in the pool, the proportion of documents of the pool compared to the total number of documents pooled, the number of documents we will show to the user (to be multiplied by 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>For all the experiments, we set the values of the BM25 hyper-parameters in the same way we did in <ref type="bibr" coords="3,223.37,656.12,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Official Runs</head><p>We submitted runs for three different systems:</p><p>a BM25 baseline with continuous active learning and a fixed threshold for each topic, the "frozen" system fo 2018 with different proportions of documents to be read for the initial phase but with a fixed threshold for each topic, the new approach with a different threshold for each topic.</p><p>In particular, for the frozen system, we used 10% or 50% of the initial pool of documents per topic to build the classifier. The new distributed effort approach uses 10% of the pool at the beginning of the training, but, in general, it may stop earlier compared to the other approach if the effort required for a topic is low in terms of documents allowed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Unofficial Runs</head><p>In order to compare the BM25 model with a similar proportion of documents shown to the user, we added some BM25 runs and removed some others that showed a different number of documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Evaluation Measures</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of the systems, we chose the number of documents shown to the user as one of the performance measures since, in our case, it is also the point where we stop retrieving documents. In addition, we use recall and averaged recall across topics to measure the accuracy of the retrieval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Results</head><p>In Figures <ref type="figure" coords="4,180.90,488.52,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" coords="4,206.89,488.52,3.87,8.74">2</ref>, we show a topic by topic comparison of groups of runs: BM25, distributed effort, orginal 2018 with 10% or 50% of the initial pool selected. By increasing the threshold of the number of documents shown to the user, we are able to tune the performance of the system and reach an average recall close to 100% for all the systems under evaluation. Some topics are much more difficult than others; for example, topic CD011558 requires the retrieval of most of the pooled documents in order to achieve a reasonable recall (around 0.8).</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,193.58,572.32,3.87,8.74">3</ref>, we show the performance of the four groups of runs in terms of average recall (across topics) given the number of documents shown to the user. By increasing the number of documents (from left to right) the four approaches increase the average recall and go beyond 90% even with less than 4% of the total number of documents, for example the two 2018 approaches of the frozen system.</p><p>The distributed effort approach we proposed this year performed worse than expected. It seems that by reducing the number of documents allowed per topic too much, especially for topics with smaller pools, we obtain a suboptimal system compared to the original one. In other terms, it may be more convenient to set up a fixed cost per topic and use all the documents of the pool if necessary, instead of saving some resources for topics with more documents in the pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we presented a variation of the continuous active learning approach used in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,168.38,228.79,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that uses a fixed stopping strategy to simulate the maximum amount of documents that a physician is willing to review and a sampling strategy that is used to estimate the number of relevant documents in the collection. The result of the distributed effort approach were worse than expected, compared to the original approach in presented in 2018. The performance of the new system is still remarkable since it achieves an average recall of 90% by using only 10% of the documents in the collection; however, the original system can achieve the same results by reducing the number of documents shown to the user by half.</p><p>We are currently analyzing the results provided by the organizers and adding to the official runs a set of unofficial runs that will complete the picture of all the possible settings. As future work, we will study a methodology to dynamically vary the amount of documents according to the estimate of the amount of relevant documents still missing.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,145.60,313.06,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,266.31,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,219.56,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,172.81,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,126.05,10.18,4.84;7,144.26,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,151.59,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,158.91,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,166.23,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,173.56,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,180.88,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,188.20,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,195.53,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,202.85,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,210.17,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,217.50,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,224.82,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,232.14,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,239.47,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,246.79,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,254.11,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,261.44,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,268.76,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,276.08,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,283.41,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,290.73,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,298.05,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,305.38,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,312.70,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,320.02,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,327.35,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,334.67,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,341.99,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,349.32,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,356.64,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,363.96,329.82,20.45,17.67;7,266.14,350.13,13.50,5.91;7,137.95,213.80,5.91,15.27;7,396.69,182.39,9.33,5.91;7,409.92,194.04,63.10,4.84;7,409.92,204.09,63.10,4.84;7,409.92,214.13,63.10,4.84;7,409.92,224.17,63.10,4.84;7,409.92,234.22,66.01,4.84;7,409.92,244.26,66.01,4.84;7,409.92,254.30,66.01,4.84;7,244.45,364.90,129.52,7.86;7,145.60,582.50,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,535.75,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,488.99,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,442.24,10.18,4.84;7,145.60,395.49,10.18,4.84;7,144.19,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,151.41,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,158.63,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,165.84,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,173.05,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,180.27,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,187.48,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,194.70,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,201.91,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,209.12,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,216.34,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,223.55,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,230.77,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,237.98,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,245.20,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,252.41,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,259.62,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,266.84,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,274.05,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,281.27,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,288.48,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,295.69,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,302.91,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,310.13,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,317.34,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,324.55,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,331.76,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,338.98,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,346.20,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,353.41,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,360.62,599.26,20.45,17.67;7,264.44,619.56,13.50,5.91;7,137.95,483.23,5.91,15.27;7,393.29,451.83,9.33,5.91;7,406.51,463.48,66.62,4.84;7,406.51,473.52,66.62,4.84;7,406.51,483.57,66.62,4.84;7,406.51,493.61,66.62,4.84;7,406.51,503.65,66.62,4.84;7,406.51,513.70,69.53,4.84;7,406.51,523.74,69.53,4.84;7,222.07,634.33,174.29,7.86"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Topic by topic distributed effort results</figDesc></figure>
