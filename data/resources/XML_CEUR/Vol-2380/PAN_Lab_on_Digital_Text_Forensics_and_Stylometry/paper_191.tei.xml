<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper describes our participation for the Bots and Gender Profiling task at PAN 2019 1 . The aim of this task is to first classify a profile either as bot or human. If the profile is written by a human, it should be further classified as male or female. Our proposed approach is based on language independent stylometry features. A total of 27 language independent stylometry features (18 are character-based features and remaining 9 are emotion-based features) are used to build the system for Bots and Gender Profiling task. On training dataset, for English language, Accuracy scores of 0.97 and 0.80 are obtained for bot and human classification task and male / female classification task respectively. For Spanish language, Accuracy of 0.93 and 0.75 is obtained for bot and human classification task and male / female classification task respectively. On test dataset 1, for English language, Accuracy scores of 0.92 and 0.76 are obtained for bot and human classification task and male / female classification task. For Spanish language, Accuracy of 0.86 and 0.75 is obtained for bot and human classification task and male / female classification task respectively. On test dataset 2, for English language, bot and human classification task and male/female classification task obtained Accuracy scores of 0.92 and 0.76 respectively, whereas for Spanish language, bot and human classification task and male/female classification task obtained Accuracy scores of 0.88 and 0.72 respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As the usage of social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs and community forums is arising, the communication methods are changing. People feel free to talk, discuss and post their reviews, comments on such channels more frequently. Many people rely on social forums i.e. Reddit, Yelp, Quora and Amazon message boards, etc., to get information, feedback and recommendations for different products and services. However, a large number of users on social networking sites are taking miss-advantage of such forums by making fake profiles, spams and bots. In recent years, bots are being used to pose as humans on social networking platforms to influence other social media users with ideological, political or commercial purposes. Bots can exaggerate the popularity of products by writing positive reviews and rating them. They can also sabotage the reputation of competitive products through negative reviews and ratings. Furthermore, bots are also being widely used for fake news spreading. Therefore, it is important to develop author profiling systems which can discriminate bot profiles from human ones.</p><p>The study presents a stylometry-based approach to address the problem of Bots and Gender Profiling. A total of 27 language independent features are used, which can be broadly categorized into: (1) character-based features and (2) emotions-based features. A range of classifiers have been applied including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear SVC, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB and SVC (Support Vector Classifier) to train and test our proposed system. The developed system is deployed on TIRA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,127.60,429.65,11.69,9.19" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for final evaluation on test datasets. A detailed comparison of all the systems presented in the PAN 2019 Bot and Gender Profiling task can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,412.55,442.37,15.35,9.19" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work on author profiling, Section 3 presents our proposed approach, Section 4 describes the experimental setup, Section 5 presents results and their analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with future work directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In previous studies, many researchers have explored different methods i.e. stylometry-based, content-based, topic-based, emotion-based and deep learning for finding different demographics of an author on social media. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,354.19,564.53,10.64,9.19" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the authors have applied stylometry-based approach for cross-genre author profiling. Their set of stylometrybased features included 6 vocabulary richness features, 26 character-based features, 16 syntactic features and 7 lexical features. Promising results were obtained using their proposed set of stylometry-based features (Accuracy of 0.576 for gender classification, 0.371 for age classification and 0.256 for combined classification of age and gender).</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,150.06,646.85,10.64,9.19" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors have classified the humans and bots by learning tweets patterns and then further categorized bots in to classes i.e. spam bots, consumption and broadcast bots. They proposed a new profiling framework that consists of entropy-based features such as timings of tweets, hashtags, URL's and followers count etc. The author worked on nearly 159 thousand bots and human data on Twitter. The experiments results show efficient results on malicious and benign bots to find the interesting behavior traits. In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,160.79,175.25,15.34,9.19" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, authors have investigated content-based features (word and character ngrams) and 64 stylometry-based features (11 lexical word-based, 47 lexical characterbased and 6 vocabulary measures) for the identification of gender and age traits on multilingual corpora.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.94,232.13,15.34,9.19" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the authors have focused on instance-based, prototype based and distancebased classification strategy. They have extracted different features i.e. frequency of negative and positive emoticons, mark of retweets, no of hashtags and part of speech tags for the identification gender and language task.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.91,288.77,10.64,9.19" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the authors have detected bots from Wikidata by extracting comment-based features of user. The comments-based features help to examine the editing behavior of registered and non-registered users. The author used the random forest classifier and a gradient boosting classifier and applied optimization by hyper parameter for both models. The performance of model is efficient against the registered user information.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.20,358.37,15.34,9.19" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors have used image and text-based combined features for gender identification. They have represented text using bag of terms (BoT) model and for CNN model for image representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Language Independent Stylometry-based Approach</head><p>Writing style of an author helps to identify various attributes of an author, for example, age, gender, personality type, occupation and political interest etc. It is expected that the writing style of a human is significantly different from a bot. Therefore, stylometry features <ref type="bibr" coords="3,193.62,461.81,16.69,9.19" target="#b12">[13]</ref> are likely to be very helpful in discriminating bot profiles from human ones. Another major difference between a human profile and a bot profile is the usage of emotions. The profile generated by a bot is likely to be plain text, whereas on the other hand, a human profile is likely to be a mixture of both text and emotions. Considering the above two factors, our proposed approach uses a combination of character-based stylometry features and emotions-based features to distinguish human from bot. Note that our proposed approach uses language independent stylometry features i.e. they can be applied on any language for bot and human profiling. In our proposed system, a total of 27 stylometry-based features are used (18 features are character-based and 9 are emotion-based). The set of character-based features includes: (1) url_count, (2) space_count, (3) capital_count, (4) text_length, (5) curly_brackets_count, (6) round_brackets_count, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,334.07,607.49,11.69,9.19" target="#b6">(7)</ref> underscore_count, (8) ques-tion_mark_count, (9) exclamation_mark_count, (10) dollar_mark_count, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,422.21,620.21,16.69,9.19" target="#b10">(11)</ref> amper-sand_mark_count, (12) hash_count, (13) tag_count, (14) slashes_count, (15) opera-tor_count, (16) punc_count, (17) line_count, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,312.55,645.65,16.69,9.19" target="#b17">(18)</ref> word_count. The set of emotionbased features includes: (1) emoji_count, (2) face_smiling, (3) face_affection, (4) face_tongue, (5) face_hand, (6) face_neutral_skeptical, (7) face_concerned, (8) mon-key_face, (9) emotions (for details see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,305.84,683.81,3.67,9.19" target="#tab_0">3</ref>.1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head><p>This section describes the main statistics of the training corpus, evaluation methodology and evaluation measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Training Corpus</head><p>We used PAN19-author-profiling-training dataset to train our proposed system. We have performed author profiling task for both languages i.e. English and Spanish. The English training corpus contains 4,120 author profiles and each profile contains 100 tweets in English, whereas Spanish training corpus contains 3,000 author profiles and each profile consists of 100 tweets in Spanish (see Table <ref type="table" coords="6,359.41,269.57,4.18,9.19" target="#tab_1">4</ref>.1 for detailed statistics of both corpora). Note that, in our proposed approach, no pre-processing or cleaning operations were performed on both training and test datasets because URL's and hashtags were used as features in the classification task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Methodology</head><p>The tasks of predicting an author's type as bot or human and determining gender from his/her text are treated as supervised document classification tasks. We performed binary classification tasks for distinguishing bot from human and then identification of its gender. A range of classifiers were explored including Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier, LinearSVC, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB and SVC to train and test our proposed system. The numeric values generated by the 27 stylometry features (see Section 3) were used as input to these classifiers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluation Measure</head><p>Evaluation is carried out using Accuracy measure. Accuracy is defined as ratio of correctly predicted profiles to total number of profiles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Results on Training Dataset</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,165.05,591.41,4.18,9.19" target="#tab_2">5</ref>.1 presents the Accuracy results of our proposed approach on PAN19-author-profiling-training dataset using 6 different machine learning algorithms. The best results are obtained using Random Forest classifier for both English (0.970 Accuracy for bot/human &amp; 0.802 for gender prediction) and Spanish (0.935 Accuracy for bot/human &amp; 0.755 for gender prediction) languages. As can be noted that these results are very promising, highlighting the fact that language independent character-based, and emotion-based features used in our proposed approach are useful in discriminating a bot from human as well as distinguishing a male profile from a female one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results on Test Datasets</head><p>In PAN 2019 Bot and Gender Profiling task, final evaluation is carried out on two test corpora: (1) PAN19-author-profiling-test-dataset1 corpus and (2) PAN19-authorprofiling-test-dataset2 corpus. Table <ref type="table" coords="7,277.64,507.89,4.18,9.19" target="#tab_2">5</ref>.2 shows results obtained using our proposed language independent stylometry-based approach on both test corpora. On PAN19-author-profiling-test-dataset1 corpus, for English language, Accuracy scores of 0.9280 and 0.7652 are obtained for bot/human and male/female classification tasks respectively, whereas for Spanish language, 0.8611 and 0.7556 Accuracy scores are obtained for human/bot and male/female classification tasks respectively. Similarly, on PAN19author-profiling-test-dataset2 corpus, for English language, Accuracy scores of 0.9227 and 0.7583 are obtained for bot/human and male/female classification tasks respectively, whereas for Spanish language, 0.8839 and 0.7261 Accuracy scores are obtained for human/bot and male/female classification tasks respectively.</p><p>It can be noted that Accuracy results for English tweets are higher compared to Spanish, even though same language independent features are extracted for both languages. The possible reason for this is that Spanish profiles in the train and test one language since the datasets provided by the PAN organizers contain raw tweets and re-tweets i.e. no pre-processing and / or cleaning is performed. Consequently, performance drops for the Spanish language. These results also show that the Accuracy for the identification of type i.e. human/bot is very high compared to gender prediction which shows that our proposed stylistic features are more suitable for discriminating bot from human than gender discrimination. This is likely to happen because bots are likely to generate profiles without emotions and humans generate profiles with a combination of emotions and texts. Consequently, it makes it easier for the classifiers to distinguish human from bot.</p></div>
