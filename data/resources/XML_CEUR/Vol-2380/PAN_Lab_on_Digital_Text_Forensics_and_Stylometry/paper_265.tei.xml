<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The popularity of social media raises a concern about the quality of content over its platforms. The quality of data is important, especially for fair and considerable predictive analysis. If the quality of data is less, it may result in the prediction of wrong circumstances of an event. This causes misleading trending problems and more importantly, the sensitive stock price may fluctuate. The contents available on social media can be corrupted and overflowed by bots. There are a variety of bots available such as Spam Bots, Influence Bots, etc. Our target is to identify such bots on Twitter. Twitter data is mostly used by data analysts for applications related to scientific predictions or opinion analysis. This working note is capitalized on earlier approaches and Machine Learning (ML) approaches used to classify between a bot and human and find the gender further for interesting studies in crime detection etc. By sharing many attributes for user profiles, we have identified the pattern to find out that the given user is a bot or human based on the tweets posted.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Before we dive into the proposed methodology used for solving the Bot and Gender identification task, let us have a look at why Author Profiling is needed and its effects on society. We will go through the background of Twitter and see how bots and fake accounts have an adverse impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background of Twitter</head><p>Twitter is a social networking service which was originated in America and serves as an online news portal. It provides users to post messages (tweets) and also to interact privately with another user. A tweet was limited to only 140 characters until November 7, 2017. This limit was doubled for almost all popular languages on Twitter from then. Twitter provides features like post, like, and retweet a tweet for any registered user, while those unregistered can only read. Twitter can be accessed through the web and an application is provided for the convenience of smartphone users. Twitter, Inc. has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, and spreads across the world with more than 25 offices <ref type="bibr" coords="2,195.59,155.18,10.58,8.64">[4]</ref>. Twitter took birth in March 2006 and Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, Evan Williams were the ones who came up with this revolutionary platform <ref type="bibr" coords="2,466.48,167.13,10.58,8.64" target="#b3">[5]</ref>. It gained popularity within no time since its launch in July of that year. By 2012, around 1.6 billion search queries per day were handled by Twitter with more than 100 million users posting around 340 million tweets a day. As of 2016, the monthly active users count raised to more than 319 million. With debates and news covering politics of the United States, it has been a hot-bed ever since 2015. Twitter was the largest source of breaking news on the day of the U.S. presidential election. Around 40 million tweets were sent by 10:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day regarding the elections. It provided the information on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.23,262.77,11.62,8.64" target="#b0">[1]</ref> [9] and the 2018 midterm elections of the United States <ref type="bibr" coords="2,290.28,274.73,10.58,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Impact of Bots on Twitter</head><p>Nowadays the presence of bots over Twitter has increased rapidly. Even though Twitter has anti-spam policies, the bots can bypass them easily. Bots are easy to implement by anyone who has basic knowledge on that domain. Some bots react to a particular keyword which is more likely related to a trending topic. Some bots randomly tweet predefined statements or phrases. In some other cases, the bots are designed to highlight a popular entity like an anime character, historic icon, celebrity characters, etc based on the popular phrases related to the fields. In addition to them, some bots are not fully automated (in other words we can say fake accounts). According to studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.50,410.32,15.27,8.64" target="#b16">[18]</ref>, around 7 of the followers of a Twitter account are fake. Some studies <ref type="bibr" coords="2,413.63,422.28,15.27,8.64" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, though less scientific put that number as high as 35 percent. To solve all these problems Twitter has sued suppliers of fake accounts to shut down them.</p><p>Recently some politicians have been accused of buying influence on social media. These are a few popular Japanese bots used for authorized purposes <ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.02,470.31,10.79,8.64" target="#b2">[3]</ref>:</p><p>-Snoopy (@SNOOPYbot) -Nagato FakeBot (@NagatoFakeBot) -Moomin (@moominvalley) -Peter Drucker (@DruckerBOT) -Random phrases (@kotobabot)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Literature Survey</head><p>Now, let us take a look at the work done earlier and the studies related to our proposed Author Profiling task. Twitter bots are becoming ubiquitous. They are increasingly growing and becoming more creative.</p><p>-Studies show that 16 percent of user accounts have the possibility of being automated <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.54,656.44,15.27,8.64" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</p><p>-A study <ref type="bibr" coords="3,187.60,119.31,16.60,8.64" target="#b8">[10]</ref> reveals that 10.5 percentage of accounts are bots, and around 36.2 percentage categorized as "cyborgs" ("Human Assisted Bots"). -Studies say that a majority of bots lead to "follow-spam" (making a profile as spam by its bot followers) for Twitter users <ref type="bibr" coords="3,302.56,154.71,15.27,8.64" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. -It may serve as a follow back request, as mentioned by Mowbray in his 'The Twittering Machine' <ref type="bibr" coords="3,218.10,178.16,15.27,8.64" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. -According to Lotan <ref type="bibr" coords="3,230.84,189.65,10.58,8.64" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, the bots may be deployed to have a big number of followers for a user who pays a good amount for these fake followers just to raise popularity. -Many bots declare themselves as "automated" and manipulate news feed updates, blog updates, images and video updates with their benign tweets (Ex: Chu, Gianvecchio, Wang, and Jajodia, 2012, p. 812) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,321.19,237.01,15.27,8.64" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. -Twitter is also thinking of using automated bots for various purposes. For example, the account @MagicResend analyzes its followers' Twitter activities and sends the analyzed data which can help in identifying the fake accounts <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.40,272.41,10.58,8.64" target="#b4">[6]</ref>. -'BotOrNot' is a project which determines the probability of an account being a bot based on machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="3,305.81,295.85,10.58,8.64" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. -Other methods of analyzing accounts that were automated have found lower evidence of bot given the verified accounts and for accounts with a high number of followers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,191.57,331.25,15.27,8.64" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</p><p>-Recently a Twitter bot challenge was conducted by DARPA <ref type="bibr" coords="3,388.24,342.74,11.62,8.64" target="#b5">[7]</ref> that aims to identify 'Influence Bots', which are promoting discussions regarding terror activities by ISIS, etc. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,190.99,366.65,15.27,8.64" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. -The paper <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.20,378.14,16.60,8.64" target="#b17">[19]</ref> proposed gender identification in Russian Tweets with different classical ML classifiers, namely Logistic regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM). -PAN 2017 Author Profiling Task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,284.34,413.55,16.60,8.64" target="#b13">[15]</ref> discusses an overview of various approaches based on a deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning. However, deep learning could not outperform traditional machine learning models. -PAN 2018 Author Profiling Task <ref type="bibr" coords="3,287.25,448.95,16.60,8.64" target="#b12">[14]</ref> describes an overview of gender identification from a multimodal perspective, where texts but also images are given as data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Problem Statement</head><p>Bots on social media create influence on the users for commercial, political or ideological purposes by posing as humans. For example, consider when we are shopping we usually check the rating of the product and the number of ratings, taking this as an advantage the bots will rate the product and change the view of the product (positively or negatively). The bots on social media can directly tilt the fate of politics which makes them an even greater threat (for reference see Brexit referendum <ref type="bibr" coords="3,393.36,584.71,11.62,8.64" target="#b6">[8]</ref> or US Presidential elections <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.57,596.66,10.45,8.64" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). This influence made the German political parties reject the use of bots in their election campaign. In other ways, bots are well known for spreading rumours or fake news. With these major threats, the identification of the bots on social media using Author Profiling raised its importance from various domains like marketing, forensics, and security. The aim is to find whether the author is human or bot and if the author is human we have to further classify gender (male or female) based on the tweets given.</p><p>In this section, we will see the data set description and methodology used to build our proposed model and its parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data set Description</head><p>The training data set of the English author profiling task at PAN 2019 consists of XML files each corresponding to a unique author (Twitter user) and there are a total of 4,119 files and a validation set contains 1240 XML files.</p><p>-An XML file for each author (Twitter user) with a total of 100 tweets. The name of the XML file is a unique id that corresponds to the author. -A truth.txt file that contains a list of these author-ids and the truth about gender.</p><p>-The truth file gives the author-id, truth for the human/bot and bot/male/female as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Pre-processing of Data set</head><p>For pre-processing of text, we are using the NLTK library to create a TweetTokenizer, TreeBankTokenizer, etc to perform tokenization and some other procedure using regex and identified the emoticons and renamed them with negative and positive emojis to generalize the emojis used. We are using the following pre-processing steps as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,173.51,404.49,3.74,8.64" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">System Architecture</head><p>The task is to find the gender from a given set of tweets -is it a bot or a human, further a male or a female, in case of a human. For this, we have used the sequential neural network classifier which is fed with 'max-num' frequent words, this sequence is then analyzed to predict the gender. We have also used Linear SVM as a learning algorithm that is used for solving multi-class classification problems from large data sets. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,134.77,517.37,4.98,8.64" target="#fig_1">2</ref> gives an idea of our proposed methodology. We are using vectorize pipeline i.e., we obtained vectors as a pipeline of word and character n-grams. We performed (with using two methods: manually and the scikitlearns grid search function) several hyper-parameter tuning experiments for best parameter values. Finally, we combined the training and validation data and tuned the parameters manually for performing cross-validation. We considered only the English data set for the shared task, but the model can be extended to or implemented on other language data sets as well. We experimented with different features and the final model contains the following n-grams features in it:</p><p>-Word unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.</p><p>-Character (3,5)-grams.</p><p>-Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) weighting.</p><p>-Use of LSA to perform dimensional reduction on n-grams.</p><p>In Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Linear dimensionality reduction was done using truncated Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD), using the TruncatedSVD function from the scikit-learn library. Let us look at the detailed steps and parameters we have tried in the two approaches. One was with neural networks using the 'keras' library. We used three 'dense' layers with 1024, 512, 3 neurons at the corresponding levels, with the activation functions like 'relu', 'sigmoid' and 'softmax'. We used the 'Tokenizer' from keras to prepare the input, which is an index array. The other approach is using 'LinearSVC' itself, but with a different pre-processing. We used the regular expression matching to find typical character sequences that are used as emojis, user-mentions, URLs, etc. and gave them a positive/negative score based on the relevance with the tweet. These two approaches also gave us significant cross-validation results, as shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,401.35,632.53,3.74,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. So, we combined these pre-processing, added a few more as mentioned previously in section 4.2 and made our final model.</p><p>The performance of the proposed author profiling system is calculated by accuracy. First, we need to calculate the accuracy for identifying bots vs humans. Then in the case of humans, we will calculate the accuracy for identifying males vs. females. But, we tried to identify the male or female or bot at first and then from the result, we identified whether it is a human or a bot, just to simplify the approach. The cross-validation results show considerable accuracy compared with the test results provided by organizers. The software submission and evaluation are done using TIRA <ref type="bibr" coords="6,374.34,221.51,15.27,8.64" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. We hope to increase the accuracy by adding more bot specific and relevant features in pre-processing in the future.</p><p>The profiling data is distributed into train and validation sets. So, to avoid leaving aside a significant portion of the training set for validation and to prevent over-fitting on the training set, we combined the data set and evaluated the accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated using stratified 3-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold cross-validation during our experiments. Here, Table <ref type="table" coords="6,252.69,306.50,4.98,8.64" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the cross-validation result which helps to choose the best model. We have submitted the TweetNorm+TweetTok+SVM model to the organizers. Our model got a test accuracy of 0.7242 for bots vs. humans and 0.4951 for gender, which for the English data set alone <ref type="bibr" coords="6,284.37,467.99,15.27,8.64" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. Low Dimensionality Statistical Embedding (LDSE) <ref type="bibr" coords="6,170.23,479.95,16.60,8.64" target="#b11">[13]</ref> baseline accuracy given by the organizers using Naive Bayes for bots 0.9054 and gender 0.7800.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We have developed an approach to classify the bots and humans on Twitter with better accuracy. We have also provided some hints on the existence of spurious accounts on social media and its future possibilities. We hope the results could have been better if we had done the bots vs. human part first and later the gender classification. However, this task of Author Profiling is still a subject of interest as various methodologies can be applied to increase the performance. So, we hope that our approach would spark some ideas in others for further improvements. Further, unsupervised tweet specific embedding, Twitter POS tagging will improve the results on larger data sets. We could further extend to other social media also like Facebook, Quora, Instagram, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,242.64,654.79,130.07,8.12;4,134.77,549.35,354.34,90.71"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
