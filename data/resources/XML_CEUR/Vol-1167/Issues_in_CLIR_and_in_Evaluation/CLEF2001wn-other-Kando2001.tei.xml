<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The [1] is a series of evaluation workshops, which is designed to enhance research in information retrieval and related text processing techniques, such as summarization, extraction, by providing large-scale test collections and a forum for researchers.</p><p>The purposes of the NTCIR Workshop are the following:</p><p>1. to encourage research in information retrieval (IR), and related text processing technology, including term recognition and summarization, by providing large-scale reusable test collections and a common evaluation setting that allows crosssystem comparisons; 2. to provide a forum for research groups interested in comparing results and exchanging ideas or opinions in an informal atmosphere; 3. to investigate methods for constructing test collections or data sets usable for experiments, and methods for laboratory-type testing of IR and related technology.</p><p>We call the whole process from the data distribution to the final meeting the since we have placed emphasis on the interaction among participants, and the experience gained as all participants learn each other from each other's experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NTCIR: NII-NACSIS Test Collections for Information Retrieval and Text Processing</head><p>The started with the distribution of the training data set on 1 November 1998, and ended with the workshop meeting, which was held on 30 August -1 September 1999 in Tokyo, Japan <ref type="bibr" coords="1,376.17,239.97,10.70,9.96" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. Many interesting papers with various approaches were presented at the meeting. The third day of the meeting was organized as the . The [3], another evaluation workshop of information retrieval and information extraction (named entities) using Japanese newspaper articles, was held consecutively. IREX and NTCIR joined in 2000 and have worked together to organize the NTCIR Workshop. The new tasks of and became feasible with this collaboration.</p><p>The international collaboration to organize Asian languages IR evaluation was proposed at the , which was held in November 1999, in Taipei, Taiwan. According to the proposal, the are organized by Hsin-Hsi Chen and Kuang-hua Chen, National Taiwan University at the second workshop and of Asian languages at the third workshop.</p><p>In the aspect of the organization, the first and second workshop were co-sponsored by the (NII, formerly the National Center for Science Information Systems, NACSIS) and the (JSPS) as part of the (JSPS-RFTF 96P00602). After the first workshop the NACSIS reorganized and changed its name to the NII, in April 2000. At the same time, the (RCIR), a permanent host of the NTCIR Project was launched by the NII. The third workshop will be sponsored by the RCIR at the NII.</p><p>From the second workshop <ref type="bibr" coords="1,460.40,641.97,10.58,9.96" target="#b1">[4]</ref>, tasks are proposed and organized by separate groups outside of the NII. This venture added a variety of tasks to the NTCIR Workshop and as a result, attracted participants from various groups.</p><p>From the beginning of the NTCIR project, we have focused on two directions of investigation, i.e. (1) traditional laboratory-type text retrieval system testing, and (2) challenging issues.</p><p>For the former, we have placed emphasis on retrieval with Japanese and other Asian languages and cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). Indexing texts written in Japanese or other East Asian languages, such as Chinese, is quite different from indexing texts in English, French or other European languages since there is no explicit boundary (i.e., no space) between words in a sentence. CLIR is critical in the Internet environment, especially between languages with completely different origins and structure, such as English and Japanese.</p><p>Moreover, in scientific texts or everyday-life documents, for example Web documents, in East Asian languages, foreign language terms often appear in the native language texts both in their original spelling and in transliterated forms. To overcome the word mismatch that may be caused by such expression variance, cross-linguistic strategies are needed for even the monolingual retrieval of documents of this type <ref type="bibr" coords="2,164.31,348.09,10.72,9.96" target="#b2">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Traditionally, IR has meant the technology that retrieves documents from a huge document collection and produces a ranked list of the retrieved documents in the order of the likelihood of relevance. However, retrieving documents that may contain relevant information is not all that the user may require, and the information in the documents is not always immediately usable. Research on the techniques helping to make the information in the documents more usable, for example, by pinpointing the answer passages in the documents, summarization, etc., and the appropriate evaluation methods are needed.</p><p>Each document genre has its own characteristic and usage pattern, and the criteria determining "successful search" may vary accordingly, although traditional IR research has looked at generalized systems which can handle any kind of document based on the generalized criteria of "successful search". For example, Web document retrieval has different characteristics from those of newspaper or patent retrieval, both with respect to the nature of the document itself and the way it is used. We have been interested in the appropriate evaluation methods for each document genre as well as generalized ones.</p><p>In the next section we outline the previous workshops. Section 3 describes the test collections used and Section 4 report the results. Section 5 introduces the tasks for the third workshop and discusses some thoughts on future directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Previous NTCIR Workshops</head><p>This section outlines the previous NTCIR Workshops.</p><p>Each participant has conducted one or more of the following tasks at the workshop.</p><p>to investigate the retrieval performance of systems that search a static set of documents using new search topics.(J&gt;JE) an ad hoc task in which the documents are in English and the topics are in Japanese.(J&gt;E) -</p><p>(1) to extract terms from titles and abstracts of documents, and (2) to identify the terms representing the "object", "method", and "main operation" of the main topic of each document. The test collection NTCIR-1 was used in these three tasks. In the Ad Hoc Information Retrieval Task, the document collection containing Japanese, English and Japanese-English paired documents is retrieved by Japanese search topics. In Japan, document collections often naturally consist of such a mixture of Japanese and English. Therefore the Ad Hoc IR Task at the NTCIR Workshop 1 is substantially CLIR though some of the participating groups discarded the English part and did the task as Japanese monolingual IR.</p><p>including English-Chinese CLIR (ECIR; E&gt;C) and Chinese monolingual IR (CHIR tasks, C&gt;C) using the test collection CHIB01, consisting of newspaper articles from five newspapers in Taiwan R.O.C. using the test collection of NTCIR-1 and -2, including monolingual retrieval of Japanese and English (J&gt;J, E&gt;E) and CLIR of Japanese and English (J&gt;E, E&gt;J, J&gt;JE, E&gt;JE).</p><p>text summarization of Japanese newspaper articles of various kinds. The NTCIR-2 Summ collection Collection was used. Each task has been proposed and organized by a different research groups rather in an independent way, while keeping good contact and discussion with the NTCIR Project organizing group headed by the author. How to evaluate and what should be evaluated have been thoroughly discussed in a discussion group.</p><p>Below is the list of active participating groups that submitted task results. Thirty-one groups, enrolled to participate in the first NTCIR Workshop. Of these groups, twenty-eight groups enrolled in IR tasks (23 in the Ad Hoc Task and 16 in the Cross-Lingual Task), and nine in the Term Recognition task. Twenty-eight groups from six countries submitted results. Two groups worked without any Japanese language expertise.</p><p>Communications Research Laboratory (Japan), Fuji Xerox (Japan), Fujitsu Laboratories (Japan), Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi Co.(Japan), JUSTSYSTEM Corp.

Among the above, four groups submitted results to both CHTR and JEIR, and three groups submitted results to both JEIR and TSC, and one group did all three tasks. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,122.76,503.49,4.99,9.96">2</ref> shows the distribution of the attribute of each participating group across the tasks.</p><p>ATT of Cambridge/Toshiba/Microsoft (UK), Univ. of Electro-Communications (2) (Japan), Univ. of Library and Information Science (Japan), Univ. of Maryland (US), Univ. of Tokyo (2) (Japan), Yokohama National Univ. (Japan), Waseda Univ. (Japan) Among them, four groups participated in JEIR without any Japanese language expertise. Many groups could not submit the results (more precisely could not conduct the task) in the TSC because they could not obtain the document data.. Of the 18 participants of the Ad Hoc IR of Japanese and English documents at the first workshop: 10 groups participated in the equivalent tasks at the second workshop, i.e., JEIR monolingual IR tasks, or added participating tasks; one changed task to JEIR CLIR; one changed task to TSC; and six did not participate. Among 10 CLIR participants at the first workshop: six continued to participate in the equivalent task, i.e., JEIR-CLIR; two groups changed the tasks to CHTR; and two changed to TSC.</p><p>Among nine participating groups in the Term Recognition Task at the first workshop: six changed tasks to JEIR; two changed to TSC; and two did not participate in the second workshop.</p><p>Of the eight groups from the first workshop that did not participate in the second workshop, six are from Japanese universities, one is from a Japanese company and one is from a university in the UK.</p><p>Among the participants of CHTR, JEIR, and TSC at the second workshop, seven, 12, and four, respectively, are new to the NTCIR Workshop.</p><p>A participant could submit the results of more than one run for each task. Both automatic and manual query constructions were allowed. In the case of automatic construction in the JEIR task, the participants had to submit at least one set of results of the searches using only &lt;Description&gt; fields of the topics as . The intention of this is to enhance cross-system comparison. For optional automatic runs and manual runs, any field, or fields, of the topics could be used. In addition, each participant had to complete a system description form describing the detailed features of the system.</p><p>The relevance judgments were undertaken by pooling methods. The same number of runs were selected from each participating group and the same number of top ranked documents from each run for the topic were extracted and put into the document pool to be judged in order to retain the "fairness" and "equal opportunities" among each participating group. In order to increase the exhaustiveness of the relevance judgments, additional manual searches were conducted for those topics with more relevant documents than a certain threshold (50 in NTCIR-1 and 100 in NTCIR-2). A detailed description of the pooling procedure and the analysis of "fairness" are reported in Kuriyama et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,422.48,152.25,11.60,9.96" target="#b3">[6]</ref> in this volume.</p><p>Human analysts assessed the relevance of retrieved documents to each topic in multi-grades: three grades in the NTCIR-1 and IREX-IR, and four grades in the NTCIR-2 and CIRB010: highly relevant (S), relevant (A), partially relevant (B), irrelevant (C). Some documents will be more relevant than others: either because they contain more relevant information or because the information they contain is highly relevant, then we believe that multi-grade relevance judgments are more natural, or closer to the judgments made in real life <ref type="bibr" coords="4,329.44,290.13,7.48,9.96" target="#b4">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,336.92,290.13,3.74,9.96" target="#b5">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,340.66,290.13,7.48,9.96" target="#b6">[9]</ref>. However the majority of test collections have viewed relevance judgments as binary and this simplification is helpful for evaluators and system designers.</p><p>For NTCIR-1 and -2, two assessors judged the relevance to a topic separately and assigned one of the three or four degrees of relevance. After crosschecking, the primary assessors of the topic, who created the topic, made the final judgment. The was run against two different lists of relevant documents produced by two different thresholds of relevance, i.e.,</p><p>(or "relevant level file" in NTCIR-1, in CIRB010), in which S and A-judgments were rated as "relevant", and</p><p>(or "partial relevant level file" in NTCIR-1, in CIRB010), in which S, A and B-judgments were rated as "relevant", even though the NTCIR-1 does not contain S.</p><p>In addition, we proposed new measures, and , for IR system testing with ranked output based on multigrade relevance judgments <ref type="bibr" coords="4,435.01,548.85,15.30,9.96" target="#b7">[10]</ref>. Intuitively, the highly relevant documents are more important for users than partial relevant ones and the documents retrieved in the higher ranks in the ranked list are more important. Therefore the systems producing the search results in which higher relevant documents in higher ranks in the ranked list should be rated as better. Based on the review of existing IR system evaluation measures, decided that either of proposed measures is single number and averageable over number of topics.</p><p>Most of IR systems and experiments have assumed that the highly relevant items are useful to all users. However some user-oriented studies have suggested that partially relevant items may important for a specific users and they sould not be collapsed into relevant items, but should be analyzed separately <ref type="bibr" coords="4,355.16,744.21,10.65,9.96" target="#b6">[9]</ref>. More investigation is needed. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,99.40,89.37,4.99,9.96">3</ref> shows the IR test collections construced through the First and Second NTCIR Workshops and its ex-partner (now colleague of NTCIR) IREX. Addition to above, contains ca.100 + ca. 2000 ( ) manually created summaries of various types of Japanese newspaper articles 1994, 1995 and 1998.</p><p>More than half of the documents in the NTCIR-1 JE Collection are English-Japanese paired. NTCIR-2 contains author abstracts of conference papers and extended summaries of grant reports.

A sample document record of the JE Collection in the NTCIR-1 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,427.37,581.37,3.72,9.96">2</ref>. Documents are plain text with SGML-like tags in the NTCIR collections and the IREX-IR. A record may contain document ID, title, a list of author(s), name and date of the conference, abstract, keyword(s) that were assigned by the author(s) of the document, and the name of the host society.</p><p>A sample Document record used in the CLIR at the NTCIR Workshop 3 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,485.35,673.29,3.77,9.96">3</ref>. All the document collection in four languages are coded in the same set of mandatory tags and some optional tags. A document record in the CIRB010 is coded by XML, but the elements are similar. A sample topic record which will be used in the CLIR at the NTCIR Workshop 3 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="6,276.22,100.77,3.77,9.96">4</ref>. Topics are defined as statements of "users requests" rather than "queries", which are the strings actually submitted to the system, since we wish to allow both manual and automatic query construction from the topics. Among the 83 topics of the NTCIR-1, 20 topics were translated into Korean and were used with the Korean HANTEC Collection <ref type="bibr" coords="6,225.72,181.17,16.69,9.96" target="#b8">[11]</ref> The topics contain SGML-like tags. A topic in NTCIR-1, NTCIR-2 and CIRB010 contains similar tag set though tags are longer than above (ex. &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;), and consists of the title of the topic, a description (question), a detailed narrative, and a list of concepts and field(s). The title is a very short description of the topic and can be used as a very short query that resembles those often submitted by end-users of Internet search engines. Each narrative may contain a detailed explanation of the topic, term definitions, background knowledge, the purpose of the search, criteria for judgment of relevance, etc. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;/CONC&gt; &lt;/TOPIC&gt;</head><p>The relevance judgments were conducted using multi-grades as stated in the section 2.3. In NTCIR-1 and -2, relevance judgment files contain not only the relevance of each document in the pool, but also contain extracted phrases or passages showing the reason the analyst assessed the document as "relevant". These statements were used to confirm the judgments and also hoped future use in experiments of the extracting answer passages or so.</p><p>NTCIR-1 contains "Tagged Corpus". This contains detailed hand-tagged part-of-speech (POS) tags for 2,000 Japanese documents selected from NTCIR-1. Spelling errors are manually collected. Because of the absence of explicit boundaries between words in Japanese sentences, we set three levels of lexical boundaries (i.e., word boundaries, and strong and weak morpheme boundaries).</p><p>In NTCIR-2, the segmented data of the whole J (Japanese document) collection is provided. They are segmented into three levels of lexical boundaries using a commercially available morphological analyzer called HAPPINESS. An analysis of the effect of segmentation is reported in Yoshioka et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,312.16,313.65,16.78,9.96" target="#b9">[12]</ref> The test collections NTCIR-1 and -2 have been tested for the following aspects so that they can be used as a reliable tool for IR system testing: exhaustiveness of the document pool inter-analyst consistency and its effect on system evaluation topic-by-topic evaluation.</p><p>The results have been reported and published on various occasions <ref type="bibr" coords="6,409.81,474.93,12.16,9.96" target="#b10">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,421.97,474.93,4.05,9.96" target="#b11">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,421.97,474.93,4.05,9.96" target="#b12">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,426.02,474.93,12.16,9.96" target="#b13">[16]</ref>. In terms of exhaustiveness, pooling the top 100 documents from each run worked well for topics with fewer than 100 relevant documents. For topics with more than 100 relevant documents, although the top 100 pooling covered only 51.9% of the total relevant documents, coverage was higher than 90% if combined with additional interactive searches. Therefore, we conducted additional interactive searches for the topics with more than 50 relevant documents in the first workshop, and those with more than 100 relevant documents in the second workshop.</p><p>When the pool size was larger than 2500 for a specific topic, the number of documents collected from each submitted run was reduced to 90 or 80. It was done to keep the pool size practical and manageable for assessors to keep consistency in the pool. Even though the numbers of documents collected to the pool were different according to each topic, the number of documents collected from each run is exactly the same for a specific topic.</p><p>It was found a strong correlation between the system rankings produced using different relevance judgments and different pooling methods, regardless of the inconsistency of the relevance assessments among analysts and regardless of the different pooling methods <ref type="bibr" coords="7,140.95,94.89,12.03,9.96" target="#b3">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,152.98,94.89,8.02,9.96" target="#b10">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,161.00,94.89,4.01,9.96" target="#b11">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,165.01,94.89,12.03,9.96" target="#b12">[15]</ref>. It served as an additional support to the analysis reported by Voorhees <ref type="bibr" coords="7,252.30,106.29,15.40,9.96" target="#b14">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The 17 search results of ECIR task are submitted from 7 participating groups. According to the task overview report <ref type="bibr" coords="7,143.23,186.93,15.23,9.96" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, query expansion is a good method to increase system performance. In general, the probabilistic model shows better performance. For ECIR task, select-all approach seems to be better than other select-X approaches in dictionary look-up, if no further techniques are adopted. PIRCS used MT approach and it out performed. For ECIR task, word-based indexing approach is better.</p><p>[19] There were 95 submitted runs for CLIR of Japanese and English from 14 groups. For J-E, E-J, J-JE, E-JE, 40 runs from 12 group, 30 runs from 10, 14 runs from 6, and 11 runs from 4 were submitted respectively.</p><p>Most of groups used query translation approach but LISIF group used an approach combined query translation and query translation. The top 1000 documents in the initial search were translated and further processing was done on them. Three groups used corpus based approach but generally the performances were less effective compared with other approach though some of them participated in the NTCIR Workshop 1 and the relative performance was better. New approaches including flexible pseudo-relevance feedback, segmented LSI were proposed.</p><p>In the round table dicussion at the NTCIR Workshop 3 and the Program committee meeting, and after Workshop meeting, some issues were raised to conduct more appropriate and valid evaluation at the next workshop.</p><p>CHTR and JEIR at the second workshop were organized rather an independent way but we aimed to follow the consistent or at least compatible procedures each other. However regretably we could find unintended incompatibility between CHTR and JEIR including categories of query types and pooling methods. The CLIR task at the NTCIR Workshop 3 will be organized by the organizers of CHTR and JEIR, and HANTEC group. The organizers had face-to-face meetings and decided detailed procedures included topic creation, topic format, document format, query types and mandatory runs. Pooling will be done once, so there will never be inconsistency. For query type, the mandatory run is the one using &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; only and we are also keen to the difference between search using &lt;CONCEPT&gt; or without it. For the details, please consult http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/workshop/clir/CFPinN TCIR3CLIRr.htm</p><p>The other issue is reuse of training set and experiment design using paired corpus. At the NTCIR Workshop 3, bigger and higher quality paired corpus of English and Japanese will be provided in the Patent Retrieval Task, but we plan to allow to use 1995-1997 parallel corpus for training and dictionary development and the test will be done using full patent documents of 1998-1999 and parallel corpus of 1998-1999 are not allowed to use. Documents sets were also problematic. At the Second workshop, text summarization task used Mainichi Newspaper corpus of 1994, 1995 and 1998 and asked the participants obtained the data from the newspaper company since they sell the corpus for research purpose use. As a results some of the participating groups did not obtain the data and could not conduct the task. For the next workshop, the NII will provide all the data for participants though the Mainichi Newspaper documents allowed only limited years of use; two years for Japanese participants, and up to 7 years for participants from outside Japan.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Precision Oriented Evaluation (QA, Web) For (1), it was our first trial of the CLEF model in the Asia. Also we would like to invite any other language groups who wish to join us by providing document data and relevance judgments or by providing query tranlsation.</p><p>For (3), we suppose that idintifying most relevant passage in the retrieved documents are needed when retrieving longer documents like Web documents or patents. The primary evaluation will be done document base but we will use the submitted passages as a secondary information for further analysis.</p><p>(4). For Patent and Web tasks, we invite any research groups who are interested in the research using the document collection provided in the tasks for any research projects. Those document collections are rather new to our research community and many interesting characteristics are included. Also we expect that this venture will explore the new possible tasks for the future workshop.</p><p>For (5), we have used multigrade relevance judgment so far and proposed new measures, Weighted Average Precision and Weighted R Precision for the purpose. We will continue this line of investigation and will add "top relevant" for Web Task as well as evaluation by trec_eval.</p><p>In the future, we desire the enhancement of the investigation in the following directions: Evaluation of CLIR systems Evaluation of retrieval of new document genres and more realistic evaluation Evaluation of technology to make information in the documents immediately usable.</p><p>One of the problems of CLIR is the availability of resources that can be used for translation. Enhancement of the processes of creating and sharing the resources is important. In the NTCIR Workshops, some groups automatically constructed a bilingual lexicon from a quasi-paired document collection. Such paired documents can be easily found in non-English speaking countries and on the Web. Studying the algorithms to construct such resources and sharing them is one practical way to enrich the applicability of CLIR. International collaboration is needed to construct multilingual test collections and to organize the evaluation of CLIR, since creating topics and relevance judgments are language-and cultural-dependent, and must be done by native speakers. Cross-lingual summarization and qustion answering are also considered for the future workshops.</p></div>			</div>
