<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The aim for CLIR (Cross-Language Information Retrieval) systems is to retrieve a set of documents written in different languages as an answer to a query in a given language. Several approaches exists for this task, like translating the whole document collection to an intermediate language or translating the question to every language found in the collection.</p><p>For query translation two architectures are known: centralized and distributed architectures <ref type="bibr" coords="1,499.72,523.86,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Centralized architecture handles document collection in different languages as a single document collection, replacing the original query by the sum of translations in all possible languages found in collection. In the distributed architecture, documents in different languages are indexed and retrieved separately. Later on, all ranked lists are merged into a single multilingual ranked list.</p><p>We use a distributed architecture, focusing on a solution for the merging problem. Our merging strategy consists in calculating a new RSV (Retrieval Status Value) for each document of the ranked lists at every monolingual list. The new RSV, called two-step RSV, is calculated reindexing the retrieved documents according to a vocabulary generated from query translations, where words are aligned by meaning, i.e. each word is aligned with its translations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,454.33,631.46,9.97,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper has been organized into three main sections: a brief revision of merging strategies and the 2-step RSV approach, a description of the proposed decompounding algorithm and a description of ours experiments. Finally, section 5 outlines some conclusions, and also future research lines.</p><p>2 Merging strategies and 2-step RSV approach IR distributed architectures require result merging: to integrate the ranked lists returned by each database/language into a single, coherent ranked list. This task can be difficult because document rankings and scores produced by each language are based on different corpus statics such as inverse document frequencies, and may be different representations and/or retrieval algorithms that usually cannot be compared directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Traditional merging strategies</head><p>There are various approaches in order to carry out the merging of monolingual collections, anyhow a large decrease of precision is generated in the process (depending on the collection, between 20 % and 40 %) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,144.16,205.77,12.73,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Perhaps for this reason, CLIR systems based on document translation tend to obtain results noticeably better than system driven by query translation. Most popular approaches using query translation are round-robin algorithms and computing normalized scores. Other approach is depicted in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,225.32,241.63,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>: a single and multilingual index is obtained with the whole of documents of every language, without any translation. Then, the user query is translated for each language present in the multilingual collection. A query for each translation is not generated but all the translations are concatenated making up a composite query. Finally, this composite query will be searched across the entire multilingual term index. The idea is coherent, but current researches with this method are disappointing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,288.20,301.41,12.98,8.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,304.50,301.41,7.01,8.74" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Finally, learning-based algorithms are very interesting, but they requires learning data (relevance judgments) and it is not always available. Thus, Le Calvé and Savoy <ref type="bibr" coords="2,400.98,325.32,10.52,8.74" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,415.32,325.32,12.73,8.74" target="#b9">10]</ref> propose a merging approach based on logistic regression and Martínez-Santiago et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,379.29,337.27,14.86,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref> improve slightly regression logistic results by using LVQ neural networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">2-step RSV and mixed 2-step RSV</head><p>Last year we obtain good results by using a new approach called 2-step RSV <ref type="bibr" coords="2,428.93,395.15,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The hypothesis of this method is as follows: given two documents, the score of both documents will be comparable whenever the document frequency is the same for each meaningful term query and their translations. By grouping together the document frequency for each term and its own translations, we ensure the hypothesis compliance.</p><p>The basic 2-step RSV idea is straightforward: given a query term and their translations to the rest of languages, their document frequencies are grouping together <ref type="bibr" coords="2,389.47,466.89,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In this way, the method requires recalculating the document score by changing the document frequency of each query term. Given a query term, the new document frequency will be calculated by means of the sum of the monolingual document frequency of the term and their translations. Since reindexing the whole multilingual collection could be computationally expensive, given a query only the retrieved documents for each monolingual collection are re-indexed. These two steps are:</p><p>1. The document pre-selection phase consists in translating and searching the query on each monolingual collection as usual in CLIR systems based on query translation. This phase produces two results:</p><p>• The translation to the rest of languages for each term from the original query as result of the translation process. In this way, we have queries aligned at term level.</p><p>• A single multilingual collection of preselected documents as result of the union of typically 1000 first retrieved documents for each language 2. The re-indexing phase consists of re-indexing the multilingual retrieved collection, but considering solely the query vocabulary, by grouping together their document frequencies. Finally, the query is executed against the new index. Thus for example, if we have two languages, Spanish and English, and the term "casa" is part of the original query and it is translated to "house" and "home", both terms represent exactly the same index token. Given a document, the term frequency will be calculated as usual, but the document frequency will be the sum of the document frequency of "casa", "house" and "home"<ref type="foot" coords="2,444.42,717.85,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>Perhaps the strongest constraint for this method is that every query term must be aligned with its translations. But this information is not always available neither by machine translation (which produces translations at phrase level) nor by automatic query expansion techniques such as pseudo-relevance feedback.</p><p>As a way to deal with partially aligned queries (i.e. queries with some terms not aligned), we propose three approaches by mixing evidence from aligned and not aligned terms <ref type="bibr" coords="3,447.57,183.75,15.50,8.74" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,466.39,183.75,11.63,8.74" target="#b12">13]</ref>:</p><p>• Raw mixed 2-step RSV method: An straightforward and effective way to partially solve this problem is by taking non-aligned words into account locally, just as terms of a given monolingual collection. Thus, given a document, the weight of a non-aligned term is the initial weight calculated in the first step of the method.</p><p>Thus, the score for a given document d i will be calculated in a mixed way by means of the weight of local terms and global concepts present in the query:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,214.09,300.08,298.91,13.68">RSV i = α • RSV align i + (1 -α) • RSV nonalign i (1)</formula><p>where RSV align i is the score calculated by means of aligned terms, such as original 2-step RSV method depicts. In the other hand, RSV nonalign i is calculated locally. Finally, α is a constant (usually fixed to α = 0.75).</p><p>• Normalized mixed 2-step RSV method: Since the weights of the aligned and non-aligned words are not comparable, the idea for the raw mixed 2-step RSV seems counterintuitive.</p><p>As an attempt to make RSV align and RSV nonalign comparable, we normalize those values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,114.91,428.60,408.24,36.02">RSV i = α• RSV align i -min(RSV align ) max(RSV align ) -min(RSV align ) +(1-α)• RSV nonalign i -min(RSV nonalign ) max(RSV nonalign ) -min(RSV nonalign )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>• mixed 2-Step RSV method and learning-based algorithms such as logistic regression or neural networks <ref type="bibr" coords="3,157.71,499.63,14.62,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Training data must be available in order to fit the model. This a serious drawback, but this approach allows integrating not only aligned and not aligned scores but also the original rank of the document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Decompounding algorithm</head><p>In some languages like Dutch, Finnish, German and Swedish there are words formed up by concatenation of others. These are the so called compound words which, if untreated, may bias the performance of our multilingual system. In order to increase the recall, compound words must be decompounded. Unfortunally there is no straighforward method to do so, due to high number of possible decompositions exhibited by many compound words.</p><p>Chen <ref type="bibr" coords="3,131.61,638.05,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposes an approach towards a maximal decomposition applied on German documents: decompositions with a minimal number of components and, in case of multiple options, the one with highest probability, are chosen. In this way, decomposition is performed with a minimal set of rules and a dictionary which must contain no compound words. Chen has applied this algorithm only on German corpora, so no data about its effectiveness on other languages is available. Also we find that applying decomposition on every compound word may not be desirable, since some of these words have a meaning which, when decomposed, is lost.</p><p>Hollink et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,172.15,721.73,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> provide a review on compound words for Dutch, German and Swedish, giving the connectives used for compositioning by each of these languages. They apply an existing recursive algorithm for finding all possible decompositions using a dictionary generated from the collection of documents. This work is very illustrative for decomposition of words, but lacks of a proposal for selection. Our adopted solution is based mainly on Chen approach, but preserving compound word in some cases and extending the algorithm to Dutch and Swedish. We stablish three main rules as core of the algorithm. First, the word is decomposed to all possible compositions as done by Hollink et al. Then, given a compound word cw formed from composites w 1 , w 2 ...w n we select a decomposition by applying following rules:</p><p>1. Rule 1. We do not decompose if the probability of the compound word is higher than any of its composites.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="4,102.18,239.54,376.39,34.64">P (cw) ≤ P (w 1 ) ∧ P (cw) ≤ P (w 2 ) ∧ ... ∧ P (cw) ≤ P (w n ) -→ cw is returned 2. Rule 2.</formula><p>Shortest decomposition (that one with the lowest number of composites) is selected.</p><p>For example, if we find that cw can be decomposed into two forms w 1 + w 2 or w 3 + w 4 + w 5 the first decomposition would be selected.</p><p>3. Rule 3. In case several decompositions have the same number of composites, that one with highest probability will be chosen. The probability of a composition is the same as proposed by Chen: the product of the probabilities of its composites:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="4,203.14,361.03,221.64,9.65">P (w 1 + w 2 + ... + w n ) = P (w 1 ) • P (w 2 ) • ... • P (w n )</formula><p>where the probability for a word w i in a collection is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="4,263.43,411.29,99.86,26.56">P (w i ) = tf c(w i ) N j=1 tf c(w j )</formula><p>being tf c(w i ) the number of ocurrences of word w i in a collection whose dictionary contains N different words. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments and results</head><p>We have participated on 4-Multi and 8-Multi tasks. Every collection has been pre-processed as usual, using stopword lists and stemming algorithms available across the Web<ref type="foot" coords="4,456.39,632.48,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . Stopword lists have been increased with terms such as "retrieval", "documents", "relevant". . . . Once the collections have been pre-processed, they are indexed with the Zprise IR system, using the OKAPI probabilistic model <ref type="bibr" coords="4,169.02,669.92,17.82,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This OKAPI model has also been used for the on-line re-indexing process required by the calculation of 2-step RSV. The rest of this section depicts bilingual experiments and multilingual experiments driven by query-translation with fully and partially aligned queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Translation strategy and Bilingual Results</head><p>The translation approach is very simple. We have used Babylon<ref type="foot" coords="5,385.56,128.83,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_2">3</ref> to translate English query terms. Since English to Finnish dictionary is not available in Babylon site, we use FinnPlace online dictionary<ref type="foot" coords="5,166.20,152.75,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_3">4</ref> . Both bilingual dictionary may suggest not only one, but several terms for the translation of each word. In our experiments, we decide to pick the first translation available. In addition, we have retrieved documents by using non-expanded and expanded queries (pseudorelevance feedback, PRF). Non-expanded queries are fully aligned queries. Queries expanded by pseudo-relevance feedback are expanded with monolingüal collection-depended words. Usually, such words will be not aligned. The first group of queries is used by testing original 2-Step RSV. Mixed 2-Step RSV is tested by considering second group of queries.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="5,135.05,238.01,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> depicts the bilingual precision obtained by means of both translation approaches. We have taken into account only Title and Description query fields. The expansion queries were carried out by means of pseudo-relevance feedback (blind expansion). In this study, we adopted Robertson-Croft's approach <ref type="bibr" coords="5,356.55,429.18,18.37,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref> where the system expands the original query generally no more than 15 search keywords, extracted from the 10-best ranked documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Multilingual results</head><p>The obtained bilingual results list are the starting point, the first step in order to provide users with a single list of retrieved documents. In this section, we study the second step. Suddenly, an implementation error has damaged dramatically over own official runs based en 2-Step RSV approach <ref type="foot" coords="5,132.92,533.66,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_4">5</ref> .We have decided to include both official and fixed runs. The merging approach has been made up by using several approaches: round-robin, raw scoring, normalized score and 2-step RSV approach. In addition, theoretical optimal performance has been calculated by using the procedure proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,290.09,571.10,10.51,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (label "Optimal performance" in table <ref type="table" coords="5,473.71,571.10,4.43,8.74">4</ref>) . Such procedure computes the optimal performance that could possibly be achieved by a CLIR System by merging bilingual and monolingual results, under the constraint that the relative ranking of the documents in the individual ranked list is preserved. The relevances of documents must be known previously. Thus it is not useful to predict ranks of documents in the multilingual list of documents. Anyhow, the procedure obtains the upper-bound performance for a set of ranked list of document, and this information is useful to measure the performance of several merging strategies. Note that 2-step RSV calculus does not ensure the preservation of the relative ranking of documents, the upper-bound performance calculated by such procedure could be overcame, at least theoretically. The detailed description of the algorithm is available in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,414.87,678.69,10.79,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The proposal 2-step RSV merging approach improves the whole of the rest of approaches. Raw mixed 2-step RSV and normalized mixed 2-step RSV have been calculated by means of eq. 1 and eq. 2, with α = 0.75. Mixed 2-step by means of logistic regression and neural networks are not available in this work because training data(relevance judgments) for the new collections of this year is not available. The good performance of raw-mixed 2-step RSV is counterintuitive. Nevertheless , not the whole of terms to be added to the original query are new terms since some terms obtained by means of pseudo-relevance feedback are in the initial query. In the other hand, as table <ref type="table" coords="6,452.91,502.73,4.98,8.74">4</ref> shows, rawscoring works relatively fine for this experiment. Thus, the percent (0.25) of local RSV added to each document score is partially comparable. However, normalized mixed 2-step RSV should improve raw mixed 2-step RSV whether collections are very irregular or very different weighting schemas are used for each collection. Finally, experiments carried out with CLEF 2001 (training) and CLEF 2002 (evaluation) relevance judgments show that learning-based algorithms overcome slightly raw-scoring as a way to integrate both available values when mixed 2-step is used <ref type="bibr" coords="6,492.06,574.46,16.75,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Anyway, the mixing of both local and global score obtained for each document by means of mixed 2-step RSV is an open problem about the integration of several sources of information, and it remembers to the same collection fusion problem.</p><p>Maybe the most interesting issue obtained for us this year is depicted in figures 1 and 2. As we suspected last year, round-robin and raw-scoring performs worse when the number of languages is increased. In the other hand, 2-step RSV holds about 85 % of optimal performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and future work</head><p>This year, merging approaches and decompounding algorithms have been treated . We have tested 2-step RSV and mixed 2-step RSV with 4-Multi a 8-Multi tasks. Results show that the proposed method scales well with four, five and eight languages, overcoming traditional approaches. Our next efforts are directed towards three aspects:  • Since decompounding algorithm is highly depend of the wordlists used, we aim to obtain a better wordlist.</p><p>• Testing the method with other translation strategies such as Machine Translation or Multilingual Similarity Thesaurus.</p><p>• Index terms used in reported experiments are basically obtained by means of stemming. We are very interested in the application of the proposed approach to n-grams indexing. While stemming terms are directly assimilable as feasible representative of concepts, n-grams are not able to be assimilated directly as concepts since given a n-gram usually is contained by several unrelated terms. In addition, we have carried out preliminary experiments, and the obtained results suggest that a n-gram is not a representant of a concept directly.</p><p>• Finally, we will keep on studying strategies in order to deal with aligned and not-aligned queries term. The integration of both sort of terms by means of neural networks (although these structures require training data) and development of global pseudo-relevance feedback, and not locally for each monolingual collection, constitutes interesting ways to explore.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="7,90.00,291.71,423.00,8.74;7,90.00,303.35,222.60,7.86;7,159.77,323.67,283.49,168.73"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Performance of traditional merging strategies respect of several set of languages (fully aligned queries).

Okapi index is used by monolingual runs. TF index is used by the second step of 2-step RSV method: since re-weighting query terms is required, such re-weighting process get term-frequency statistics from TF-index files. In some languages such as English, we make a mistake by taking into account OKAPI-index files instead of TF-index files.</p></note>
