Searching in a large amount of data is not easy, thus how to retrieve multimedia data precisely becomes an important research issue. Two types of approaches, i.e., content-based and text-based approaches, are usually adopted. Content-based approaches use low-level visual features such as color, texture and shape to represent multimedia objects. Text-based approaches use collateral texts to describe the objects. Low-level visual features only show what the images or the videos look like, but cannot tell us what exactly the images or videos are. On the other hand, text can describe the content of multimedia objects. Several hybrid approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="1,70.92,404.31,73.75,8.74" target="#b13">(Westerveld, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,153.46,404.31,22.81,8.74" target="#b14">(Westerveld, , 2002;;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords=""></ref> The <ref type="bibr" coords="1,200.47,404.31,93.34,8.74" target="#b11">Lowlands team, 2002)</ref> that integrate visual and textual information had been proposed. The results showed that the optimal technique depends on the query. The combined approach could outperform text-and content-based approaches in some cases.</p><p>In image retrieval task, most of the previous works focused on monolingual retrieval. Seldom work was done on cross-language image retrieval. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,240.48,450.27,121.97,8.74" target="#b10">Sanderson and Clough (2002)</ref> pointed out the need of cross-language image retrieval and discussed some issues in image CLIR. Images are good media in the context of cross language. People with no strong language skills can easily understand and judge the relevance of the retrieved images. In this paper, we adopt text-based approach to deal with the Chinese-English cross-language image retrieval problem. Query translation is adopted to unify the languages of queries and image captions. Proper nouns processing plays an important role in query translation <ref type="bibr" coords="1,325.12,507.69,93.01,8.74" target="#b0">(Bian and Chen, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,421.35,507.69,47.33,8.74" target="#b8">Oard, 1999)</ref>. IR systems must handle proper nouns transliteration approximately to achieve better performance. We propose a similaritybased backward transliteration model to translate the proper nouns.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes similarity-based backward transliteration. Section 3 shows the query translation methods. Section 4 discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the remarks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.1</head><p>Similarity-Based Backward Transliteration <ref type="bibr" coords="1,70.92,632.91,32.11,8.74">Lin and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,106.73,632.91,77.59,8.74">Chen (2000, 2002)</ref> proposed a similarity-based framework to model backward transliteration. In the similarity-based framework, the similarities of a transliterated word and candidate words are computed, and the candidate word with the highest similarity is chosen as the original word. The similarities can be measured at three levels, i.e. physical sounds, graphemes and phonemes. Comparing similarities at phoneme level has been shown to outperform the grapheme level <ref type="bibr" coords="1,246.96,678.87,36.03,8.74">(Lin and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,287.40,678.87,76.14,8.74">Chen, 2000, 2002)</ref>. When comparing similarities at the phoneme level, the transliterated word and candidate words are first transformed into the phonetic representations, i.e. International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and then the similarities of the IPA strings are measured.</p><p>The similarity score of two strings is the score of the optimal alignment. Given two strings S 1 and S 2 , let Σ be the alphabet of S 1 and S 2 , Σ'={Σ, '_'}, where '_' stands for space. Space could be inserted into S 1 and S 2 such that they are of equal length and denoted as S 1 ' and S 2 '. S 1 ' and S 2 ' are aligned when every character in either string is opposite a unique character or space in the other string. The similarity score of an alignment is measured using the following formula.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,126.78,108.31,395.50,27.56">∑ = = l i i S i S s Score 1 2 1 )) ( ' ), ( ' ( (1)</formula><p>where s <ref type="bibr" coords="2,146.61,140.19,21.96,8.74">(a, b)</ref> is the similarity score between the character a and b in Σ', S'(i) is the i th character in the string S', and l is the length of S 1 ' and S 2 '. The similarity score s(a, b) can be manually assigned or automatically learned. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.39,174.63,89.15,8.74" target="#b7">Lin and Chen (2002)</ref> proposed a learning approach based on Widrow-Hoff rule <ref type="bibr" coords="2,314.26,186.09,79.35,8.74" target="#b5">(Duda et al., 2001)</ref> to acquire phonetic similarities from a training corpus. The learning algorithm can capture subtle similarities that cannot easily be manually assigned based on phonological knowledge. The experiment results showed that learned similarities are more discriminative than manually assigned one.</p><p>The optimal alignment of two strings S 1 and S 2 can be computed efficiently using dynamic programming. Let T is an n+1 by m+1 table, where n and m are the length of S 1 and S 2 respectively. By filling table T row by row, we can obtain the optimal alignment and the similarity score of S 1 and S 2 . The base condition is defined as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,125.88,273.01,396.40,53.73">∑ ≤ ≤ = i k k S s i T 1 1 ) _' ' ), ( ( ) 0 , ( ∑ ≤ ≤ = j k k S s j T 1 2 )) ( , _' (' ) , 0 ( (2)</formula><p>The recurrence formula is defined as follows.</p><p>[ ]</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,106.92,347.06,415.36,34.87">) ( , _' (' ) 1 , ( ), _' ' ), ( ( ) , 1 ( ), ( ), ( ( ) 1 , 1 ( max ) , ( 2 1 2 1 j S s j i T i S s j i T j S i S s j i T j i T + - + - + - - = (3) where 1≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Candidate Filter</head><p>Similarity based backward transliteration with automatically learned phonetic similarities works well, but it will cost too much time if there are a lot of candidate words. That is not suitable for some applications like online IR systems. To reduce processing time, we take a pre-process to decrease the number of candidates. A transliterated word and its original word should contain the same or the similar phonemes, and the order of the phonemes are the same. In other words, if two IPA strings contain more identical or similar characters, their similarity may be higher. A vector space IR model is adopted to select the appropriate candidates for a transliterated word. The document set is the IPA strings of a list of proper nouns in source language. Each proper noun is treated as one document. The query is the IPA string of the transliterated word. After retrieving, the top ranked documents (candidate words) are selected as the appropriate candidates of the transliterated word.</p><p>The transliterated word and its original word do not always contain the same phonemes due to the different pronunciation of different languages. For example, the English phoneme 'g' is usually transliterated into Chinese phoneme 'k'<ref type="foot" coords="2,157.20,543.85,3.24,5.65" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . If only the phonemes of the transliterated word are used as the query terms, the original word may not be retrieved. Thus, the query has to be expanded with the most co-transliterated phonemes. The co-transliterated Chinese-English phoneme pairs are trained from a Chinese-English person name corpus, which has 51,114 pairs of Chinese transliterated names and the corresponding English original names. A variance of Mutual Information is adopted to measure the strength of co-transliteration of two phonemes. The variant Mutual Information can solve the preferring rare terms problem that traditional Mutual Information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,478.98,603.51,45.49,8.74;2,70.92,614.97,39.29,8.74" target="#b4">(Church, et al., 1989)</ref> has. Let x is a Chinese phoneme and y is an English phoneme, the Mutual Information of x and y is defined as follows:</p><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="2,126.78,638.69,395.49,25.20">) , ( log( ) ( ) ( ) , ( log ) , ( y x f y p x p y x p y x MI × = (4)</formula><p>where p(x) is the occurrence probability of phoneme x in Chinese names, p(y) is the occurrence probability of phoneme y in English names, p(x, y) is the probability of x and y that occur in a pair of transliterated and original name, and f(x, y) is the frequency of x and y that occur in a pair of transliterated and original name.</p><p>A phoneme x in a transliterated word will be expanded with the phonemes that have positive MI values with x.</p><p>The augmented phonemes are weighted by MI(x, y)/the number of augmented terms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Query Translation</head><p>In the experiments, Chinese queries were used as the source language queries. The Chinese queries are translated from English by native speakers. We adopted query translation to unify the languages of queries and documents. First, the Chinese queries were segmented by a word recognition system, tagged by a POS tagger and name entities were identified <ref type="bibr" coords="3,211.31,181.23,78.94,8.74" target="#b2">(Chen, et al., 1998)</ref>. For each Chinese query term, we found its translation equivalents by looking up a Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. The bilingual dictionary is integrated from four resources, including LDC Chinese-English dictionary, Denisowski's CEDICT<ref type="foot" coords="3,420.72,202.03,3.24,5.65" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , BDC Chinese-English dictionary v2.2<ref type="foot" coords="3,134.40,213.55,3.24,5.65" target="#foot_2">3</ref> and a dictionary used in query translation in MTIR project <ref type="bibr" coords="3,399.20,215.73,95.96,8.74" target="#b0">(Bian and Chen, 2000)</ref>. The dictionary gathers 200,037 words, where a word may have more than one translation. We adopted the following two methods to select appropriate translations.</p><p>(1) CO model <ref type="bibr" coords="3,150.84,250.17,78.15,8.74" target="#b1">(Chen, et al., 1999)</ref> CO model employed word co-occurrence information trained from a target language text collection to disambiguate the translations of query terms. We adopted Mutual Information (MI) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.47,273.15,62.97,8.74;3,106.92,284.67,23.37,8.74" target="#b4">(Church, et al., 1989)</ref> to measure the co-occurrence strength between words. The MI values of English words were trained from TREC6 text collection (Voorhees and Harman, 1997). For a query term, we compared the MI values of all the translation equivalent pairs (x, y), where x is the translation equivalent of this term, and y is the translation equivalent of another query term within a sentence. The word pair (x i , y j ) with the highest MI value is extracted, and the translation equivalent x i is regarded as the best translation equivalent of this query term. Selection is carried out based on the order of the query terms.</p><p>(2) First-two-highest-frequency</p><p>The first two translation equivalents with the highest occurrence frequency in the English image captions were considered as the target language query terms. There are 150 distinct Chinese query terms in 50 topics. Total 16 of the 150 query terms could not be found in our dictionary. Among the 16 terms, 7 terms were tagged as person names, and 5 terms were location names. These names are Chinese translations of foreign names. We can use backward transliteration scheme to translate these names. First, we adopted the transformation rules <ref type="bibr" coords="3,312.87,422.55,83.13,8.74" target="#b3">(Chen, et al., 2003)</ref> to identify the name part and keyword part of a name. The keyword parts are general nouns, e.g., "湖" (lake), "河" (river) and "橋" (bridge), and can be translated by looking up dictionary. We used the first two highest frequency method to translate keywords. The name parts are transliterations of foreign names, and were transliterated into English in the way as follows.</p><p>(1) The person names and the location names in the English image captions were extracted. We collected a list of English names that contained 50,979 person names and 19,340 location names. If a term in the captions can be found in the name list, it was extracted. Total 3,599 names were extracted from the image captions. (2) For each Chinese name, 300 candidates were selected from the 3,599 English names by using the candidate filter described in Section 2.2. (3) The similarity-based backward transliteration approach described in Section 2.1 was adopted to translate the Chinese name. Top 6 candidates with the highest similarities were considered as the translations of the Chinese name. In the segmentation and name identification stage, some terms were segmented or tagged incorrectly. These errors propagated to the translation stage and affected the performance of backward transliteration. In order to evaluate the real performance of similarity-based backward transliteration, we conducted manual runs in which the Chinese queries were segmented and tagged manually. In the manual runs, there are 136 distinct terms and 18 terms have no translations. Among the 18 terms, 5 terms were tagged as person names, 9 terms were location names and 1 term was an organization name.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In the experiments, we adopted text-based approach. The captions were used to represent the images. Okapi IR system <ref type="bibr" coords="4,101.77,108.81,94.76,8.74" target="#b9">(Robertson, et al., 1998</ref>) was adopted to index and retrieve the image captions. The weighting function was BM25. For each image, the caption text, &lt;HEADLINE&gt; and &lt; CATEGORIES&gt; sections were used for indexing. The words in these sections were stemmed, and stopwords were removed. The translated English queries were used to retrieve the image captions. Only the title sections of the topics were used to construct queries.</p><p>We submitted eight runs in CLEF 2003 image track. The performances of two query translation methods with or without similarity-based backward transliteration were compared. The details of the submitted runs are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,135.35,189.21,3.76,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The performances are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,302.37,189.21,3.76,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The results show that using similarity-based backward transliteration to translate proper nouns increases performances. In the automatic segmentation runs, twelve topics have proper nouns that were not contained in our dictionary. After applying similarity-based backward transliteration model, the proper nouns in six topics were translated correctly, and the average precisions of these topics were increased dramatically. The performances of the twelve topics are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,295.96,541.29,3.74,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Terms in square brackets are keywords extracted by transformation rules. In Topic 16, "丹地" (dan di), transliterated from "Dundee", was not translated correctly due to the error of keyword extraction. "丹地" was tagged as a location name, and "地" (di) was identified as a keyword according to the transformation rules. By looking up the dictionary, "地" (di) was translated into "field" and "ground". Only "丹" (dan) was transliterated by similarity-based backward transliteration and the similarity between "丹" (dan) and "Dundee" is low. Five terms were segmented incorrectly, so that they were transliterated incorrectly. In manual segmentation runs, segmentation error problem is excluded. Total 14 topics contain proper nouns, which were not in our dictionary. The performances of seven and ten topics were increased after applying similarity-based backward transliteration model followed CO and first-two-highestfrequency models, respectively. The performances are shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,366.64,652.29,3.77,8.74" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. Examining the results of backward transliteration, the original English words of about 50% Chinese proper nouns were in the top 6 ranks. Recall that the top 6 ranked terms were added to the query. At most one term was the correct word and the others were noises. Although noises were introduced, the performances of the topics in which the proper nouns were backward transliterated correctly were improved. If the performance of backward transliteration is improved and fewer incorrect terms are added to the queries, the retrieval performance should be better. We also found that the original words of four Chinese transliterated words were not included in the name list. Thus, these original English words were not contained in the candidate lists. How to enlarge the coverage of the name list is also an important issue.</p><p>Comparing the performances of two query translation models, surprisingly, CO model was worse than the first-two-highest-frequency model. In CO model, only one translation equivalent is selected for a query term. Since the captions of the images are very short, the suggested English translation may be not used in the captions. If we expand queries or captions, the performance may be better. On the other hand, the first-two-highestfrequency model selects the translations with the highest frequency in the target documents. Most of the English translated query terms present in the captions. The term usage is more consistent in the first-two-highestfrequency model. In this paper we proposed an approach to deal with the Chinese-English cross-language image retrieval problem. Text-based image retrieval and query translation were adopted in the experiments. A similarity-based backward transliteration model with candidate filter was proposed to translate the proper nouns. The experimental results showed that using similarity-based backward transliteration increased the retrieval performances. The average precisions of about 50% topics consisting of proper nouns were increased. The performances of the rest topics were decreased due to the failure of backward transliteration. The errors were caused by segmentation error, named entity identification error, keyword extraction error, and the coverage of the name list. Several methods such as learning phoneme similarity from larger data, extracting more named entities from target document set, and improving the performance of candidate filter and keyword extraction will be further investigated to improve the performance of the similarity-based backward transliteration. The consistency of term usages is also an important issue. The image captions are usually short and the words used in captions are limited. Query expansion or document expansion could resolve this problem.
