<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A usual approach in CLIR is to translate the query to each language present in the corpus, and then run a monolingual query in each language. It is then necessary to obtain a single ranking of documents merging the individual lists from the separate retrieved documents. However, a problem is how to carry out such a merge?. This is known as merging strategies problem and it is not an unimportant problem, since the weight assigned to each document (Retrieval Status Value -RSV) is calculated not only according to the relevance of the document and the IR model used, but also the rest of monolingual corpus to which the document belongs is determinant <ref type="bibr" coords="1,470.05,464.79,9.97,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>There are various approaches to standardise the RSV, but even so a large decrease of precision is generated in the process (depending on the collection, between 20% and 40%) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,439.84,488.70,15.49,8.74" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,458.36,488.70,11.63,8.74" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Perhaps for this reason, CLIR systems based on document translation tend to obtain results which are noticeably better than which only translate the query.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we present a brief revision of the most extended methods for merging strategies. Section 3 and 4 describe our proposed method. In section 5, we detail the experiments carried out with the results obtained. Finally, we present our conclusions and future lines of work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A brief revision of the merging strategies</head><p>For each N language, we have N different lists of relevant documents each obtained independently from the others. The problem is that it is necessary to obtain a single list by merging all the relevant languages. If we suppose that each retrieved document of each list has the same probability to be relevant and the similarity values are therefore directly comparable, then an immediate approach would be simply to order the documents according to their RSV (this method is known as raw scoring) <ref type="bibr" coords="1,128.46,674.98,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,143.03,674.98,7.01,8.74" target="#b7">8]</ref>. However, this method is not adequate, since the document scores computed by each language are not comparable. For example, a document in Spanish that includes the term "información", can calculate a radically different RSV from another document in English with the same term, "information". In general, this is due to the fact that the different indexation techniques take into account not only the term frequency in the document (tf ),but also consider how frequent such a term is in the rest of the documents, that is, the inverse document frequency (idf ) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,114.95,123.98,14.62,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Thus, the idf depends on each particular monolingual collection. A first attempt to make these values comparable is to standardise in some way the RSV reached by each document:</p><p>• By dividing each RSV by the maximum RSV reached in each collection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,237.23,174.42,88.27,22.31">RSV i = RSV i max(RSV )</formula><p>, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</p><p>• A variant of the previous method is to divide each RSV by the difference between the maximum and minimum document score values reached in each collection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,440.52,223.54,14.62,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="2,207.79,243.82,211.25,22.31">RSV i = RSV i -min(RSV ) max(RSV ) -min(RSV ) , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</formula><p>in which RSV i is the original retrieval status value, and max(RSV ) and min(RSV ) are the maximum and minimum document score values achieved by the first and last documents respectively. N is the number of documents in the collection.</p><p>However, the problem only is solved partially, since the normalization of the document score is accomplished independently of the rest of the collections, and therefore, the differences in the RSV are still great.</p><p>Another approach is to apply a round-robin algorithm. In this case, the RSV obtained for each retrieved document is not taken into account, but rather the relative position reached by each document in their collection. A single list of documents is obtained and the document score m is in the position m in the list. Thus for example, if we have five languages and we retrieve five lists of documents, the first five documents of the single result list will coincide with the first document of each list; the next five, with the second document of each list; and so on. This approach is not completely satisfactory because the position reached by each document is calculated exclusively considering the documents of the monolingual collection to the one which belongs.</p><p>Finally, another approach, perhaps the most original, it is to generate a single index with all the documents without taking into account the multilingual nature of the collection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,462.54,460.87,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,476.66,460.87,7.75,8.74" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,488.03,460.87,7.01,8.74" target="#b6">7]</ref>. In this way, a single index is obtained in which the terms from each language are intermixed. In the same way in that all the documents in a single index are merged, we obtain a single query where the terms in several languages also are intermixed. That is, the query must be translated to each of the languages present in the multilingual collection. However, we do not generate a query for each translation, but we merge all the translations forming a single query. This query will then be the one which we contrast with the document collection. As with the approach based on document translation, in this approach the system will always return a single list of documents for each query. In spite of this, the problem is not eliminated: the ranking of each document is dependent on the language in which it is written. Although a single index is generated, the vocabulary of each language is practically exclusive. Two different languages rarely share terms. For this reason, the weight obtained by each term will refer to the language to which it belongs, and therefore, the similarity between documents will be correct with respect to the documents expressed in the same language. Finally, it is necessary to mention that a notable exception are proper names, which are frequently invariable in different languages. In such a case, this approach proves very effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A useful structure to describe IR models</head><p>In this section we present a notation that will be used to describe the proposed model. A large number of retrieval methods are based on this structure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,337.24,706.81,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="2,260.53,726.23,81.94,8.74">&lt; T, Φ, D; f f, df &gt;</formula><p>where:</p><p>• D es is the document collection to be indexed.</p><p>• Φ is the vocabulary used in the indices generated from D.</p><p>• T is the set of all tokens τ present in the collection D, commonly the words or terms. Thus, the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,269.02,175.78,89.88,8.74">ϕ : T → Φ, τ → ϕ(τ )</formula><p>maps the set of all tokens, T ,to the indexing vocabulary Φ.

Although the method is independent of the translation technique, it is necessary to know how each term translates.</p><p>1. 1. The document pre-selection phase consists of translating and running the query on each monolingual collection, D i , as is usual in CLIR systems based on query translation. This phase produces two results:</p><p>• we obtain a single multilingual collection of preselected documents (D collection) as a result of joining all retrieved documents for each language.</p><p>• we obtain the translation to the other languages for each term from the original query as a result of the translation process. That is, we obtain a T vocabulary, where each element τ is called "concept" and consists of each term together with its corresponding translation. Thus, a concept is a set of terms expressed independently of the language.</p><p>2. The re-indexing phase consists of re-indexing the multilingual collection D , but considering solely the T vocabulary. That is, only the concepts are re-indexed. Finally, a new query formed by the concepts in T is generated and this query is executed against the new index.</p><p>Thus for example, if we have two languages, Spanish and English, and the term "casa" is in the original query and it is translated by "house", both terms represent exactly the same concept. If "casa" occurs a total of 100 times in the Spanish collection, and "house" occurs a total of 150 times in the English collection, then the term frequency would be 250. From a practical point of view, in this second phase each occurrence of "casa" is treated exactly just as each occurrence of "house".</p><p>Formally, the method can be described as follows:</p><p>For each monolingual collection we begin with the already-known structure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7" coords="3,224.11,740.63,153.69,9.65">&lt; T i , Φ i , D i , f f, df &gt;, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</formula><p>Where N is the number of present languages in the multilingual collection to be indexed. Let Q = {Q i , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N }, be the set formed by the original query together with its translation to the other languages, in such a way that Q i is the query expressed in the same language as the collection D i . After each translation Q i has been run against its corresponding structure &lt; T i , Φ i , D i , f f, df &gt;, it is possible to obtain a new and single structure:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8" coords="4,246.51,183.75,109.97,8.74">&lt; T , Φ , D, D , f f , df &gt;</formula><p>where:</p><p>• D is the complete multilingual document collection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9" coords="4,345.71,221.29,110.10,9.65">D = {D i , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N }.</formula><p>• D is the set of retrieved multilingual documents as consequence of running the query Q.</p><p>• T is the set of concepts τ j , and denotes the vocabulary of the D collection. Since each query Q i is a translation of another, it is possible to align the queries at term level.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10" coords="4,197.07,296.60,233.78,9.65">τ j := {τ ij ∈ Q i , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N }, 1 &lt;= j = M, M = |Q|</formula><p>where τ ij represents all the translations of the term j of the query Q to the language i. Thus, τ j denotes the concept j of the query Q independently of the language.</p><p>• Φ is a new vocabulary to be indexed, such that each ϕ j ∈ Φ is generated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11" coords="4,217.32,379.92,192.17,9.65">ϕ j := {ϕ(τ ij ), 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N }, 1 &lt;= j &lt;= M</formula><p>• The f f function and df function are interpreted as usual:</p><p>f f is the number of occurrences of the concept j in the k document. That is, the sum of the occurrences of the term j in the query, expressed in language i:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12" coords="4,191.41,469.04,265.92,24.60">f f (ϕ j , d k ) :=| {τ ∈ T | ϕ(τ ) = ϕ j ∧ d(τ ) = d k } | := Σf f (ϕ ij , d k ), ∀ϕ ij ∈ ϕ j , d k ∈ D , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</formula><p>df is the number of documents with the concept j in the D collection. That is, the sum of the documents with the term j in the query, expressed in language i:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13" coords="4,203.67,541.27,242.49,24.60">df (ϕ j ) :=| {d k ∈ D i | ∃τ ∈ T : ϕ(τ ) = ϕ j ∧ d(τ ) = d k } | := Σdf (ϕ ij ), ∀ϕ ij ∈ ϕ j , d k ∈ D, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</formula><p>where df (ϕ ij ) is all the documents that contain the concept j in the monolingual collection D i .</p><p>Given this structure, a new index is generated in run time, but only taking into account the documents that are found in D . The df function operates on the whole collection D, not only on the retrieved documents in the first phase, D . This is so because in practice, we have found that the obtained results have been slightly better when the whole collection has been considered to calculate the idf factor. Once the indices have been generated in this way, the query Q formed by concepts, not by terms, is re-run on the D collection.</p><p>In some ways, this method shares some ideas with the CLIR systems based on corpus translation, but instead of translating the complete corpus, it only translates the words that appear in the query and the retrieved documents. These two simplifications allow the development of the system in run-query time since the necessary re-indexing process in the second phase is computationally possible due to small size of the D collection and to the scarce vocabulary T (approximately, the query terms multiplied by the number of present languages in D ). Some relevant aspects of two-step RSV are:</p><p>• It is easily scalable to several languages.</p><p>• The system requires the term-level alignment of the original query and the translation of its terms. Depending on the approach followed for the translation, this process can prove more or less complex.</p><p>• A term together with its translation are treated in exactly the same way in the proposed model. This is not too realistic since it is usual for the original term and its translations not to be equally weighted. For example, it is possible that for a given language i, we maintain more than one translation for a given concept of the original query. Consequently, the concept frequency will be increased artificially in the documents expressed in the i language. In this case, if we know the translation probability of each term, we can weight each term according to its translation probability with respect to the original term. This can be modelled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14" coords="5,153.05,307.29,320.72,9.65">f f (ϕ j , d k ) := Σf f (ϕ ij , d k ) * w(τ ij ), ∀ϕ ij ∈ ϕ j , ϕ(τ ij ) = ϕ ij , 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</formula><p>where w(τ ij ) represents the translation probability of each translation of term j in the query to language i, default it will be 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Description of Experiments and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Multilingual Experiments</head><p>The experiment has been carried out for the five languages of the multilingual task. Each collection has been pre-processed as usual, using the stopword lists and stemming algorithms available for the participants, except for Spanish, in which we have used a stemming algorithm provided by the ZPrise system<ref type="foot" coords="5,170.20,450.60,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . We have added to the stopword lists terms such as "retrieval", "documents", "relevant"... Due to the German morphological wealth, compound words have been reduced to simple words with the MORPHIX package <ref type="bibr" coords="5,276.86,476.09,9.97,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Once the collections have been pre-processed, they are indexed with the Zprise IR system, using the OKAPI probabilistic model <ref type="bibr" coords="5,433.16,488.04,14.62,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This OKAPI model has also been used for the on-line re-indexing process required by the calculation of two-step RSV. For each query, we have used the Title and Description sections. The method of query translation is very simple: we have used the Babylon<ref type="foot" coords="5,303.63,656.32,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> electronic dictionary to translate query terms <ref type="bibr" coords="5,90.00,669.85,9.97,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For each term, we have considered the first two translations available by Babylon. Words not found in the dictionary have not been translated. This approach allows us to carry out query alignment at term level easily. The obtained results show that the calculation of the two-step RSV improves more than seven points (36% more) the precision reached with respect to other approaches (table <ref type="table" coords="6,475.48,456.01,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). This improvement is approximately constant with short, medium and large queries (table <ref type="table" coords="6,464.24,467.97,3.88,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Bilingual Experiments</head><p>The differences in accuracy between the bilingual experiments may be due to the stemming algorithms used, the quality of which varies according to language. Thus, the simplest stemming algorithm is used for Italian: it removes only inflectional suffixes such as singular and plural word forms or feminine and masculine forms, and it is in this language where the lowest level of accuracy is achieved. Note that the multilingual document list has been calculated starting from the document lists obtained in the bilingual experiments. The accuracy obtained in the UJAMLTDRSV2 experiment is similar to that obtained in the bilingual experiments(table 4), surpassing even the accuracy for German and Italian, and only two points short of that reached in Spanish. Where P os i is the new document position i. P os rsv2 i is the document position reached using twostep RSV, and P os merge-approach i is the document position using the Round-Robin or normalized score approach. As shown in table 5, not only is there no improvement, but the accuracy even decreases slightly. We have presented a new approach to solve the problem of merging relevant documents in CLIR systems. This approach has performed noticeably better than other traditional approaches. To achieve this performance, it is necessary to align the query with its respective translations at term level. Our next efforts are directed towards three aspects:</p><p>• We suspect that with the inclusion of more languages, the proposed method will perform better than other approaches. Our objective is therefore to confirm this suspicion.</p><p>• To test the method with other translation strategies. We have a special interest in the Multilingual Similarity Thesaurus, since this provides a measure of the semantic proximity of two terms. That semantic proximity can be used by our method as the translation probability of a term.</p><p>• Finally, we could study the effect of the pseudo-relevance feedback in the first and second phase of the proposed method.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,95.98,540.79,455.27,86.00"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Description of official Experiments</figDesc><table coords="5,95.98,552.29,455.27,74.49"><row><cell>Experiment</cell><cell>Task</cell><cell>Form</cell><cell>Query</cell><cell>Merging Strategy</cell></row><row><cell>UJAMLTDRR</cell><cell cols="3">Multilingual automatic Title+Description</cell><cell>Round-Robin</cell></row><row><cell>UJAMLTDNORM</cell><cell cols="3">Multilingual automatic Title+Description</cell><cell>Normalized score</cell></row><row><cell>UJAMLTDRSV2</cell><cell cols="3">Multilingual automatic Title+Description</cell><cell>2-Step RSV</cell></row><row><cell>UJAMLTDRSV2RR</cell><cell cols="4">Multilingual automatic Title+Description 2-Step RSV+Round-Robin</cell></row><row><cell>UJABITD{SP,DE,FR,IT}</cell><cell>Bilingual</cell><cell cols="2">automatic Title+Description</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
