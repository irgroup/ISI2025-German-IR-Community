<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This document contains the description of the experiments carried out by SINAI group. We have developed an approach based on several lexical measures integrated by means of dierent machine learning models. More precisely, we have evaluated three features based on lexical similarity.</p><p>In order to calculate the semantic distance between two tokens (stems), we have tried several measures based on Lin's similarity measure. In spite of the relatively straightforward approach we have obtained a remarkable accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach description</head><p>Our system is based on a machine learning method that makes use of a binary classier to solve the answer validation. In our approach we can distinguish two processes applied to this classier: training and classication.</p><p>In the training process we have extracted several features for all the used training collections<ref type="foot" coords="2,505.76,109.44,3.97,7.94" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Previous results have been evaluated using the existing entailment judgements of these collections, and ML parameters have been adjusted.</p><p>We have trained the classier obtaining a learned model that will be used later in the classication process.</p><p>In the classication process we also extract the same features used in the training process for each pair question-answer. The classication algorithm uses these features and the learned model obtained in the training process. This algorithm returns a boolean value (correct or incorrect) for each pair question-answer. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,240.84,207.18,4.98,9.96" target="#fig_0">1</ref> describes the system architecture. The extracted features are related to the lexical similarity. In our experiments we have applied dierent lexical similarity measures. All these features are explained below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Lexical similarity</head><p>This experiment approaches the textual entailment task, based on the extraction of a set of lexical measures, that check the existing similarity between the hypothesis-text pairs. Our approach is similar to <ref type="bibr" coords="2,136.82,632.51,10.51,9.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref> but the matching between pairs of words is relaxed by using the Lin's similarity measure <ref type="bibr" coords="2,122.20,644.46,13.80,9.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> through Wordnet hierarchy. More concisely, we have applied simple matching, Binary Matching and Consecutive Subsequence Matching. In this task we have considered the answers as hypotheses and questions as texts.</p><p>Before the calculation of the dierent measures, the rst step was to preprocess the pairs using the English stopwords list. Then, we have used the GATE<ref type="foot" coords="2,350.61,690.19,3.97,7.94" target="#foot_1">2</ref> architecture to obtain the stems of tokens. Once the stems have been obtained, we have applied four dierent measures or techniques:</p><p>• Simple Matching: this technique calculates the semantic distance between the stems of each question and its answer. If the distance exceeds a threshold, both stems are considered similar and the similarity weight value increases in one. The accumulated weight is normalized dividing it by the number of terms of the answer (hypothesis). In this experiment we have considered the threshold 0.5. The values of semantic distance measure range from 0 to 1. In order to calculate the semantic distance between two stems, we have tried several measures based on WordNet <ref type="bibr" coords="3,241.53,183.26,9.96,9.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Lin's similarity measure <ref type="bibr" coords="3,382.27,183.26,10.51,9.96" target="#b4">[5]</ref> was shown to be best overall measures. It uses the notion of information content and the same elements as Jiang and Conrath's approach <ref type="bibr" coords="3,203.83,207.18,10.51,9.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref> but in a dierent fashion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,236.42,224.62,153.88,24.93">sim L (c 1 , c 2 ) = 2 × log p(lso(c 1 , c 2 )) log p(c 1 ) + log p(c 2 )</formula><p>where c 1 and c 2 are synsets, lso(c 1 ,c 2 ) is the information content of their lowest superordinate (most specic common subsumer) and p(c) is the probability of encountering an instance of a synset c in some specic corpus <ref type="bibr" coords="3,313.14,281.54,9.96,9.96" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The Simple Matching technique is dened in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="3,235.43,310.38,155.86,24.69">SIM matching = i∈H similarity(i) |H|</formula><p>where H is the set that contains the elements of the answer (hypothesis) and similarity(i) is dened like:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="3,212.42,365.53,196.89,20.87">similarity(i) = 1 if ∃j ∈ T simL(i, j) &gt; 0.5 0 otherwise</formula><p>• Binary Matching: this measure is the same that the previous one, but modifying the similarity function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="3,228.68,417.53,163.80,22.91">similarity(i) = 1 if ∃j ∈ T i = j 0 otherwise</formula><p>• Consecutive Subsequence Matching: this technique relies on forming subsequences of consecutive stems in the answer (hypothesis) and matching them in the question (text).</p><p>The minimal size of the consecutive subsequences is two, and the maximum is the maximum size of the answer. Every correct matching increases in one the nal weight. The sum of the obtained weights of the matching between subsequences of a certain size or length is normalized by the number of sets of consecutive subsequences of the answer created for this length. These weights are accumulated and normalized by the size of the answer less one. The Consecutive Subsequence Matching technique is dened in the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="3,249.52,550.79,127.67,26.63">CSS matching = |H| i=2 f (SH i ) |H| -1</formula><p>where SH i is the set that contains the subsequences of the answer with i size or length and f(SH i ) is dened like:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="3,244.48,607.70,137.76,25.53">f (SH i ) = j∈SH i matching(j) |H| -i + 1</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6" coords="3,224.71,646.97,171.74,22.91">matching(i) = 1 if ∃k ∈ ST i k = j 0 otherwise</formula><p>where ST i represents the set that contains the subsequences with i size from question (text).</p><p>• Trigrams: this technique relies on forming trigrams of words in the answer and matching them in the question. If an answer trigram matches in question, then the similarity weight value increases in one. The accumulated weight is normalized dividing it by the number of trigrams of the answer. The algorithms used in the experiments as binary classiers are two: Bayesian Logistic Regression (BBR) 3 and TiMBL <ref type="bibr" coords="4,182.29,229.02,9.96,9.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Both algorithms have been trained with the devel data provided by the organization of the Pascal challenge (RTE-3) and the AVE task of CLEF.</p><p>As it has been explained in previous sections, a model is generated via the supervised learning process. This model is used by the classication algorithm, which will decide whether an answer is entailed by the given snippet or not.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,132.33,288.79,4.98,9.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows two ocial results: where:</p><p>• Exp1 uses three features: three lexical similarities (SIM matching + CSS matching + Trigrams). The model has been trained using the devel data provided by the organization of the Pascal challenge, RTE-3, and the ML method used was BBR. comparison.</p><p>• Exp2 uses the same three features. The model has been trained using the devel data provided by the organization of the Answer Validation Exercise task, AVE-2007, and the devel data provided by the organization of the Pascal challenge, RTE-3. The ML method used was TiMBL.</p><p>As we expected, the best result is obtained by means of the use of both devel collections, RTE-3 and AVE-2007, and the use of TiMBL. We have to investigate why both results are too dierent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future work</head><p>In spite of the simplicity of the approach, we have obtained remarkable results: each set of features has reported relevant information, concerning to the entailment judgement determination. Our experiments approach the textual entailment task being based on the extraction of a set of lexical measures that show the existing similarity between the hypothesis-text pairs.</p><p>We have applied simple matching, Binary Matching and Consecutive Subsequence Matching, but the matching between pairs of words is relaxed by using the Lin's similarity measure through Wordnet hierarchy.</p><p>Finally, we want to implement a hierarchical architecture based on constraint satisfaction networks. The constraints will be given by the set of available features and the maintenance of the integrity across the semantic interpretation process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,236.49,526.46,130.04,9.96;2,74.72,228.43,453.69,283.58"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: System architecture</figDesc><graphic coords="2,74.72,228.43,453.69,283.58" type="bitmap" /></figure>
