<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper presents the participation of the XLDB Group from the University of Lisbon at the 2007 Geo-CLEF task. We experimented novel strategies for geographic query expansion, text mining, relevance feedback and geographic score metrics in a renewed GIR system. The motivation for this work derived from the results obtained in last year's participation, which revealed limitations on our previous GIR model <ref type="bibr" coords="1,497.75,591.40,10.81,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>:</p><p>• We focused on capturing and handling placenames and associated features from queries and documents for our geographic reasoning, and ignored important geographic information, such as spatial relationships and feature types. Feature types, such as cities, mountains or airports, play an important role on the definition of the geographic relevance criteria of queries. GeoCLEF topics also convey this idea: 13 out of the 25 topics of the Portuguese subtask of the 2007 edition of GeoCLEF contained feature types on the topic's title.</p><p>• Typical GeoIR systems rely on text mining methods to capture and disambiguate geonames present in the text, so that geographic scopes can be inferred for each document. These methods typically involve geoname grounding into geographic concepts included in a geographic ontology, and disambiguation of hard cases through reasoning based on other geonames extracted from the text <ref type="bibr" coords="1,477.83,728.80,15.34,8.97" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. We used this text mining approach in our past GeoCLEF participations <ref type="bibr" coords="1,387.24,740.80,10.77,8.97" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,400.80,740.80,7.26,8.97" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The mining process was finalized by a graph-ranking algorithm, that analysed the captured features and assigned one single encompassing scope per document <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.48,124.00,15.34,8.97" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This strategy is derived from the «one scope per discourse» assumption <ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.32,135.88,10.60,8.97" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, spanned to a full document. The assumption of taking the unit of discourse to the document level revealed to be too restrictive in some cases, and highly vulnerable to incorrectly assigned scopes. We observe that generic scopes were being assigned to documents with geonames that do not correspond to adjacent areas. For example, a document describing a football match between Portugal and Hungary, may have the common ancestor node (Europe) as a very strong candidate final scope.</p><p>This year, we decided to challenge some of the underlying assumptions of the GIR model used in the previous year, and tested a new approach. We introduced significant changes in the assembled GIR system, both on the query and on the document sides, to see if they could effectively tackle the limitations detected on the past GIR system. The improvements have been introduced at three levels:</p><p>Query Processing: We have rebuilt the query processing modules so that all geographic information present on a query is captured and subject to proper geographic query expansion. We gave special attention to feature types and spatial relationships, as guides for the geographic query expansion <ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.87,303.04,10.69,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Text Mining:</head><p>We decided to narrow the discourse context to the sentence level. We now generate what we call a geographic signature for each document, which is a list of geographic concepts that characterize a document, allowing each document to have several geographic contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Geographic Ranking:</head><p>As the new text mining approach generates a geographic signature for each document (D Sig ), and the geographic query expansion module generates a geographic signature for the query (Q Sig ), the geographic ranking step now has the burden of evaluating relevance considering queries and documents that contain multiple geographic concepts as a scope. In 2006, our similarity metric compared the (single) scope of a document against the (single) scope of a query. This year, we had to handle each of the features in the geographic signatures as part of a scope and compute a metric accounting for all concepts in the geographic signatures. We made some preliminary experiments to assess new combination metrics for computing relevance based on geographic signatures.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 depics our assembled GIR system, and describes in detail each module of our prototype. Section 3 presents our experiments and Section 4 analyses the results. Section 5 ends the paper with conclusions and directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">System Description</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,118.56,567.04,4.98,8.97">1</ref> presents the architecture of the GIR system assembled for GeoCLEF 2007. The GeoCLEF topics are automatically parsed by QueOnde and converted into &lt;what, spatial relationship, where&gt; triplets. The QuerCol module performs term and geographic query expansion, producing query strings consisting of query terms and a query geographic signature (Q Sig ).</p><p>CLEF documents are loaded into a repository, becoming available to all modules. Faísca is a text mining module specially crafted to extract and disambiguate geonames, generating geographic signatures for each document (D Sig ). Sidra5, our index and ranking module, generates text indexes from the documents and geographic indexes from their geographic signatures. Sidra5 also receives the queries generated by QuerCol as input, and generates final GeoCLEF runs in the trec_eval format. All these components rely on a geographic ontology for geographic reasoning, created using our own geographic knowledge base, GKB <ref type="bibr" coords="2,113.52,686.68,10.60,8.97" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Geographic Ontology</head><p>The geographic ontology is a central component of our GIR system, providing support for geographic reasoning for all modules. It models both geographic concepts and the relationships between concepts in  an hierarchical scheme. The geographic data come from several public sources, and include names for places and other geographic features, feature types, adjectives, relationships between concepts (adjacent and part-of ), demographic data, spatial coordinates and bounding boxes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,379.91,499.36,10.60,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The improvements made to the ontology for this year's participation were twofold: i) update of the GKB conceptual model to directly support multilingual names for geographic references, and ii) the addition of new features that we found missing after inspecting the GeoCLEF topics for 2007. The GKB 2.0 model now supports relationships between feature types, a better property assignment for features and feature types, and a better control of information sources <ref type="bibr" coords="3,294.24,559.12,10.60,8.97" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Most of the ontology enrichment was carried out in the physical domain, with the addition of new feature types like airports, circuits and mountains, along with their instances in the GKB. Table <ref type="table" coords="3,245.28,583.00,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the statistics of the ontology used in the evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">QueOnde Query Parser and QuerCol Query Expansion</head><p>On the query side, we developed a new geographic query parsing module, QueOnde. The geographic query expansion module, QuerCol, introduced for last year's participation <ref type="bibr" coords="3,361.08,642.16,10.77,8.97" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,374.28,642.16,7.18,8.97" target="#b8">9]</ref>, was improved for also handling feature types and spatial relationships.</p><p>QueOnde automatically converts GeoCLEF topic titles into &lt;what, spatial relationship, where&gt; triplets with the help of the geographic ontology and a set of manually-crafted context rules for capturing and disambiguating spatial relationships, features and feature types. QueOnde also participated on the 2007 GeoCLEF Query Parsing subtask <ref type="bibr" coords="3,225.48,701.92,15.24,8.97" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The QuerCol module is able to expand the thematic (what) and the geographic (where) parts of a query separately. The what is expanded through blind relevance feedback (RF) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,379.44,725.92,15.34,8.97" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, while the where is expanded by a new algorithm, which decides the geographic expansion strategy to be performed based on features and feature types present on a query <ref type="bibr" coords="4,236.40,124.00,10.60,8.97" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>When feature types are present in the query, they may mean two things: i) the user is disambiguating the geoname, because it can be associated to other geographic concepts (e.g., City of Budapest and Budapest Airport); or ii) the user is designating a set of concepts as a scope of interest (e.g., Airports of Hungary). In case i), the feature type is disambiguating the geographic concept given by the feature Budapest as the scope of interest, while in case ii), the feature type is designating a group of geographic concepts of the scopes of interest, requiring additional geographic reasoning to obtain the corresponding concepts.</p><p>The geographic query expansion step of our GIR system is now guided according to the spatial relationship, features or feature types specified on the query. For instance, in the CLEF topic #74, Ship traffic around Portuguese islands, QuerCol considers in as the spatial relationship, Portugal as a feature name and islands as a feature type, and it reasons that the scope of interest is all geographic concepts of type island that are part of Portugal: São Miguel, Santa Maria, Formigas, Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge, Pico, Faial, Flores, Corvo, Madeira, Porto Santo, Desertas and Selvagens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Faísca</head><p>The text mining module Faísca parses the documents for geonames, generating geographic signatures for each document. Faísca relies on pattern matching from a gazetteer generated from the geographic ontology, containing all concepts represented by their names and respective feature types. Consider the following (fictional) example for the geoname Lisbon, which is associated to multiple geographic concepts in the ontology. The gazetteer would have the following pattern entries: The left size of these entries contains the text patterns to be matched, in [&lt;feature type&gt; $ &lt;feature&gt;] and in [&lt;feature&gt; &lt;feature type&gt;] formats (being the former one more common for Portuguese texts, and the latter one for English texts), while on the right side there is an identifier of the corresponding geographic concept in the ontology. The character $ means that an arbitrary term or group of terms is allowed to be present between the feature and the feature type, in order to avoid different stopword and adjective patterns. This approach immediately captures and grounds all geonames into their unique concept identifiers, without depending on hard-coded disambiguation rules. In the end, we have a catch-all pattern, which is used when the geoname found in the document does not contain any kind of external hints on its feature type. For these cases, we assign all identifiers of geographic concepts that are associated with the geoname Lisbon.</p><p>The geographic signatures (D Sig ) generated by Faísca consist on a list of concept identifiers and a corresponding confidence measure (Con f Meas) normalized to [0,1], that represents the confidence that the feature is part of the document scope. Con f Meas is obtained through an analysis of the surrounding concepts on each case, in a similar way as described by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,346.07,614.44,10.60,8.97" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Geonames on a text are considered as qualifying expressions of a geographic concept when a direct ontology relationship between the geonames is also observed. For example, the geoname Adelaide receives an higher Con f Meas value on the document signature if an ontologically related concept, such as Australia, is nearby on the text. If so, the feature Australia is not included in the D Sig , because it is assumed that it was used to disambiguate Australia, the more specific concept. An excerpt of four document signatures (one per line) as generated by Faísca from the GeoCLEF collection is given below:  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Sidra5</head><p>Sidra5 is a text indexing and ranking module with geographic capabilities based on Managing Gigabytes for Java (MG4J) <ref type="bibr" coords="5,158.64,304.72,10.60,8.97" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It uses a standard inverted term index provided by MG4J, and a geographic forward index of [docid, D Sig ] that maps the id of a document to the corresponding D Sig generated by Faísca.</p><p>To retrieve documents, Sidra5 first uses the what part of the query and the term index to retrieve the top 1000 documents. Afterwards, the D Sig of each document is retrieved with the help of the geographic index. Finally, the document score is obtained by combining the Okapi BM25 text score <ref type="bibr" coords="5,414.95,352.60,15.34,8.97" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, normalized to [0,1] (NormBM25) as defined by Song et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,249.00,364.60,15.24,8.97" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and a geographic score normalized to [0,1] (GeoScore) with equal weights:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,174.36,405.69,338.72,21.51">Ranking(query, doc) = 0.5 × NormBM25(query, doc) + 0.5 × GeoScore(query, doc)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The calculation of GeoScore begins with the computation of the geographic similarity GeoSim for each pair (s 1 , s 2 ), where s 1 in Q Sig and s 2 in D Sig , through a weighted sum of four heuristic measures (discussed in our 2006 GeoCLEF participation <ref type="bibr" coords="5,239.40,462.04,10.66,8.97" target="#b8">[9]</ref>): Ontology (OntSim), Distance (DistSim), Adjacency (Ad jSim) and Population (PopSim) similarity measures.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1" coords="5,175.80,503.13,337.28,25.39">GeoSim(s 1 , s 2 ) =0.5 × OntSim(s 1 , s 2 ) + 0.2 × DistSim(s 1 , s 2 )+ 0.2 × PopSim(s 1 , s 2 ) + 0.1 × Ad jSim(s 1 , s 2 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Having geographic signatures with multiple concepts requires adding aggregation metrics to GeoScore for handling the different GeoSim values that a (query, doc) pair can generate. We experimented four metrics: Maximum, Mean, Boolean and Null.</p><p>Maximum: GeoScore is the maximum GeoSim value computed between a (query, doc) pair.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2" coords="5,122.64,602.73,390.44,10.51">GeoScore Maximum (query, doc) = max (GeoSim(s 1 , s 2 ) × Con f Meas(s 2 )) , s 1 ∈ Q sig ∧ s 2 ∈ D sig (3)</formula><p>Mean: GeoScore is the average GeoSim values computed between a (query, doc) pair.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3" coords="5,130.20,647.25,378.97,10.51">GeoScore Mean (query, doc) = avg (GeoSim(s 1 , s 2 ) × Con f Meas(s 2 )) , s 1 ∈ Q sig ∧ s 2 ∈ D sig (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4" coords="5,509.17,647.92,3.91,8.97">)</formula><p>Boolean: GeoScore equals 1 if there is a commom concept in a (query, doc) pair, and equals 0 otherwise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5" coords="5,171.48,693.69,341.60,24.03">GeoScore Boolean (query, doc) = 1 if ∃ s 1 = s 2 , s 1 ∈ Q sig ∧ s 2 ∈ D sig 0 otherwise (5)</formula><p>Null: GeoScore Null is always 0, turning off the geographic scores. This is used as a baseline metric for comparing results obtained with the other metrics. The computation of the four GeoScore metrics is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,378.48,207.88,3.77,8.97" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, which presents a fictional query (Hungary), and two document surrogates, along with the GeoSim × Con f Meas values and final GeoScore values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Runs</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="6,114.48,287.68,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarises the submitted runs, a total of 10: five on the Portuguese monolingual subtask and five on the English monolingual subtask. Our runs aimed to:</p><p>• evaluate if the current GeoIR approach of treating geonames in a separate geographic ranking obtains better results than treating geonames as terms in a standard IR approach;</p><p>• determine which GeoScore combination metrics is best. We experimented the GeoScore Mean and GeoScore Maximum on our runs. The GeoScore Boolean and GeoScore Null metrics were later included in post-hoc experiments;</p><p>• measure the importance of the geographic query expansion before or after the relevance feedback step.</p><p>We generated initial queries from the topic titles to obtain initial runs for the RF. We used 32 top-k terms and 20 top-k documents as parameters for the blind relevance feedback <ref type="bibr" coords="6,406.68,438.76,10.60,8.97" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The final query string combines expansion terms by aggregating semantically related concepts with the help of the MG4J logic operators, following the suggestions of Mitra et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,294.00,462.64,15.24,8.97" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and the concept identifiers from the Q Sig .</p><p>The Terms only experiment (run 1) uses early geographic reasoning to generate a Q Sig . Yet, it uses the names of geographic concepts as standard terms in the generation of the initial and final runs, meaning that this run uses only classical text retrieval.</p><p>The other runs use the text and geographic scores for ranking documents: Geographic QE before RF experiments (runs 2 and 3) considers the Q Sig as the where part of the initial query, for initial run and final run generation, while the Geographic QE after RF experiments (runs 4 and 5) use only the captured concepts on the topic title as the where part for the initial run generation, and the Q Sig on the final run generation. The Terms/GIR runs on these experiments differ by the use of the initial run generated in the Terms only experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>Unfortunately, the runs submitted to GeoCLEF were hampered by programming errors in our GIR prototype, and so the obtained poor MAP values did not allow us to draw any early conclusions regarding our experiments. After some code revision, we managed to obtain more significative MAP values and conducted additional experiments with the fixed GIR prototype. The MAP values presented on Table <ref type="table" coords="6,486.36,661.96,4.98,8.97" target="#tab_4">3</ref> refer only to the post-hoc experiments.</p><p>We observed that the GeoScore Mean produces poor MAP values, because long document signatures tend to cause query drifting. GeoScore Maximum and GeoScore Boolean revealed to be much more robust, and the GeoScore Boolean metric has the best MAP values for Portuguese. This is explained in part because the GeoScore Maximum is highly dependent on the heuristics used, and these are dependent on the quality of the geographic signatures and the quality of the ontology, while the GeoScore Boolean metric is more straightforward on assigning maximum scores for geographically relevant documents. This difference also  means that there are more irrelevant documents that are being scored higher than relevant documents being scored lower by the GeoScore Maximum .</p><p>Regarding the geographic query expansion before or after the RF, we found that early geographic expansion results in a better generation of initial runs (0.126 versus 0.084), meaning that more relevant documents are present on the top-k docs, thus improving the results from the RF step.</p><p>Using geonames as terms on the term index instead of geographic concepts still gets better results in the initial run (0.210 versus 0.126). The final run obtained without performing geographic ranking improves the MAP value to 0.233. We were intrigued with the consistent better results obtained with the Terms Only experiment. The good MAP value obtained by its initial run (0.210) suggested an experiment with this initial run, followed by a term and geographic expansion to generate a final query with a geographic signature, and ending in a GIR retrieval just like the other experiments. This Terms/GIR experiment obtained an MAP of 0.268 for the GeoScore Boolean metric, the highest MAP value of our post-hoc experiments.</p><p>Regarding the English experiments, we observe similar trends as in the Portuguese experiments. The slightly lower values are consequence of the quality of the ontology, which is more complete with Portuguese feature names. Also, we observe that the GeoScore Maximum outperformed the GeoScore Boolean geoscope values for the Terms/GIR experiment, which prompt us to make further analysis on the meaning of the observed differences between these two metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>This year's participation was a deception in terms of results for official runs, but we accept it as the consequence of deciding to develop a totally renewed and untested GIR system. Yet, the post-hoc experiments drew some interesting results for understanding why the GIR approaches are still outperformed by classic IR approaches. Our Terms/GIR experiments manage to obtain the highest MAP values, which might shed some light on this problem and suggest that there may be more efficient ways to introduce geographic reasoning in a GIR system.</p><p>The approaches of this year and last year's participations are both very dependent of the quality of the geographic ontology. 25% of the relevant documents contained geonames that were not in our ontology, and we found that we have poor results when handling queries with unknown geonames. In addition, the ontology is not comprehensive on coordinates and population data to serve the geographic heuristics. We need to make further experiments with a more complete ontology, in order to better evaluate the fitness of the geographic similarities.</p><p>We also believe that our results could be improved with a more robust term query expansion module, as the current query expansion through blind relevance feedback is basic and does not produce significant improvements. We are also aware that some of the blame may be on the query construction step, as the readaptation for the MG4J syntax was overlooked. Our post-hoc experiments used RF parameters of eight top-k terms and five top-k docs, and used different logic operations for query construction. These changes resulted in significant improvement of the results, showing that we still have some tuning to do in the term query expansion step.</p><p>Finally, we conclude that this new GIR approach has its merits, and may be further improved to produce good results. Yet, it is still on its early steps, so our next work is to mature the approaches and develop a stable GIR prototype for further experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,156.12,280.72,291.08,8.97;3,195.84,294.52,68.46,8.97;3,351.36,294.52,94.02,8.97;3,139.32,306.88,24.42,8.97;3,190.68,306.88,41.26,8.97;3,315.72,306.88,38.86,8.97;3,443.76,306.88,20.10,8.97;3,139.32,318.88,29.53,8.97;3,190.68,318.88,65.77,8.97;3,315.72,318.88,65.22,8.97;3,443.76,318.88,20.10,8.97;3,139.32,330.76,21.80,8.97;3,195.60,330.76,47.46,8.97;3,315.72,330.76,111.18,8.97;3,443.76,330.76,20.10,8.97;3,139.32,342.76,38.94,8.97;3,195.60,342.76,88.66,8.97;3,315.72,342.76,77.94,8.97;3,448.68,342.76,15.06,8.97;3,139.32,354.76,19.90,8.97;3,195.60,354.76,43.57,8.97;3,315.72,354.76,65.22,8.97;3,448.68,354.76,15.06,8.97;3,139.32,366.64,27.73,8.97;3,195.60,366.64,55.33,8.97;3,315.72,366.64,63.54,8.97;3,448.68,366.64,15.06,8.97;3,139.32,378.64,28.74,8.97;3,195.60,378.64,46.93,8.97;3,315.72,378.64,39.13,8.97;3,438.72,378.64,25.14,8.97;3,139.32,390.52,39.49,8.97;3,200.64,390.52,38.77,8.97;3,305.76,390.52,15.06,8.97;3,139.32,402.88,27.76,8.97;3,296.16,402.88,75.75,8.97;3,443.76,402.88,20.10,8.97;3,139.32,414.88,33.88,8.97;3,296.16,414.88,102.03,8.97;3,443.76,414.88,20.10,8.97;3,139.32,426.88,56.07,8.97;3,311.16,426.88,109.95,8.97;3,438.72,426.88,25.14,8.97;3,333.00,438.76,82.84,8.97;3,438.72,438.76,25.14,8.97"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Architecture of the GIR system assembled for GeoCLEF 2007.Physical Domain Administrative Domain Island 205 Sea 5 Place 4023 Airport 107 Cathedral 3 ISO-3166-2 3976 River 86 Ocean 2 Administrative division 3212 Mountain 85 Mountain Range 2 Agglomeration 751 Lake 66 Strait 1 ISO-3166-1 239 Circuit 63 Channel 1 Capital city 233 Region 23 Planet 1 Total 12434 Continent 7 Total 657 Names 14408 Centroids 4204 Features 13091 Bounding boxes 2083 Feature Types 21 adjacent relationships 11307 part-of relationships 13762</figDesc></figure>
