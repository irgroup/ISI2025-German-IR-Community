<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum 1 is to promote research in the field of multilingual system development. This is done through the organisation of annual evaluation campaigns in which a series of tracks designed to test different aspects of mono-and cross-language information retrieval (IR) are offered. The intention is to encourage experimentation with all kinds of multilingual information access -from the development of systems for monolingual retrieval operating on many languages to the implementation of complete multilingual multimedia search services. This has been achieved by offering an increasingly complex and varied set of evaluation tasks over the years. The aim is not only to meet but also to anticipate the emerging needs of the R&amp;D community and to encourage the development of next generation multilingual IR systems. These Working Notes contain descriptions of the experiments conducted within CLEF 2007 -the eighth in a series of annual system evaluation campaigns. The results of the experiments will be presented and discussed in the CLEF 2007 Workshop, 19-21 September, Budapest, Hungary. The final papers -revised and extended as a result of the discussions at the Workshop -together with a comparative analysis of the results will appear in the CLEF 2007 Proceedings, to be published by Springer in their Lecture Notes for Computer Science series. As from CLEF 2005, the Working Notes are published in electronic format only and are distributed to participants at the Workshop on CD-ROM together with the Book of Abstracts in printed form. All reports included in the Working Notes will also be inserted in the DELOS Digital Library, accessible at http://delos-dl.isti.cnr.it. Both Working Notes and Book of Abstracts are divided into eight sections, corresponding to the CLEF 2007 evaluation tracks, plus an additional section describing other evaluation initiatives using CLEF data: MorphoChallenge 2007 and SemEval 2007. In addition appendices are included containing run statistics for the Ad Hoc, Domain-Specific, GeoCLEF and CL-SR tracks, plus a list of all participating groups showing in which track they took part. The main features of the 2007 campaign are briefly outlined here below in order to provide the necessary background to the experiments reported in the rest of the Working Notes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Tracks and Tasks in CLEF 2007</head><p>CLEF 2007 offered seven tracks designed to evaluate the performance of systems for:</p><p>• mono-, bi-and multilingual textual document retrieval on news collections (Ad Hoc)</p><p>• mono-and cross-language information on structured scientific data (Domain-Specific) • multiple language question answering (QA@CLEF) • cross-language retrieval in image collections (ImageCLEF) • cross-language speech retrieval (CL-SR)</p><p>• multilingual retrieval of Web documents (WebCLEF) • cross-language geographical retrieval (GeoCLEF) These tracks are mainly the same as those offered in CLEF2006 with the exclusion of an interactive track<ref type="foot" coords="1,518.64,621.85,3.24,5.65" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , however many of the tasks offered are new.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Text Retrieval (Ad Hoc):</head><p>This year, this track offered monoand bilingual tasks on target collections for central European languages (Bulgarian, Czech<ref type="foot" coords="2,318.18,82.81,3.24,5.65" target="#foot_2">3</ref> and Hungarian). Similarly to last year, a bilingual task encouraging system testing with non-European languages against English documents was offered. Topics were made available in Amharic, Chinese, Oromo and Indonesian. A special sub-task regarded Indian language search against an English target collection was also organised with the assistance of a number of Indian research institutes, responsible for the preparation of the topics. The languages offered were Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Marathi. In order to establish benchmarks in this subtask, all participating groups has to submit:</p><p>-one monolingual English to English run (mandatory) -at least one run in Hindi to English (mandatory) -runs in other Indian languages to English (optional). A "robust" task was again be offered, emphasizing the importance of reaching a minimal performance for all topics instead of high average performance. Robustness is a key issue for the transfer of CLEF research into applications. The 2007 robust task involved three languages often used in previous CLEF campaigns (English, French, Portuguese). The track was coordinated jointly by ISTI-CNR and U.Padua (Italy) and U.Hildesheim (Germany).</p><p>Cross-Language Scientific Data Retrieval (Domain-Specific): Mono-and cross-language domain-specific retrieval was studied in the domain of social sciences using structured data (e.g. bibliographic data, keywords, and abstracts) from scientific reference databases. The target collections provided were: GIRT-4 for German/English, INION for Russian and Cambridge Sociological Abstracts for English. A multi-lingual controlled vocabulary (German, English, Russian) suitable for use with GIRT-4 and INION together with a bi-directional mapping between this vocabulary and that used for indexing the Sociological Abstracts (English) was provided. Topics were offered in English, German and Russian. This track was coordinated by IZ Bonn (Germany).</p><p>Multilingual Question Answering (QA@CLEF): QA@CLEF 2007 proposed both main and pilot tasks. The main task scenario was topic-related QA, where the questions are grouped by topics and may contain anaphoric references one to the others. The answers were retrieved from heterogeneous document collections, i.e. news articles and Wikipedia. Many sub-tasks were set up, monolingual -where the questions and the target collections searched for answers are in the same language -and bilingual -where source and target languages are different. Bulgarian, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish were offered as target languages; query languages used in the bilingual tasks depended on demand (see the track overview for details). Following the positive response at QA@CLEF 2006, the Answer Validation Exercise (AVE) was reproposed. A new pilot tasks was also offered: Question Answering on Speech Transcript (QAst), in which the answers to factual questions have to be extracted from spontaneous speech transcriptions (manual and automatic transcriptions) coming from different human interaction scenario. The track is organized by several institutions (one for each source language) and jointly coordinated by CELCT, Trento (Italy), LSI-UNED, Madrid and UPC, Barcelona (Spain).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Retrieval in Image Collections (ImageCLEF):</head><p>This track evaluated retrieval of images described by text captions in several languages; both text and image retrieval techniques were exploitable. Four challenging tasks were offered: (i) multilingual ad-hoc retrieval (collection with mixed English/German/Spanish annotations, queries in more languages), (ii) medical image retrieval (casenotes in English/ French/German; visual, mixed, semantic queries in same languages), (iii) hierarchical automatic image annotation for medical images (fully categorized in English and German, purely visual task), (iv) photographic annotation through detection of objects in images (using the same collection as (i) with a restricted number of objects, a purely visual task). Image retrieval was not required for all tasks and a default visual and textual retrieval system was made available for participants. The track coordinators were U.Sheffield (UK) and the U. and U. Hospitals of Geneva (Switzerland). Oregon Health and Science U. (US), Victoria U., Melbourne (Australia), RWTH Achen (Germany) and Vienna Univ. Tech (Austria) collaborated in the task organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR):</head><p>The focus is on searching spontaneous speech from oral history interviews rather than news broadcasts. The test collection created for the track is a subset of a large archive of videotaped oral histories from survivors, liberators, rescuers and witnesses of the Holocaust created by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation (VHF). Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and both automatically assigned and manually assigned thesaurus terms were available as part of the collection. In 2006 the CL-SR track included search collections of conversational English and Czech speech using six languages (Czech, Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish). In CLEF 2007 additional topics were added for the Czech speech collection. Speech content is described by automatic speech transcriptions manually and automatically assigned controlled vocabulary descriptors for concepts, dates and locations, manually assigned </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross-Language Geographical Retrieval (GeoCLEF):</head><p>The purpose of GeoCLEF is to test and evacuate cross-language geographic information retrieval (GIR): retrieval for topics with a geographic specification. GeoCLEF 2007 consisted of two sub tasks. A search task ran for the third time and a query classification task was organized for the first. For the GeoCLEF 2007 search task, twenty-five search topics were defined by the organizing groups for searching English, German, Portuguese and Spanish document collections. Topics were translated into English, German and Spanish. For the classification task, a query log from a search engine was provided and the groups needed to identify the queries with a geographic scope and the geographic components within the local queries. The track was coordinated jointly by UC Berkeley (USA), U.Sheffield (UK), U. Hildesheim (Germany), Linguateca SINTEF (Norway), Microsoft Asia (China).</p><p>Details on the technical infrastructure and the organisation of these tracks can be found in the track overview reports in this volume, collocated at the beginning of the relevant sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Test Collections</head><p>A number of different document collections were used in CLEF 2007 to build the test collections:</p><p>• CLEF multilingual comparable corpus of more than 3 million news documents in 13 languages; new data was added this year for Czech, Bulkagarian and English (see Table <ref type="table" coords="3,376.26,351.33,3.73,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref>); Parts of this collections were used in the Ad-Hoc, QuestionAnswering, and GeoCLEF tracks.</p><p>• The GIRT-4 social science database in English and German (over 300,000 documents) and two Russian databases: the Russian Social Science Corpus (approx. 95,000 documents) and the Russian ISISS collection for sociology and economics (approx. 150,000 docs). The RSSC corpus was not used this year. Cambridge Sociological Abstracts in English. These collections were used in the domain-specific track.</p><p>• The ImageCLEF track used collections for both general photographic and medical image retrieval:</p><p>IAPR TC-12 photo database of 25,000 photographs with captions in English, German and Spanish; PASCAL VOC 2006 training data (new this year); ImageCLEFmed radiological database consisting of 6 distinct datasets -2 more than last year; IRMA collection in English and German of 12,000 classified images for automatic medical image annotation</p><p>• Malach collection of spontaneous conversational speech derived from the Shoah archives in English (more than 750 hours) and Czech (approx 500 hours). This collection was used in the speech retrieval track.</p><p>• EuroGOV, a multilingual collection of about 3.5M webpages, containing documents many languages crawled from European governmental sites, used in the WebCLEF track.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Technical Infrastructure</head><p>The CLEF technical infrastructure is managed by the DIRECT system. DIRECT manages the test data plus results submission and analyses for the ad hoc, question answering and geographic IR tracks. It has been designed to facilitate data management tasks but also to support the production, maintenance, enrichment and interpretation of the scientific data for subsequent in-depth evaluation studies.</p><p>The technical infrastructure is thus responsible for:</p><p>• the track set-up, harvesting of documents, management of the registration of participants to tracks;</p><p>• the submission of experiments, collection of metadata about experiments, and their validation;</p><p>• the creation of document pools and the management of relevance assessment;</p><p>• the provision of common statistical analysis tools for both organizers and participants in order to allow the comparison of the experiments;</p><p>• the provision of common tools for summarizing, producing reports and graphs on the measured performances and conducted analyses.</p><p>DIRECT is designed and implemented by Giorgio Di Nunzio and Nicola Ferro  Europe, 14(14.5) from N.America; 14(10) from Asia, 1(4) from S.America and 1(1) from Australia. The breakdown of participation of groups per track is as follows: Ad Hoc 22(25); Domain-Specific 5(4); QAatCLEF 28(37); ImageCLEF 35(25); CL-SR 8(6); WebCLEF 4(8); GeoCLEF 13(17) 5 . A list of groups and indications of the tracks in which they participated is given in the Appendix to these Working Notes. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,440.43,701.97,5.01,8.74">1</ref> shows the variation in participation over the years and Figure <ref type="figure" coords="5,238.35,713.49,5.01,8.74">2</ref> shows the shift in focus as new tracks have been added</p><p>5 Last year's figures are between brackets. In particular, these figures show that while there is a constant increase in interest in the ImageCLEF track, there is a consistent decrease in popularity of the question answering and web tracks. Although the fluctuation in QA does not seem to be of great significance -this is a very difficult task -the apparent lack of interest in WebCLEF is surprising. With the importance of Internet and web search engines, a larger participation in this task is to be expected. The large numbers for ImageCLEF also give rise to some discussion. The defining feature of CLEF is its multilinguality; ImageCLEF is perhaps the least multilingual of the CLEF tracks as much of the work is done in a language-independent context. These questions will be the subject of debate at the workshop. At the same time, it should be noted that these Working Notes also include reports from two separate evaluation initiatives which actually used CLEF data for certain tasks -thus the impact of CLEF spreads far beyond the boundaries of the CLEF evaluation campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Workshop</head><p>CLEF aims at creating a strong CLIR/MLIR research and development community. The Workshop plays an important role by providing the opportunity for all the groups that have participated in the evaluation campaign to get together comparing approaches and exchanging ideas. The work of the groups participating in this year's campaign will be presented in plenary paper and poster sessions. There will also be break-out sessions for more in-depth discussion of the results of individual tracks and intentions for the future. The final sessions will include discussions on ideas for new tracks in future campaigns. Overall, the Workshop should provide an ample panorama of the current state-of-the-art and the latest research directions in the multilingual information retrieval area. I very much hope that it will prove an interesting, worthwhile and enjoyable experience to all those who participate.</p><p>The final programme and the presentations at the Workshop will be posted on the CLEF website at http://www.clef-campaign.org.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,70.92,73.53,453.51,8.74;3,70.92,84.99,204.54,8.74;3,70.92,102.24,444.49,9.02;3,70.92,113.97,453.53,8.74;3,70.92,125.49,453.38,8.74;3,70.92,136.95,419.00,8.74;3,70.92,148.47,124.73,8.74"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>person names, and hand-written segment summaries.
