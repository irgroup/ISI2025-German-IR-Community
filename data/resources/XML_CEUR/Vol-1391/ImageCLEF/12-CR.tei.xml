<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Besides recognizing medical image modalities, such as Xrays, MRIs, histology images, fluorescence microscopy images, endoscopy images, photos, illustrations, etc., the detection of visual content is equally important. Once the main modality class is detected, a modality such as Xray can be broken to different sub-classes representing different body parts such as arms, legs, neck, torso, etc. Such a classification can further help the current image-based search engines to return appropriate results based on visual content similarity. For our participation in the ImageCLEF2015 Medical image clustering task, we implemented a classification scheme based on a neural network using two different feature collections -which proved their value in object recognition and chest X-ray analysis.</p></div>

Increased research interest has resulted in years long systematic evaluation efforts <ref type="foot" coords="1,257.70,519.81,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . One outcome of the evaluation was that knowing the modality of an image, i.e., whether it is an X-ray, CT, MRI or a photograph, radically improves the performance of image retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="1,374.09,545.29,15.50,8.74" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,389.58,545.29,11.62,8.74" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>This section describes the motivation for the particular feature sets in use, provides a brief description of the different features, and finally has a short section describing the classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Description of features</head><p>To characterize the different body parts in the X-ray images, we considered two different feature sets. Feature Set A is inspired from object detection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.53,152.19,11.09,8.74" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,446.62,152.19,11.09,8.74" target="#b11">12]</ref>, and was used with success in a previous work <ref type="bibr" coords="2,316.36,164.14,10.49,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to detect pulmonary abnormalities in frontal chest X-ray images. Feature Set B has been utilized with success in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,465.21,176.10,15.38,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for a medical CBIR system. These features cover a large number of properties, such as color distribution, edginess, texture, curvatures, pixel densities, shape, and other measures necessary to describe images such as in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="2,432.80,211.96,3.94,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We note that the body parts in the X-ray images appear in in different size, rotation, shape, etc. Therefore, features invariant to size and rotation or shape are most appropriate. Set A: Is a versatile and compact feature set combining shape, edge and texture descriptors. The final feature representation is built by concatenating the different descriptors (histograms) extracted from the segmented lung regions. In particular, in Set A, the following shape and texture descriptors were considered: Intensity Histogram (IH), Gradient Magnitude Histogram (GM), Shape Descriptor Histogram (SD), Curvature Descriptor Histogram (CD), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.78,331.58,10.03,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,410.22,331.58,14.69,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A modified multiscale approach proposed by Frangi et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,339.91,343.53,10.58,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is considered to compute the eigenvalues of Hessian matrix needed for the shape and curvature descriptors. The Hessian describes the second-order surface curvature properties of the local image intensity surface. The normalization makes these descriptors intensity invariant. In <ref type="bibr" coords="2,147.36,391.35,10.60,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref> we determined that quantizing these features into 32 bins provides good discrimination performance. The size of the feature descriptor is 192. Set B : Is a diversified, low-level feature collection involving intensity, edge, texture, color and shape moment features. The feature representation is built by concatenating the different descriptors (histograms) extracted from the segmented lung regions. In particular, the following descriptors were considered: Color Layout Descriptor (CLD), Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD) from MPEG-7 standard <ref type="bibr" coords="2,177.52,475.10,14.74,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, Color and Edge Direction Descriptor (CEDD) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,409.79,475.10,10.08,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Fuzzy Color and Texture Histogram (FCTH) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,280.90,487.06,10.59,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Tamura texture descriptor, Gabor texture feature <ref type="bibr" coords="2,168.54,499.01,10.02,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and other texture features such as primitive length, edge frequency, and autocorrelation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,223.65,510.97,14.61,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This feature set comprises 595 dimensions. Set C : Is a union of set A and set B. Even though some of the features are similar or similar characteristics, this extended feature collection can be a powerful descriptor for such particular type of X-ray images of different body parts, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,189.87,558.85,9.98,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Practically the features were stitched together to form a larger feature descriptor. The dimension of this feature descriptor is 787.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Feature classification</head><p>For classification a neural network-based classifier was used. Neural networks in particular are known for their capability of estimating complex decision surfaces <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,645.16,10.63,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and handling multi-class problems. Due to the large numbers of features to be handled (up to 787 dimensions), and the lack of information about the possible correlations among the different feature components, a fully connected multi-layer perceptron network was utilized. The number of neurons in the input layer was selected based on the dimensionality of the input feature vector. The number of output neurons was also set based on the possible outcomes: head-neck, upper-limb, body, and lower-limb, while the number of neurons in the hidden layer was estimated based on several trial runs. Finally, for the experiments 15 neurons were considered as being optimal in the hidden layer. For training error-backpropagation strategy was considered, while for learning rate = 0.004, and momentum = 0.3 were used. The different parameters were established based on several trial runs. For the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer, we considered the criteria to have as less possible neuron to keep the complexity low. Therefore, the recognition time became faster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>This section gives a brief description of the data followed by the description of the evaluation protocols, and the different results obtained by the neural classifier utilizing the different feature collections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data description</head><p>The data provided by the ImageCLEF2015 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.63,379.59,15.60,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Medical image clustering task organizers contains 500 X-ray images of variable sizes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.48,391.54,9.83,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The content of the image is equally distributed among X-rays containing head-neck, upper-limb, body, and lower-limb images. An equal number of 100 images of true negatives -containing completely different images, were also provided to help the researchers providing negative examples to their systems. Some images from the data collection are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,208.05,451.32,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For more details about the data, please refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="3,429.26,451.32,9.97,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Evaluation protocols</head><p>The accuracy (ACC) was measured to properly evaluate the performance of the method. Each of our experiments follows a 10x cross-validation protocol, and the reported results are the average scores of the different folds. However, the competition organizers used three different measures, namely the exact match, any match and the Hamming distance <ref type="bibr" coords="3,304.74,548.24,9.96,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Results</head><p>Using the previously mentioned feature set A, B and the C, three different experiments were conducted. The first results are presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="3,436.85,609.29,3.87,8.74">1</ref>.</p><p>One can observe the superiority of the Set C, which contains both features from set A and Set B, respectively. It is quite important to mention the fact, that color features such as CEDD, FCTH also contribute to the higher accuracy of the system, whilst, features such as intensity histogram, LBP and HOG, which 81.60 Table <ref type="table" coords="4,162.94,377.28,4.13,7.89">1</ref>.

The results shown in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,454.79,434.37,3.95,8.74">1</ref>. are reported using the 10x cross-validation protocol on the training samples (labels available) provided originally by the organizers.</p><p>The results reported in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,285.85,470.96,3.95,8.74">2</ref>. were generated based on the test set (no labels available) provided by the competition organizers. This image collection contains 250 samples, similar to the training material, equally distributed among the 5 classes. To train the neural network all data (500 samples) available in the training set were considered. Despite the usage of different metrics for evaluating the performance of this experiment, the rank among the features is preserved, as expected.  <ref type="table" coords="4,170.99,622.16,4.13,7.89">2</ref>. Results for the different features on the test sets using other metrics <ref type="bibr" coords="4,460.97,622.19,9.22,7.86" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we introduced three different feature sets (A, B and C) applied with sucess in pulmonary disease detection in chest X-ray images, and image retrieval and modality detection. It is interesting to note that features such as intensity histogram or histogram of oriented gradient or localy binary patterns among others belonging to set A were less effective than generic features such as Fuzzy Color and Texture histogram, Tamura texture feature, Gabor texture features, Edge histogram descriptor and Color Layout descriptor coming from feature set B. The combination of these features into a larger set C allowed us to classify quite effectively the different body parts from the X-ray images.</p><p>Among the 7 participants in the contest (see detailed description in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,451.29,250.14,10.87,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) we ended up on 4 th place, while among the 29 runs submitted by the different research groups, our runs finished at 11 th ,17 th , and 25 th , respectively.</p><p>To further improve the classification scores, we envision an exhaustive feature selection mechanism applied to the set C, to eliminate those features which are rotation variant such as HOG, and other feature components which do not contribute much to the final scores.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,204.83,309.88,205.68,7.89;4,213.78,208.34,59.52,62.36"><head>Fig. 1 .Feature</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
