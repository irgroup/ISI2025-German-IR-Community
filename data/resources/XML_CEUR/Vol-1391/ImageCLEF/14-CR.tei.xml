<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>This paper describes the modelling methods and experiments performed by the FHDO Biomedical Computer Science Group (BCSG) at the ImageCLEF 2015 medical classification. This is the first participation of the BCSG, a research group from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund, at the crosslanguage image retrieval track ImageCLEF <ref type="bibr" coords="1,326.95,627.66,15.50,8.74" target="#b27">[28]</ref> of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) <ref type="foot" coords="1,221.41,638.04,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">1</ref> .</p><p>The ImageCLEF 2015 medical classification task consists of four subtasks: compound figure detection, multi-label classification, figure separation and subfigure classification of which the BCSG participated in two subtasks <ref type="bibr" coords="2,435.30,143.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The remaining of this paper is organised as follows: In section 2 for the subtask compound figure detection, various image representations extracted are presented and the model classifier setup as well as submitted runs and their corresponding results are described. Modelling approach, submitted runs and results for the subfigure classification task are elaborated in section 3. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 4. Several figures found in biomedical literature consist of several subfigures. To obtain efficient image retrieval on a given search, it is necessary that these figures are separated and not considered as single figures. The first step in achieving this goal is to detect these compound figures. The detailed task definition is presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.03,355.81,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Compound</head><note type="other">Figure Detection</note></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Visual Features</head><p>For the visual image representation, a combination of high level and low level features was pursued. This is an important step in order to have 'whole-image' and 'detail' representation of an image. The Bag-of-Keypoints feature and the new Border Profile feature specifically adapted for this task were used for the visual image representation. The feature definitions and extraction procedures are described in the following subsections.</p><p>Border Profile: A highly distinguishing feature characterising a compound figure is the existence of a separating border. These borders are usually of white or black color. Hence the first visual feature computed is to detect the presence of such horizontal and vertical black and white color profiles for all images. For comprehension, a white or black border is present when all pixels of a row or column have RGB V alue = [255, 255, 255] or RGB V alue = [0, 0, 0] respectively. To detect this presence, the functions listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,372.54,572.32,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_3">1</ref> were implemented and their respective results were concatenated to obtain the complete feature vector. Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,155.27,596.23,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts a flowchart containing the steps computed for detection of white horizontal borders.</p><p>To visually demonstrate the outcomes of the functions in Table <ref type="table" coords="2,424.89,621.25,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_3">1</ref>, compound figures separated with white as well as black borders were selected. The compound figure in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="2,225.58,645.16,4.98,8.74">2</ref> displays the central nervous system and skeletal involvement by breast cancer of a rat and was adapted from <ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.78,657.11,14.61,8.74" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.  Compound figures can also be separated using borders with colors other than white. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,195.76,131.95,4.98,8.74">3</ref> display the detection of horizontal and vertical black separating borders. The compound figure adapted from <ref type="bibr" coords="4,335.12,143.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, shows a planning CT image and its corresponding follow-up CT image acquired at week 6 of combined radiochemotherapy of a patient. The same cut-off threshold outlined above was used.</p><p>Bag-of-Keypoints: For whole-image classification tasks, the bag of feature approach has achieved high accuracy results <ref type="bibr" coords="4,321.06,222.09,15.50,8.74" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="4,359.56,222.09,14.61,8.74" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The motivation to this idea comes from bag-of-word approach used for text categorisation. Limitations of invariance present in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,243.44,246.00,15.50,8.74" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was eliminated in the comprehensively evaluated approach presented in <ref type="bibr" coords="4,233.16,257.95,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which has now become a common state of the art approach for image classification. They proposed a method called Bag-of-Keypoints (BoK) which is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. Apart from the invariance to affine transformation, another advantage that comes with this method is the simplicity.</p><p>The task here to tackle being a whole-image classification task, the Bag-of-Keypoints approach was adopted as a visual image representation. The functions used for this approach are from the VLFEAT library <ref type="bibr" coords="4,366.57,341.73,14.61,8.74" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. As visual descriptors, dense SIFT descriptors applied at several resolutions were uniformly extracted with an interval grid of 4 pixels using the vl-phow function. To speed up computational time, k-means clustering with approximated nearest neighbours (ANN) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,134.77,389.56,15.50,8.74" target="#b14">[15]</ref> was computed on these randomly chosen descriptors using the vl-kmeans function, to partition the observations into k clusters so that the within-cluster sum of squares is minimised <ref type="bibr" coords="4,260.16,413.47,14.61,8.74" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>A maximum of 20 iterations was defined to allow the k-means algorithm converge. The cluster centres were initialised using random data points. As k = 12000, a codebook containing 12, 000 keypoints was generated and was further optimised by adapting a kd-tree with metric distance L 2 for quick nearest neighbour lookup using vl-kdtreebuild function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Textual Features</head><p>Text representations for all images was derived from their figure caption. All figures in the ImageCLEF collection originate from biomedical literature published in PubMed Central<ref type="foot" coords="4,218.98,546.44,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . The original figure caption and journal title are extracted from the provided XML files of this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bag-of-Words:</head><p>The Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach <ref type="bibr" coords="4,369.74,590.34,15.50,8.74" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is one of the common methods used for text classification. The basic concept here is to extract features by counting the frequency or presence of words in the text to be classified. These words have to be defined first in a dictionary or codebook. To generate the needed dictionary, all words from the captions of all images in the distributed collection were extracted. Several text processing procedures such as removal of stop-words and stemming using PorterStemmer <ref type="bibr" coords="5,359.88,131.95,15.50,8.74" target="#b22">[23]</ref> were induced to obtain a positive effect on computational time performance. The occurrence (%) for all words in both classes was computed. Words with less than 85% difference between the two classes were eliminated to further reduce the dictionary size. For the BoW representation two dictionaries were created:</p><p>-Dictionary 1 (D 1 ): 455 words obtained with porter stemming, removal of stop-words and word occurrence. -Dictionary 2 (D 2 ): 3906 words obtained with removal of stop-words and word occurrence. The benefit of χ 2 -test and Information Gain have been investigated, but not further used since no relevant advantage was detected during feature selection.</p><p>Charateristic Delimiters: When captions of compound figures are written, it is most likely that existing subfigures are addressed using some delimiter. Depending on the certainty that a figure can only be called 'compound figure' when it contains at least two subfigures, the presence of two delimiters was determined.</p><p>To achieve this task, a set of possible double delimiters characterising compound figures was computed. This step was manually done by analysing the captions of compound figures from the training set and selecting words with very high occurrence. Such words that appear often and hence significantly characterise the presence of subfigures are referred in this work as 'Characteristic Delimiters'. A sub-collection of delimiters used are listed in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,424.19,401.19,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_0">2</ref>.</p><p>If existence of a delimiter pair is detected in the caption of an image, the figure is textually represented by assigning the value <ref type="bibr" coords="5,371.87,425.10,10.51,8.74" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,384.03,425.10,7.75,8.74" target="#b0">1]</ref> and otherwise [0, 0] to the feature vector. ii.</p><p>First subfigure Second subfigure 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Classifier Setup</head><p>A fusion of all textual and visual representations will result to a feature vector with 15910 columns. To model an efficient and effective classifier, the feature dimensions and noise is reduced using the principal component analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="5,467.32,621.25,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The principal component analysis is separately computed on each feature vector group as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="5,233.39,645.16,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Subsequently, the best number of principal components needed to describe the feature were estimated by model selection.  The feature vector Border Profile and Characteristic Delimiter have both 2 columns and hence do not need any dimension reduction. Different combinations of the derived principal components are concatenated to obtain the final feature vector used for training the classifier. These combinations are the various runs submitted for evaluation. Table <ref type="table" coords="6,301.07,395.77,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">3</ref> lists the effects on prediction accuracy when certain features are left out during the feature fusion stage. In this ex-post analysis, the contribution (%) for each feature was computed by applying the classifier model of Run4 on the evaluation set and on 10 sampled learning and validation sets. It can be seen that all features contribute positively.</p><p>The distributed collection was split into 10 different learning and validation sets using the bootstrap algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="6,287.79,467.87,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For category prediction, a random forest (RF) classifier <ref type="bibr" coords="6,199.28,479.82,10.52,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref> using the fitensemble function from the MATLAB software package <ref type="bibr" coords="6,172.60,491.78,15.50,8.74" target="#b21">[22]</ref> was modelled. The list below is an excerpt of several parameters used to tune the classifier model. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Task Definition</head><p>Clinicians have implied on the importance of the modality of an image in several user-studies. The usage of modality information significantly increases the retrieval efficiency, thus image modality has become an essential and relevant factor regarding medical information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="7,339.54,645.16,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The subfigure classification subtask aims to evaluate approaches that automatically predict the modality of medical images from biomedical Journals. For further task definition, refer to <ref type="bibr" coords="8,134.77,131.95,14.61,8.74" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Some image categories were represented by few annotated examples, thus the expansion of the original collection was strived in order to counteract the imbalanced dataset. Additional datasets created are described below: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Visual Features</head><p>Over the years, various techniques for medical imaging have been developed. Each having not only its advantages and disadvantages, but also different acquiring technique. Hence various feature extracting methods are needed to apprehend the possible characteristics of medical images <ref type="bibr" coords="8,378.09,417.14,9.96,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In addition, images have to be completely represented, i.e. 'whole image' and 'detail' representation. This can be acquired by extracting global and local features. These features: BAF, Gabor, JCD, Tamura, PHOG were extracted using functions from the LIRE: Lucene Image Retrieval library <ref type="bibr" coords="8,303.25,464.96,14.61,8.74" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>-Bag-of-Keypoints: Visual image representation using the Bag-of-Keypoints approach described in the subsection 2.2. With the distinction, that three different datasets were used to create various codebooks accordingly. -BAF: The global features (brightness, clipping, contrast, hueCount, saturation, complexity, skew and energy) represented as a 8-dimensional vector. -CEDD: Low-level feature CEDD (Color and Edge Directivity Descriptor) <ref type="bibr" coords="8,470.09,544.75,10.52,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref> incorporating color and textures information were extracted and represented as a 144-dimensional vector. -FCH: The Fuzzy Color Histogram considers through fuzzy-set membershipp function the color similarity of each pixel's color to all histogram binis and is represented as a 10-dimensional vector using the fuzzy linking method <ref type="bibr" coords="8,151.70,616.49,14.61,8.74" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="8,169.97,616.49,14.61,8.74" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. -Gabor: A 60-dimensional vector was used to represent texture features based on Gabor functions.</p><p>-JCD: The Joint Composite Descriptor (JCD) is a combination of two Compact Composite Descriptors: Color and Edge Directivity Descriptor (CEDD) and Fuzzy Color Texture Histogram (FCTH) <ref type="bibr" coords="9,356.76,143.90,9.96,8.74" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The feature made up of merging the texture areas of CEDD and FCTH was represented as a 168dimensional vector. -Tamura: The Tamura features consisting of six basis textural feature: coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity and roughness, were represented as a 18-dimensional vector <ref type="bibr" coords="9,323.26,204.13,14.61,8.74" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. -PHOG: The Pyramid of Histograms of Oriented Gradients (PHOG) feature proposed in <ref type="bibr" coords="9,205.24,228.49,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> represents an image by its local shape and the spatial layout of the shape. A 630-dimensional vector was used for feature representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Textual Features</head><p>Similar to the compound figure detection task, textual representation for the figures was adopted using their corresponding captions.</p><p>Bag-of-Words: The process of textual representation executed is complementary to the process for the compound figure detection task described in subsection 2.3. With an adjustment in dictionary generation and word selection method. The figures distributed for the subfigure classification task are subfigures extracted from compound figures, hence their corresponding captions actually describe compound figure and not the single subfigures. Considering that multipane figures consist of subfigures not only from the same category but also from multiple categories, using the original captions to represent the subfigures will not lead to a valuable characterisation.</p><p>To overcome this limitation, the dictionary was built using the DataSet 4 . The figures in this dataset do not originate from multipane figures and thus have characteristic captions that can be mapped to the 30 subfigure categories. All words from all captions were retrieved, removal of stop-words and stemming was done in the text preprocessing stage. To develop a dictionary containing relevant words for each category, vector quantisation on all figures and the χ 2 -test <ref type="bibr" coords="9,470.08,506.70,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> was computed on the derived matrix. With this step, attribute importance for all words was effectuated.</p><p>A dictionary with 438 words was finally obtained by selecting words with attribute importance over a fixed cutoff threshold. The captions of the subfigures were trimmed to relevance using the characteristic delimiters presented in subsection 2.3 before vector quantisation on the generated dictionary was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Classifier Setup</head><p>Contrary to the compound figure detection task, not only a random forest classifier model was used. A multiclass linear kernel SVM from the libSVM library <ref type="bibr" coords="9,470.09,657.11,10.52,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was modelled to compare prediction accuracies between the two classifier models, as it has been a popular approach in former ImageCLEF medical challenges <ref type="bibr" coords="10,134.77,143.90,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The cost parameter used was C = 0.05. The random forest model was tuned with the same parameters mentioned in subsection 2.4. Ten samples of learning and validation sets were obtained using the bootstrap algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="10,417.91,167.81,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>To reduce computational time, feature dimension and noise reduction was achieved using the principal component analysis. All features beside the BAF features were reduced using this method. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,341.18,209.92,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref> presents the original and truncated vector size after computing the principal component analysis on each feature. The contribution of a feature to prediction performance is an important attribute that assists efficient feature selection. To obtain each feature contribution, the difference between the accuracy when all features are combined and the accuracy when a certain feature is omitted was calculated and displayed in the fourth column of Table <ref type="table" coords="10,240.54,281.65,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. The feature contribution analysis was done ex-post. The prediction accuracy used for this analysis was computed by applying the classifier model Run1 on the original evaluation set. Drawing conclusions using Table <ref type="table" coords="10,300.78,573.43,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, it can be seen that omitting most of the extracted features leads to a negative effect on prediction performance. The representations BoK, BoW and BAF have the most contributions. In contrary, the omission of PHOG feature has a positive effect on the prediction performance and hence increases the evaluation accuracy with +0.27%. The principal components computed from Gabor image representation did not improve the prediction accuracy and was omitted from the final fused feature vector used for classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Submitted Runs</head><p>The BCSG submitted eight (six Mixed, one Textual and one Visual) runs for evaluation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Results</head><p>The BCSG submitted runs in all submission categories: Visual, Textual and Mixed. Most of the submitted runs belong to the submission category 'Mixed' which is a combination of textual and visual representation. This decision was made because not only were better accuracies obtained during development, but also evaluation results presented by other ImageCLEF participant groups in the previous years tasks have proven to be better when the 'Mixed' submission category is induced <ref type="bibr" coords="11,243.38,621.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="11,261.64,621.25,14.61,8.74" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,315.08,621.25,4.98,8.74" target="#fig_5">5</ref> depicts the achieved performance of all submitted runs for the subfigure classification task. Runs belonging to the Biomedical Computer Science Group are represented in as colored bars and the gray bars represent submissions of other participants. The prediction confusion obtained applying the modelling setup Run5 on the official evaluation set is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" coords="12,326.63,398.63,3.87,8.74" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. Applying the same model setup on a sampled validation set results to the prediction confusion displayed in Fig.   Various classification prediction approaches based on multiple feature fusion and combination of classifier models were explored for the ImageCLEF 2015 medical classification task. Negative differences in the prediction performance were observed when the Bag-of-Keypoints representation was computed using SIFT <ref type="bibr" coords="13,160.81,192.90,15.50,8.74" target="#b19">[20]</ref> instead of dense SIFT descriptors, feature vectors weren't normalised and single precision format was used rather than double precision format to define floating-points numbers. The discrepancy between prediction performance on the evaluation set and on the sampled learning and validation sets is assumed to be an overfitting problem. Supplementing visual image representation with corresponding textual representation proved to be a beneficial strategy regarding classification accuracy. Omitting any of the described features apart from the PHOG feature, results to a negative decrease on the official evaluation accuracy. The proposed Border Profile image representation could be further enhanced by implementing additional functions to detect border profile of colors other than black and white.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,134.77,282.49,102.75,8.77"><head>2. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Task Definition</figDesc></figure>
