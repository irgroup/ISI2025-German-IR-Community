<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Best practice for clinical handover and its documentation recommends standardized, structured, and synchronous processes with patient involvement. Cascaded speech recognition (SR) and information extraction could support their compliance and release clinicians' time from writing documents to patient interaction and education. However, high requirements for processing correctness evoke methodological challenges. First, multiple people speak clinical jargon in the presence of background noise with limited possibilities for SR personalization. Second, errors multiply in cascading and hence, SR correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the requirements. This overview paper reports on how these issues were addressed in a shared task of the eHealth evaluation lab of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum in 2015. The task released 100 synthetic handover documents for training and another 100 documents for testing in both verbal and written formats. It attracted 48 team registrations, 21 email confirmations, and four method submissions by two teams. The submissions were compared against a leading commercial SR engine and simple majority baseline. Although this engine performed significantly better than any submission [i.e., 38.5 vs. 52.8  test error percentage of the best submission with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test value of 302.5 (p &lt; 10 -12 )], the releases of data, tools, and evaluations contribute to the body of knowledge on the task difficulty and method suitability.</p></div>

This shift-change nursing handover is a form of clinical narrative where only a small part of the flow is documented in writing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,292.00,237.18,10.88,8.96" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Best practice recommends standardized, structured, and synchronous processes for handover and its information documentation not only in the presence but also in active involvement of the patients, and where relevant, their next-of-kin <ref type="bibr" coords="2,234.15,273.18,10.66,8.96" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. 1 However, failures in information flow from nursing handover are a major contributing factor in over two-thirds of sentinel events in hospitals and associated with over a tenth of preventable adverse events <ref type="bibr" coords="2,404.95,297.21,10.66,8.96" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Only after a couple of shift changes, anything from two-thirds to all verbal handover information is lost or, even worse, transferred incorrectly if not documented electronically in writing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,140.06,333.21,10.87,8.96" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,153.35,333.21,7.24,8.96" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>In order to support compliance with these processes, cascaded speech recognition (SR) with information extraction (IE) has been studied in 2015 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,393.43,357.21,10.76,8.96" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,408.16,357.21,7.17,8.96" target="#b7">8]</ref>. As justified empirically in clinical settings in 2014, the cascade pre-fills a structured handover form for a clinician to proof and sign off <ref type="bibr" coords="2,291.77,381.21,10.89,8.96" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,305.43,381.21,11.96,8.96" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Based on the aforementioned rate of information loss, the approach of the nurse who is handing over proofing and signing off the document draft him/herself any time before the shift ends (but preferably immediately after the handover) can decrease the loss to 0-13 per cent.</p><p>This novel application evokes fruitful challenges for method research and development, and consequently, its first part (i.e., clinical SR) was chosen as the Task 1a of the eHealth Evaluation Lab by the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) in 2015 <ref type="bibr" coords="2,192.43,465.23,15.41,8.96" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. 2 First, clinical characteristics complicate SR. This derives from a large number of nursing staff moving between patient-sites to involve patients in handover, resulting in a noisy minimally-personalized multi-speaker setting far from a typical case with a single person, equipped with a personalized SR engine, speaking in a peaceful office. Second, SR errors multiply in cascading and, because of the severe implications that they may have in clinical decision-making, the cascade correctness needs to be carefully evaluated as meeting the clinical requirements.</p><p>The task aligns with the CLEFeHealth usage scenario of easing patients, their nextof-kin, and other laypersons in understanding and accessing electronic health (eHealth) information <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.85,573.23,15.93,8.96" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.87,573.23,11.96,8.96" target="#b13">13]</ref>. Namely, the application could release a substantial amount of nurses' time from documentation to, for example, longer discussions about the findings, care plans, and consumer-friendly resources for further information with 1 Also the World Health Organisation (WHO) provides similar guidance as a mechanism to contribute to safety and quality in healthcare at http://www.who.int/patientsafety/research/methods_measures/hu man_factors/organizational_tools/en/ (all websites of this paper were accessible on 25 May 2015) 2 https://sites.google.com/site/clefehealth2015/ the patients, and where relevant, their next-of-kin. Documenting every event in healthcare, as required by law, can take nearly sixty per cent of nurses' working time with centralized clinical information systems or fully structured information entry (whilst free-form text entry at the patient-site decreases this to a few minutes per patient) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.66,198.18,12.86,8.96" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.52,198.18,4.29,8.96" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,166.81,198.18,12.86,8.96" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. For example, every year within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on average seven physician consultations and 0.2 hospital discharges take place per capita. 3 SR writes a document draft from a tenth to three-quarters of the time it takes to transcribe this by hand, whilst the clinician's proofing time is about the same in both cases <ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.69,246.18,15.43,8.96" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The speech-recognized draft for a minute of verbal handover (with 160 words, corresponding to the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words <ref type="bibr" coords="3,276.05,270.18,16.09,8.96" target="#b18">[18]</ref>) is available only 20 seconds after finishing the handover with a real-time engine that recognizes at least as many words per minute as a very skilled typist (i.e., 120 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,283.39,294.21,15.01,8.96" target="#b19">[19]</ref>). Cascading this with content structuring through IE can bring further efficiency gains by easing finding information and making this content available for computerized decision-making and surveillance in healthcare <ref type="bibr" coords="3,168.26,330.21,15.43,8.96" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials and Methods</head><p>The hold-out method was used in performance evaluation of the task. Task materials consisted of a training set of 100 synthetic patient cases and an independent set of another 100 synthetic patient cases for testing. Given the training set, the task was to minimize the number of incorrectly recognized words on the test set (i.e., on the heldout set). Performance of the submitted methods and two baseline methods was compared statistically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dataset for Training</head><p>The dataset called NICTA Synthetic Nursing Handover Data was used in this task for method development and training <ref type="bibr" coords="3,268.13,509.27,10.69,8.96" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. 4 This set of 100 synthetic patient cases was developed for SR and IE related to nursing shift-change handover in 2012-2014. Each case consisted of a patient profile; a written, free-form text paragraph (i.e., the written handover document) to be used as a reference standard in SR; and its spoken (i.e., the verbal handover document) and speech-recognized (i.e., speech-recognized documents with respect to six vocabularies) counterparts. The dataset was released on the task page on 15 November 2014. First, the first author of this paper (Adj/Prof in machine learning and communication for health computing) generated 100 synthetic patient profiles, using common user profile generation techniques <ref type="bibr" coords="3,265.25,617.27,15.42,8.96" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. With an aim for balance in patient types, she created profiles for 25 cardiovascular, 25 neurological, 25 renal, and 25 respiratory 3 Derived from OECD.StatsExtracts (http://stats.oecd.org/) for 2009 (i.e., the most recent year that has almost all data available) 4 http://www.nicta.com.au/nicta-synthetic-nursing-handoveropen-data-software-and-demonstrations/ patients of an imaginary medical ward for adults in Australia. These patient types were chosen because they represent the most common chronic diseases and national priority areas <ref type="bibr" coords="4,181.94,174.18,15.43,8.96" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. The reason for patient admission was always an acute condition, but some patients had also chronic diseases. Some patients were recently admitted to the ward, some had been there for some days already, and some were almost ready to be discharged after a shorter or longer inpatient period. Each profile was saved as a DOCX file and contained a stock photo from a royalty-free gallery, name, age, admission story, in-patient time, and familiarity to the handover nurses.</p><p>Second, the first author supervised a registered nurse (RN) in creating the written handover documents for these 100 profiles. The RN had over twelve years' experience in clinical nursing. Australian English was her second language and she was originally from the Philippines. She was guided to imagine herself working in the medical ward and delivering verbal shift-change handovers to another nurse by the patient's bedside as if she was talking. All handover information was to be given as a 100-300-word monologue, using normal wordings. The resulting realistic but fully imaginary handovers were saved as TXT files.</p><p>Third, the first author supervised the RN in creating the verbal handover documents by reading the written handover documents out loud as the nurse giving the handover. She was guided to record in a quiet office environment, try to speak as naturally as possible, avoid sounding like reading text, and repeat the take until she was satisfied with the outcome. The Olympus WS-760M digital recorder [purchased for 269.00 AUD (191 €) in October 2011, weight of 51 g, dimensions of 98.5 mm × 40.0 mm × 11.0 mm] and Olympus ME52W noise-canceling lapel-microphone [purchased for 15.79 AUD <ref type="bibr" coords="4,219.94,426.11,24.99,9.06">(11 €)</ref> in October 2011, weight of 4 g (+ 11 g for an optional cable and clip), dimensions of 35 mm (+ a 15 mm plug) × 13 mm × 13 mm] were used, because they were previously shown to produce superior word correctness in SR <ref type="bibr" coords="4,124.70,462.21,10.69,8.96" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. 5, 6 Each document was saved as a WMA file and then converted from stereo to mono tracks and exported as WAV files on Audacity 2.0.3 for Mac. 7  Fourth, the first author used Dragon Medical 11.0 for SR. 8 This clinical engine was chosen because it included an option for Australian English. It was first initialized with not only this accent but also to the RN's age of 22-54 years and recording of The Final Odyssey [DOCX file of 3,893 words in writing and WMA file of 29 minutes 22 seconds as speech (4 minutes needed)] using the aforementioned recorder and microphone. Also these training/personalization/adaption files were released. Six Dragon vocabularies (i.e., general as the most generic clinical vocabulary, medical because of the medical ward, nursing because of the nursing handover, cardiology because of the cardiac patients, neurology because of the neurological patients, and pulmonary disease because of the respiratory patients) were compared although the nursing vocabu-5 http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/archived_products/audio/ audio_recording_1/ws_760m/index.pdf 6 https://shop.olympus.eu/UK-en/microphones/olympus/me52w-minimono-microphone-p-239.htm 7 http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/ 8 http://www.nuance.com/products/dragon-medical-practiceedition/index.htm lary shown to produce the best results in SR <ref type="bibr" coords="5,304.49,150.18,10.88,8.96" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,318.02,150.18,7.28,8.96" target="#b7">8]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">An Independent Dataset for Testing</head><p>The training set was supplemented with an independent dataset for testing. This additional set of 100 synthetic patient cases was developed in 2015. Each case consists of (1) a patient profile, (2) a written handover document, (3) a verbal handover document, and (4) a speech-recognized document with respect to the nursing vocabulary. Its subset of documents ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,228.07,332.25,3.90,8.96">3</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" coords="5,260.87,332.25,3.90,8.96">4</ref>) was released on the task page on 23 April 2015; the organizers did not release the profiles in order to avoid their contents to be used an a processing input, and they held the written handover documents out as a blind set for anyone but the first author and RN to ensure independent training and testing. The set was created the same way as the training set except that the profile photos were reused, software was updated to Audacity 2.1.3 for Mac with ffmpeg-mac-2.2.2, <ref type="foot" coords="5,446.23,390.06,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_2">11</ref> and only the nursing vocabulary was chosen for SR. The data release was approved at NICTA and the RN was consented in writing. The licensing constraints are the same as before; however, we ask to cite this task overview for the data release.</p></div>

Each participant was allowed to submit up to two methods/parameterizations/compilations (referred to as a method from now on) to the first category and up to two methods to the second category. If addressing both these categories, the participant was asked to submit all possible combinations of these methods as their third category submission (i.e., up to 2 × 2 = 4 files).</p><p>In addition to the submission category, the submissions consisted of the following elements: team name and description; address of correspondence; author(s); at least three method keywords; <ref type="foot" coords="6,220.97,171.99,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_4">13</ref> method description (max 100 words per method); and processing outputs for each method on the 100 training and 100 test documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Methods and Measures in Performance Evaluation</head><p>We challenged the participants to minimize the number of incorrectly recognized words on the independent test set. This correctness was evaluated on the entire test set using the primary measure of the percentage of incorrect words [aka the error rate percentage (E)] as defined by the Speech Recognition Scoring Toolkit (SCTK), 2.4.0 without punctuation as a differentiating feature. <ref type="foot" coords="6,318.05,282.06,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_5">14</ref> This measure sums up the percentages of substituted (S), deleted (D), and inserted (I) words (i.e., E = S + D + I) and consequently, the smaller the value of E, the better the performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Baselines Methods in Performance Evaluation</head><p>We used two baseline systems in the task, namely Dragon and Majority. The Dragon baseline was based on Dragon Medical 11.0 with the nursing vocabulary and initialization to the RN, recorder, and microphone. This commercial system included substantial but closed domain dictionaries, had a substantial license fee per person [purchased for 1,600.82 AUD (1,139 €) in January 2013], and was limited to the Microsoft Windows operating system. Notice that the 200 synthetic handover cases were not used to train the Dragon baseline. The Majority baseline assumed that the right number of words is detected (i.e., the number of test words originating from the refer-ence standard) and recognized each word as the most common training word (i.e., and) with correct capitalization (i.e., and for and, And for And, and so forth).</p><p>To supplement the usage guidelines of SCTK, <ref type="foot" coords="7,322.85,171.99,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_6">15</ref> we provided the participants some helpful tips (Appendix 1): we released an example script for removing punctuation and formatting text files; a formatted reference file and Dragon baseline for the training set; overall and document-specific evaluation results for this file pair; and commands to perform these evaluations and ensure the correct installation of SCTK.</p></div>

After ranking the baselines and submissions based on their error rate percentage on the entire dataset for testing, W was computed for the paired comparisons from the best and second-best method to the second-worst and worst method. The resulting p value and the significance level of 0.05 was used to determine if the median performance of the higher-ranked method was significantly better than this value for the lower-ranked method.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Community Interest and Participation</head><p>The task was open for everybody. We particularly welcomed academic and industrial researchers, scientists, engineers and graduate students in SR, natural language processing, and biomedical/health informatics. We also encouraged participation by multi-disciplinary teams that combine technological skills with nursing expertise. By 30 April 2015, 48 people had registered their interest in the task through the CLEF 2015 registration system, 18 and 21 of these team leaders had emailed to confirm their participation. From its opening on 27 October 2014 to this date, the task discussion forum gained five other members than the organizers. 19  By 1 May 2015, two teams submitted four methods. The first team, called TUC_MI/MC, was from the Technische Universität Chemnitz (TUC) in Germany. Its members were two researchers from the field of computer science, supervised by two TUC professors. They followed an interdisciplinary approach where one part brought the expertise from the field of speech processing to develop strategies for web-based language model adaptation. The other one came from the field of information retrieval to choose and develop methods for selecting and processing web resources to build a thematically coherent adaptation corpus. The second team, called UC, was from the University of Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. It consisted of two PhD 17 http://www.nicta.com.au/nicta-synthetic-nursing-handoveropen-data-software-and-demonstrations/. 18 http://clef2015-labs-registration.dei.unipd.it/ 19 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clefehealth2015-task-1a-speech-recognition students and three Professors from multi-disciplinary backgrounds, including clinical, public health, machine learning, and software engineering, working in collaboration. <ref type="foot" coords="11,463.27,159.99,6.48,5.83" target="#foot_8">20</ref>TUC_MI/MC submitted two SR methods. Their approach assumed each document having its own context and hence suggested adapting SR for each document separately. They used a two-pass decoding strategy: First, a verbal document was speech recognized. Then, keywords of the utterances were extracted and used as queries in order to retrieve web resources as adaptation data to build a document-specific dictionary and language model with the interpolation weights of 0.8 and 0.9 for TUC_MI/MC.1 and TUC_MI/MC.2, respectively. Finally, re-decoding of the same document was performed using the adapted dictionary and language model. Also UC submitted two SR methods. UC.1 was based on acoustic modeling of speech using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The verbal documents were preprocessed, including filtering, word level segmentation, and Mel Frequency Cepstral feature extraction, and HMM models were built for the training data. As there were no repetitions of data from different sessions, bagging and bootstrapping of training data were used. UC.2 combined language and acoustic models using the CMU Sphinx open source toolkit for SR. A custom dictionary and language model was developed for the speaker of the training set, because none of existing dictionary and language models was suitable for her accent. Unfortunately, the organizers had to reject this second method as even after an update request and deadline extension to 10 May 2015, this submission failed to meet the evaluation criteria for the format and completeness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Performance Benchmarks</head><p>The Dragon baseline clearly had the best performance (i.e., E = 38.5) on the independent set for testing, followed by the TUC_MI/MC.2 (E = 52.8), TUC_MI/MC.1 (E = 52.3), UC.1 (E = 93.1), and the Majority baseline (E = 95.4) (Table <ref type="table" coords="11,413.02,476.27,3.62,8.96" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The resubstitution performance of the first three methods was approximately the same (i.e., from E = 55.0 ± 0.9), but last two methods had nearly 100 per cent error also on the training set (Table <ref type="table" coords="11,200.48,512.27,3.62,8.96" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The performance of the Dragon baseline on the test set was significantly better than that of the second-best method (i.e., TUC_MI/MC.2, W = 302.5, p &lt; 10 -12 ). However, this rank-2 method was not significantly better than the third-best method (i.e., TUC_MI/MC.1), but this rank-3 method was significantly better than the fourthbest method (i.e., UC.1, W = 0, p &lt; 10 -15 ). Finally, the performance of the lowestranked method (i.e., the Majority baseline) was significantly worse than that of this rank-4 method (W = 1,791.5, p &lt; 0.05). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Running SCTK</head><p>The command bin/sclite -r reference.txt -h reference.txt trn -i spu_id -o all should produce perfect results by using the formatted reference standard both as a reference standard (-r reference.txt) and speech-recognized (or hypothesized -h) text. The command bin/sclite -r reference.txt -h dragon_nursing.txt -i spu_id -o all uses the formatted reference standard and formatted Dragon output, and hence should produce the aforementioned document-specific and overall evaluation results. The -i spu_id option refers to the transcription (TRN, i.e., a TXT file where each paragraph captures a handover document, followed by (documentID_V) with _V specifying the person whose voice/speech is recognized) formatted input files (with the default extended American Standard Code for Information Interchange encoding and the default GNU diff alignment) to pair the reference standard with the speech-recognized documents. The -o all option results in not only the evaluation results as percentages and raw numbers but also more details for analyzing correctly and incorrectly detected text patterns.</p></div>
