<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The BioASQ project <ref type="bibr" coords="1,229.45,501.67,10.52,8.74" target="#b0">[1]</ref> aims to provide a challenge framework for researchers dealing with classification (semantic indexing) and natural language processing (question answering) tasks in the field of bio-medicine. The challenge, similar to the previous two years, is divided in two tasks: automated semantic indexing (3a) and question answering (3b). In Task 3a participants are given a set of new, unannotated articles and are required to automatically predict the relevant MeSH terms for each one of them in a given time. For each article only the abstract along with some meta-information is provided (journal, year and title). This task is particularly difficult, as the MeSH taxonomy comprises of a large number of labels (âˆ¼ 27000), with the label set following a power-law similar distribution. Furthermore the terms are subject to a significant concept drift along time.</p><p>A number of different approaches have been pursued along the previous challenges, in order to automatically annotate new articles. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI/MTIFL) <ref type="bibr" coords="2,237.81,119.99,9.96,8.74" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, is a system that incorporates multiple rule-based and machine learning methods in order to effectively provide MeSH label recommendations for new articles. Other approaches include Learning-to-Rank methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,134.77,155.86,10.20,8.74" target="#b2">[3]</ref>[4], hierarchical classification <ref type="bibr" coords="2,273.58,155.86,10.52,8.74" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or multi-label ensemble approaches <ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.66,155.86,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In this work we build on the previous year's methods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,386.24,168.38,9.96,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, employing ensemble techniques for the semantic indexing task. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the methods used throughout the semantic indexing part of the challenge. Section 3 shows the relevant results. Final considerations and conclusions are drawn in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>In this section we present the methods that we used for the semantic indexing task. We first provide a brief description of those approaches that were used also in our previous challenge participation <ref type="bibr" coords="2,334.29,301.59,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and then provide the various extensions of our work with more detail.</p><p>In this year's participation, we used as a training set the last 1 million articles and reserved the last 20 thousand as a validation set. For pre-processing of the articles, a similar pipeline was used as in the previous years; the abstract and the title were concatenated, one-grams and bi-grams were used as features and stop-words as well as features with less than five occurrences in the corpus were removed. Following the above steps we obtained 257,197 one-grams and 478,533 bi-grams. The tf-idf representation was used for the features. Also, zoning of the features belonging to the title and those equal to a MeSH label was performed; specifically, we increased the tf-idf value of features that belonged to the title by log2 and those being equal to a label by log1.25.</p><p>The above features were used in order to train several multi-label learning models. We used the Meta-Labeler <ref type="bibr" coords="2,291.48,458.15,9.96,8.74" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a set of Binary Relevance (BR) models with Linear SVMs (both tuned and with default parameters) and a Labeled LDA variant, Prior LDA <ref type="bibr" coords="2,219.67,482.06,9.96,8.74" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Specifically for the SVM models, we used different values for the C parameter and handled class imbalance by penalizing more heavily false negative errors than false positive ones by adjusting properly the weight parameter <ref type="bibr" coords="2,182.42,517.92,9.96,8.74" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Rule-Based Journal Model</head><p>Along with the previously mentioned models, we developed a rule-based model, exploiting the journal-specific distributions of labels. The BioASQ corpus contains scientific papers from more than 5000 journals, that cover diverse scientific domains and topics and therefore we expect the MeSH terms distributions to greatly vary among them. Furthermore, articles belonging to a specific journal may contain one or more MeSH labels particular to that journal, e.g. we expect an article belonging to the journal "Pediatrics", to contain the MeSH terms "Infant" or "Infant, Newborn" with a rather high probability.</p><p>Given the above observations, we first studied the label distributions among different journals and we observed that specific labels appear with very high probabilities (â‰¥ 0.75) in every journal. Subsequently, we implemented a rulebased journal model in which labels are divided in two categories, frequent (for instance with more than 100,000 appearances out of the entire corpus of 4.2 million documents) and non-frequent. Then, each instance, according to the journal it belongs, is assigned automatically a frequent label if it has a probability of more than 0.95 in that journal and similarly a non-frequent label if the relevant probability is greater than 0.75. Naturally, multiple frequent and non-frequent labels can be assigned to the same instance. The above values were heuristically chosen, based on small-scale experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Ensembles</head><p>The systems used throughout the challenge, were mainly based on ensemble methods, similar to the previous year participation. We used the MULE framework <ref type="bibr" coords="3,159.69,313.25,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and further experimented on voting systems. In the following, we describe the details.</p><p>MULE MULE <ref type="bibr" coords="3,205.04,355.08,10.52,8.74" target="#b5">[6]</ref> is a statistical significance multi-label ensemble that performs classifier selection. The key idea is to combine a set of multi-label classifiers aiming to optimize a selected measure (for the purpose of this challenge, we are mainly interested in the micro-F measure) and validate this combination through a statistical significance test; McNemar's test. This way, each label of the multilabel problem is predicted with a specific component model, the one that (a) contributes to the greatest improvement to the evaluation metric of interest and (b) is validated from the statistical test to indeed produce the aforementioned improvement. If the null hypothesis of the statistical test is not rejected for a given label (i.e. if the improvement for a specific component model is not statistically significant), we predict that label with the globally optimal model.</p><p>Voting ensembles We further considered three voting ensembles, which decide whether to assign a label to an article or not based on the votes of the component models. The first voting ensemble relied on the majority vote, while the others on two and three votes respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Full-Text retrieval</head><p>In the PubMed interface <ref type="foot" coords="3,246.60,588.60,3.97,6.12" target="#foot_0">4</ref> , for a number of journals, open-access to the full text of the articles is available, through the PubMed Central (PMC) web page. The motivation is that the full text of an article will provide more semantic information and more features in order to learn MeSH terms, especially those occurring more rarely. After retrieval of a total of 160,691 entire articles (out of the entire corpus which consisted of 4.2 million abstracts) and having trained a Meta-Labeler model on the new data set, we used the model for prediction of new articles for which the full-text was also available.</p><p>In order to study the effect of including the full-text to learn a model, we considered the following strategies:</p><p>-FF: stands for use of the full text for both training and testing documents.</p><p>-FA: stands for using the full text only for documents in the training set ( for documents in the test set we use only the abstract). -AA: stands for using only the abstract for both training and testing -AF: for using full text only for the test set documents Table <ref type="table" coords="4,177.29,260.74,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the relevant results. We can easily see that including the full text of an article yields an improvement in Micro-F but not necessarily in the Macro-F measure. Also, the model does not seem to benefit from the respective combinations (AF, FA) In short, we would propose using the full-text on a similar semantic indexing task, only if the full text is available for both the training and the testing documents. Finally, we note that as the training data set for the full-text model was a lot smaller that the default abstracts data set ( 1m), the performance for these particular instances was significantly worse so this approach was not further considered during the BioASQ challenge. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Strategies against the Concept Drift</head><p>The BioASQ corpus extends over a period of almost 70 years  and thus we expect significant changes in the meaning and the context of concepts (i.e. MeSH terms). For instance, a disease in 1970 and in 2000 can be connected to totally different causes. Furthermore, the MeSH ontology is subject to changes and additions of new terms every year. The above factors affect the MeSHword distributions and consequently a machine learning model performance. In order to handle this phenomenon, we trained classifiers with variable training sizes and extending across various time periods <ref type="bibr" coords="4,352.49,633.20,128.10,8.74;4,134.77,645.16,23.80,8.74">(2012-2014, 2010-2014, 2007-2014)</ref> and combined them through the MULE framework (Sect. 2.2) along with the rest of the models. In this manner, we managed to use the useful semantic information across large portions of the corpus, at the same time smoothing out the effect of the concept drift in the model's performance. A more detailed study of the temporal aspects of the data along with their effect on performance can be found in <ref type="bibr" coords="5,187.90,155.86,14.60,8.74" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>In this section we present and discuss some key aspects with respect to the official challenge results (http://participants-area.bioasq.org/results/3a/, concerning our systems.

During the first and the third batch, we steadily obtained the second place for both Micro-F and LCA-F metrics (9 out of 10 weeks) while in the second batch we ranked in the third place. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,216.61,476.68,4.98,8.74" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results in terms of the Micro-F and the LCA-F measures, for the best performing model of each of the AUTH-Atypon, NLM and NCBI teams, during the first batch (the respective results for the two other batches are available at the BioASQ challenge website). Results are shown for the already annotated articles, as of May, 11. In total, we outperformed both NLM's (MTI/MTIFL) and NCBI's (MeSH Now BF/HR) systems in terms of Micro-F, while in terms of LCA-F, we outperformed the NCBI systems in 4 out of 5 weeks and NLM systems throughout the batch.</p><p>In order to indicate the improvement of our systems with respect to last year, in Table <ref type="table" coords="5,199.66,585.38,3.87,8.74" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, we additionally compare the mean results of this year's challenge (BioASQ 3) to the respective ones from last year (BioASQ 2). Results are shown for each year's data sets in terms of the mean performance in terms of Micro-F and LCA-F, for the top performing model across all weeks. We can observe a significant improvement between our two participations, mainly related to our use of a wider variety of component models, as well as to different parameterizations of the MULE ensembles. </p></div>
