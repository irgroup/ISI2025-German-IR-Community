<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Berkeley group 2 chose to perform some very straightforward experiments in retrieval of Russian documents using queries derived from topics in all three languages. Thus we performed two runs with monolingual Russian retrieval and one cross-lingual run each with German topics and English topics. Query translation was done using the online PROMT translator (www.translate.ru). Monolingual results were substantially better than the overall median performance of all Russian runs, and crosslanguage results were encouraging with German Russian retrieval doing substantially better than English Russian.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Domain-specific retrieval has been a track in CLEF since the beginning with the GIRT collections <ref type="bibr" coords="1,466.33,438.36,10.64,8.96" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. For the CLEF 2005 campaign, the domain-specific included a Russian social science abstract collection and the topics were available in German, English and Russian for experiments with all DS collections. Berkeley group 2 performed some very straightforward experiments in retrieval of Russian documents using queries derived from topics in all three languages. Thus we performed two runs with monolingual Russian retrieval and one crosslingual run each with German topics and English topics. Query translation was done using the online PROMT translator (www.translate.ru ) which prior experience had shown to produce more useful translations than the SYSTRAN translation system (http://babelfish.altavista.com).</p><p>The Russian collection of CLEF 2005 domain specific track consists of 94,581 documents containing titles (for all documents) abstracts (for 47,130 documents or 50% of the collection). Unfortunately for this collection, only 12% of the collection (11,403 documents) have controlled-vocabulary thesaurus terms assigned. The GIRT thesaurus terms are assigned from the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences <ref type="bibr" coords="1,370.81,587.88,11.66,8.96" target="#b5">[7]</ref> which has been made available in German, English and Russian.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Document Ranking, Collection and Query Processing and Translation</head><p>In all its CLEF submissions, the Berkeley 2 group used a document ranking algorithm based on logistic regression first used in the TREC-2 conference <ref type="bibr" coords="1,269.09,661.44,10.67,8.96" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For all runs, we used a 256 word Russian stopword list developed for the CLEF 2003 Izvestia collection to remove very common words <ref type="bibr" coords="1,402.54,672.96,11.68,8.96" target="#b4">[6]</ref> For stemming we utilized the Russian SNOWBALL Stemmer available from www.tartarus.org/snowball. As a general procedure, we also use Aitao Chen's blind feedback algorithm [2,3] every run. It selects the top 30 ranked terms from the top 20 ranked documents from the initial search to merge with the original query. Thus the sequence of processing for retrieval is: query stopword removal (decompounding) stemming ranking blind feedback The only translation done was query translation from English and German to Russian using the PROMT translator found online at www.translate.ru.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Runs and Results</head><p>Our results are summarized by topic in the following table with comparison to overall precision. The highlighted columns are the median performances for monolingual and cross-language IR while the final row is precision averaged over all 25 topics: The first monolingual Russian run (BK2MLRU1) and the two bilingual runs (BK2BLER1, BK2BLER2) were made using the required Title and Description (T-D) fields. The second monolingual run (BK2MLRU2) used the Title, Description and Narrative (T-D-N) fields. The T-D run (BK2MLRU1) achieved overall mean average precision of 0.304 with 9 best-of-topic results out of the 25 topics. Interestingly, the T-D run performed 30 percent higher than the T-D-N monolingual run (BK2MLRU2) which had an average precision of only 0.235, We speculate that this is because over half the documents in the collection only have a &lt;TITLE&gt; field and not a &lt;TEXT&gt; field, Topic 150 Поведение во время телепередач (Television Behaviour) retrieved zero relevant documents from all DS monolingual run, while bilingual runs to the Russian found only two relevant document with best average precision of 0.0178.</p><p>The German-Russian bilingual run BK2BLGR1 (MAP of 0.233) performed twenty nine percent better than the English-German run BK2BLER1 (MAP of 0.181). Much of this difference can be attributed to topic 143 Отказ от курения (Giving up Smoking) where the German translation seems to have been more accurate than the English one. The G--&gt;R precision for topic 143 was 1.0 while the E--&gt;R precision was 0.0094.</p><p>We believe we achieved our goal of providing a baseline performance for the Russian Domain Specific collection of CLEF. We believe our results provide a foundation from which more sophisticated experiments can be developed which leverage the controlled vocabulary indexing of the CLEF DS collections. For the future of CLEF domain specific Russian to be interesting and successful, substantially more documents will need to have indexing keywords assigned to the documents -12 percent is simply not enough to perform meaningful experiments on the utility of controlled vocabulary. In addition, document abstracts provide a richer set of textual clues from which to mine associations to controlled vocabulary terms as the work by Petras shows <ref type="bibr" coords="3,496.26,194.64,10.69,8.96" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</p></div>

Thanks also to Vivien Petras who performed the actual indexing and running of the experiments.</p></div>		</body>
