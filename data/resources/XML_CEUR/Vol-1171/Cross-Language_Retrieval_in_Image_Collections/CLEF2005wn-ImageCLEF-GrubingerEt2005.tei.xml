<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Selecting suitable topics in order to assess system effectiveness is a crucial part of any benchmark, particularly those for retrieval systems. This includes establishing a range of example search requests (or topics) in order to test various aspects of the retrieval systems under evaluation. In order to assist with selecting topics, we present a measure of topic complexity for crosslanguage image retrieval. This measure has enabled us to ground the topic generation process within a methodical and reliable framework for ImageCLEF 2005.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Benchmarks for image retrieval consist of four main elements: a collection of still natural images like <ref type="bibr" coords="1,203.79,471.48,11.70,9.02" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" coords="1,229.16,471.48,10.86,9.02" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; a representative set of search requests (called queries or topics); a recommended set of performance measures carried out on ground truths associated with topics <ref type="bibr" coords="1,218.04,494.88,10.65,9.02" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="1,235.60,494.88,10.86,9.02" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; and benchmarking events like <ref type="bibr" coords="1,379.27,494.88,11.70,9.02" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" coords="1,412.14,494.88,11.68,9.02" target="#b5">[6]</ref> that attract participants to make use of the benchmark.</p><p>The topic selection process is a very important part of any benchmarking event. In order to produce realistic results, the topics should not only be representative of the (image) collection, but also reflect realistic user interests/needs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,386.50,541.68,10.66,9.02" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This is achieved by generating the topics against certain dimensions, including the estimated number of relevant images for each topic, the variation of task parameters to test different translation problems, its scope (e.g. broad or narrow, general or specific), and the difficulty of the topic (topic complexity).</p><p>Hence, as the types of search request issued by users of visual information systems will vary in difficulty (or complexity), a dimension of complexity with respect to linguistic complexity for translation would help to set the context. Thus, there is a need for a measure of topic complexity that expresses the level of difficulty for retrieval systems to return relevant images in order to ground the topic generation process within a methodical and reliable framework.</p><p>As image retrieval algorithms improve, it is necessary to increase the average complexity level of topics each year in order to maintain the challenge for returning participants. However, if topics are too difficult for current techniques the results are not particularly meaningful. Furthermore, it may prove difficult for new participants to obtain good results and prevent them from presenting results and taking part in comparative evaluations (like ImageCLEF). Providing a good variation in topic complexity is therefore very important as it allows both the organizers (and participants) to observe retrieval effectiveness with respect to complexity level.</p><p>Quantification of task difficulty is not a new concept; on the contrary, it has been applied to many areas including information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,343.88,231.90,10.64,9.02" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, machine learning <ref type="bibr" coords="2,433.52,231.90,10.64,9.02" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, parsing and grammatical formalisms <ref type="bibr" coords="2,262.42,243.60,15.36,9.02" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and language learning in general <ref type="bibr" coords="2,425.82,243.60,15.37,9.02" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. More recent papers include the discussion of syntactic complexity in multimedia information retrieval <ref type="bibr" coords="2,178.96,267.00,16.73,9.02" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and a measure of semantic complexity for natural language systems <ref type="bibr" coords="2,124.74,278.70,15.39,9.02" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, none of this research deals with the definition of a topic complexity measure for cross-language image retrieval.</p><p>This paper describes such a measure for topic complexity. Section 2 gives a short overview, examples for each aspect of topic complexity are given in sections 3 (nouns), 4 (verbs) and 5 (adjuncts). Section 6 classifies and analyses the topics used at the ImageCLEF ad-hoc tasks from 2003 to 2005. Finally, section 7 outlines further improvement of the complexity measure and other future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview of a Measure for Topic Complexity</head><p>The first version of the proposed scale for topic complexity starts at 0 and is unlimited as far as query difficulty is concerned. Expressed as a positive integer, the higher the value c the higher is the topic complexity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="2,278.88,449.76,191.68,9.02">0 ≤ c &lt; ∞ (1)</formula><p>A value of zero implies that no translation is necessary and a simple keyword search would suffice for effective retrieval. An example for such a topic would be "David Beckham, 2005" as David Beckham is the same in every language <ref type="foot" coords="2,426.12,490.60,3.00,5.40" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , and so is the number 2005.</p><p>Each of the following topic elements adds one point to topic complexity value for (cross-language) retrieval of images with complex image contents using text-based search requests:</p><p>• nouns (used as subject, direct object, indirect object or in other cases, for example genitive) • qualifying attributes of nouns (adjectives) • noun cardinality (grammatical number) • verbs and qualifying attributes of verbs (adverbs) • time, place, manner and reason adjuncts In cross-language image retrieval, points are just added to the complexity level if a translation for that specific topic part is necessary (see examples hereinafter). No points are added for:</p><p>• meta-data like authors/photographers or the date of the picture • any other part of the sentence that does not require any translation Complexity points are accumulative: each of the elements can occur more than once and thus add more than one point (e.g. a topic can easily have two adjectives, like "traditional Scottish dancers"). However, logical OR constructs do not increase the complexity level if they could be expressed differently (for example: boys or girls is the same as children). The next three sections describe each of the topic elements in detail and provide example complexity scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Nouns</head><p>A word or phrase that refers to a person, place, thing, event, substance or quality is referred to as a noun (or noun substantive). Nouns can be classified in concrete nouns and abstract nouns. Concrete nouns refer to definite objects (e.g. racket, ball), whereas abstract nouns refer to ideas or concepts (e.g. fairness, freedom). In crosslanguage image retrieval, just concrete nouns should be used. Further, nouns can be proper nouns (e.g. "Michael"), common nouns (e.g. "boy"), or collective nouns (e.g. "team") and sees the use of all three types.</p><p>In topics, nouns can occur in several different cases: as subjects (performers of action), direct and indirect objects (recipients of action) and in the genitive case (indicates possession). Nouns in topics can further be described by the use of adjectives and have certain cardinality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Subjects (Nominative Case).</head><p>The subject of a verb is the argument which generally refers to the origin of the action. In languages where a passive voice exists, the subject of a passive verb may be the target or result of the action. Passive voice should not be used in topic sentences (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="3,162.13,540.36,14.72,9.02">4.1)</ref>.</p><p>Each noun used as a subject (e.g. in the nominative case) increments the topic complexity level by one point.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Direct Objects (Accusative Case):</head><p>Objects represent the target of the verb's action. In many languages, the accusative case of a noun is, generally, the case used to mark the direct object of a verb. The accusative case exists (or existed once) in all the Indo-European languages (including Latin, Sanskrit, Greek, German, Russian), in the Finno-Ugric languages, and in Semitic languages (such as Arabic). In modern English, which lacks declension in its nouns, objects are marked by their position in the sentence or using appositions (like "to" in "I gave a book to him").</p><p>Each noun used as a direct object (in the accusative case) increments the topic complexity by one point: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Indirect Objects (Dative Case):</head><p>The dative case is a grammatical case for nouns and generally marks the indirect object of a verb. Languages that use the dative case include Czech, Dutch, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovak, and Slovenian. In current English usage, the indirect object of an action is sometimes expressed with a prepositional phrase of "to" or "for", though an objective pronoun can also be placed directly after the main verb and used in a dative manner, provided that the verb has a direct object as well; for example, "the soccer referee shows a red card to David Beckham" can also be phrased as "the soccer referee shows David Beckham a red card".</p><p>Each noun used as an indirect object (in the dative case) increments the topic complexity by one point: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Nouns in Genitive Case (or other cases)</head><p>The genitive case is a grammatical case that indicates a relationship, primarily one of possession, between the noun in the genitive case and another noun. In English, this relation can be expressed by the use of the preposition of ("Lord of the Rings") or by the possessive -'s ending ("Schindler's List"). Several languages have real genitive cases, including Arabic, Latin, Irish, Greek, German, Dutch, Russian, and Finnish.</p><p>Each noun used in the genitive case (or in any other grammatical case that was not mentioned here) increments the topic complexity by one point: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Qualifying Attributes of Nouns (Adjectives)</head><p>An adjective is a part of a sentence which modifies a noun, making its meaning more specific. Adjectives can be used in a predicative (the sky is blue) or attributive manner (the blue sky). In some languages e.g. the Germanic languages (like German, English, etc), attributive adjectives precede the noun. In other languages, e.g. the Romance languages (like Spanish), the adjective follows the noun. Some languages do not even have any adjectives, for example Chinese (all the words that are translated into English as adjectives are actually stative verbs).</p><p>Each adjective used in a topic sentence increases the topic complexity by one point. Just attributive adjectives should be used. This example shows that a simple keyword search would not deliver good results anymore. Since keyword search does not associate attributes to the according nouns, it might as well return images showing: Portuguese soccer referee shows card to red Austrian soccer player or Austrian Soccer player shows card to red, Portuguese soccer referee etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Noun Cardinality (Grammatical Number, Numerals)</head><p>In linguistics, the grammatical number specifies the quantity of a noun or affects the form of a verb or other part of speech depending on the quantity of the noun to which it refers. Grammatical number is distinct from the use of numerals to specify the exact quantity of a noun.</p><p>Topics querying a specific number of a noun provide a special challenge and therefore is awarded one point for the topic complexity level.</p><p>Seven zebras drinking water. Siete cebras bebiendo agua. Sieben Zebras trinken Wasser.</p><p>Topic Complexity c = 4 (cardinality, subject, verb, direct object) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Verbs</head><p>A verb is a part of a sentence that usually denotes action ("kick"), occurrence ("to shine"), or a state of being ("stand"). Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. Verbs can further be described by the use of adverbs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Topic Verbs</head><p>Topics should just use verbs that clearly describe the situation in an image (like running, jumping, painting, hitting, and so on). Verbs or composite verb groups that need some level of interpretation (e.g. finding, forgetting, trying to hit, attempting to escape, etc.) are not used (see also <ref type="bibr" coords="6,256.64,618.78,15.05,9.02" target="#b13">[14]</ref>).</p><p>Verbs should be used in active voice only as passive voice does not exist in all languages. Further, since the captions describe an action that is happening in the image (at that moment), the grammatically correct form for English is the present continuous tense (the auxiliary verb to be is omitted). In Spanish, the appropriate tense is "el presente continuo" (present continuous tense), whereas in the German language, actions that are happening at the time are expressed with the "Präsens" (present tense). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Qualifying Attributes of Verbs (Adverbs)</head><p>An adverb is a part of a sentence that serves to modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, and clauses. Each adverb used in a topic sentence increases the topic complexity level by one point: Topics should just use adverbs that modify verbs. Adverbs that modify adjectives or other adverbs (adverbs of degree) are felt to be too subjective and should not be used for cross-language image retrieval of complex image contents. Adverbs of degree tell us about the intensity or degree of an action, an adjective or another adverb. Examples for adverbs of degree are: almost, nearly, quite, just, too, enough, hardly, scarcely, completely, very, extremely. For example: "Soccer player kicking ball very hard" or "extremely tall boy playing basketball".</p><p>One might argue that even the example given above may be very subjective and that adverbs should not increase the topic complexity level at all. However, as long as adverbs clearly influence the result set, they should be considered as a factor. In the example above, relevant images would include any tennis player driving, serving or smashing the ball or hitting the ball with topspin. Tennis players slicing the ball, playing a drop-volley or a stop-ball would not be relevant. This can clearly be seen by the technique of the tennis player. Hence, the adverb "hard" increases the topic complexity by one point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Valency</head><p>The number of arguments that a verb takes is called its valency. According to its valency, a verb can be classified as:</p><p>• Intransitive (valency = 1): the verb only has a subject. For example: "people marching". • Transitive (valency = 2): the verb has a subject and a direct object. For example:</p><p>"golfers swinging their clubs". • Ditransitive (valency = 3): the verb has a subject, a direct object and an indirect or secondary object. For example: "referee showing red card to soccer player".</p><p>It is possible to have verbs with valency = 0. A few of these appear in Spanish, Italian and other languages and are called impersonal verbs. For example: "Llueve" (Spanish) or "Piove" (Italian), which both mean "it rains".</p><p>Further, all languages are generally assumed to have a basic word order. Table <ref type="table" coords="8,465.55,313.44,5.01,9.02" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows all possible word orders for the subject, verb, and object (in the order of the most common to the rarest). For topics with valency 2 or higher, a simple keyword search is in some cases not sufficient any more as it can't detect grammatical relationships between search words. Searching for an image of "Boy chasing dog" or "Boy giving girl a candy" a simple keyword search would also return "Dog chasing boy" or "Girl giving boy a candy". In this case, due to the increased difficulty of actually having to distinguish between subject, direct and indirect object (which can't be done with the position of the noun since the word order can be different in many languages), the complexity level is increased by one point for verbs with a valency higher than 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Adjuncts</head><p>An adjunct is a type of adverbial illustrating the circumstances of the action. It expresses such relations as time, manner, place, and reason, i.e. it answers the questions: where (place adjuncts), when (time adjuncts), how (manner adjuncts) and why (adjuncts of reason). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Place Adjuncts</head><p>Place adjuncts indicate the location where the image was taken or where the action occurred respectively. Topics will use prepositional phrases as place adjuncts. As most of the countries, cities or other places have a different name in different languages, there will always be some sort of translation involved, thus the complexity level is incremented by one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Manner Adjuncts</head><p>Manner adjuncts further describe nouns or how actions are performed in an image. In comparison to general adverbs that modify verbs (see 3.2.2), now we just talk about prepositional phrases that describe how actions were performed.</p><p>Each manner adjunct increases the topic complexity by one point:</p><p>Woman in bikini leading horse with reins.</p><p>Mujer en bikini llevando un caballo con las riendas.</p><p>Frau in Bikini führt Pferd an den Zügeln.</p><p>Topic Complexity c = 6 (subject, manner adjunct, verb, direct object, manner adjunct)  Note that the English word why does not only refer to reason adjuncts (due to, because of) but also to purpose adjuncts (in order to). Reason adjuncts like "due to World War II" can be determined with some prior knowledge of the image, but purpose adjuncts refer to the future and can just be assumed.</p><p>Purpose adjuncts are felt to be too subjective as it involves too much interpretation of the picture and are therefore not considered for the topic complexity measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Topic Complexity at ImageCLEF</head><p>The ImageCLEF retrieval benchmark was established in 2003 with the aim of evaluating image retrieval from multilingual document collections <ref type="bibr" coords="10,388.56,671.46,22.18,9.02">[5][6]</ref>. This section presents the results of the new topic complexity measure applied to the 2003, 2004 and 2005 ad-hoc ImageCLEF tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Topic Complexity at ImageCLEF 2005</head><p>In the ImageCLEF 2005 ad-hoc task <ref type="bibr" coords="11,284.07,218.16,15.38,9.02" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the participants were provided with 28 topics translated into 33 different languages. Table <ref type="table" coords="11,336.00,229.86,5.01,9.02" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the analysis of the topic complexity for each of the topic titles in English. Likewise, the complexity levels have been calculated for all alphabetical languages (Romanic alphabet) with more than 10 submitted runs (e.g. European and Latin-American Spanish, Italian, German, French, Dutch, Portuguese) as same concepts are sometimes expressed with different topic complexities across various languages.</p><p>A total of 11 research groups submitted 349 runs and produced the following Mean Average Precision scores for each topic (Table <ref type="table" coords="11,340.52,654.90,3.76,9.02">3</ref>, next page).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" coords="13,169.54,150.00,10.03,9.02" target="#fig_13">14</ref> shows that a strong negative correlation exists between the level of topic complexity and MAP of submitted ImageCLEF results (the higher the topic complexity score, the lower the MAP score). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Topic Complexity at ImageCLEF 2004</head><p>In ImageCLEF 2004 <ref type="bibr" coords="13,213.81,449.99,10.66,9.02" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, twelve participating groups submitted 190 runs to the adhoc task. Similar to results in section 6.1, the levels of topic complexity were calculated for all topics and compared with the average MAP results for languages with more than 10 submissions. Figures 15 shows, again, a strong negative correlation. The correlation factor ρ x,y is always stronger than -0.4, reaches more than -0.6 for Italian and German and even more than -0.7 for French.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Topic Complexity at ImageCLEF 2003</head><p>In ImageCLEF 2003 <ref type="bibr" coords="14,213.84,224.88,10.66,9.02" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, four participating groups submitted 45 runs to the ad-hoc task. Similar to results in sections 6.1 and 6.2, the levels of topic complexity were calculated for all topics and compared with the average MAP results for languages with more than 5 submissions. The results shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,261.65,477.23,10.04,9.02" target="#fig_15">16</ref> show a very strong negative correlation again. Like in 2004 and 2005, the correlation factor ρ x,y is always stronger than -0.4 (except for Italian which is due to a couple of translation problems that produced surprising results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this paper, we present a measure for the degree of topic complexity for search requests of cross-language image retrieval. Establishing such a measure is beneficial when creating benchmarks such as ImageCLEF in that it is possible to categorise results according to a level of complexity for individual topics. This can help explain results obtained when using the benchmark and provide some kind of control and reasoning over topic generation.</p><p>Examples illustrating various aspects of the linguistic structure of the complexity measure and motivating its creation have been presented. Comparing the level of complexity for topics created in ImageCLEF 2003 to 2005 for the ad-hoc task with MAP scores from submitted runs by participating groups have shown a strong nega-tive correlation indicating that more linguistically complex topics result in much lower MAP scores due to the requirement of more complex translation approaches.</p><p>Future work will involve the improvement and refinement of the complexity measure and further verification by analysing results from the 2006 ImageCLEF adhoc task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,252.00,581.94,71.57,9.02;3,252.00,593.64,96.76,9.02;3,252.00,605.34,92.67,9.02;3,252.00,628.92,99.36,9.02;3,252.00,640.68,114.05,9.02"><head>Turtle</head><label></label><figDesc>eating leaf.
