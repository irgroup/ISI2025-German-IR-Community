<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Our participation in WebCLEF 2005 is focused in the monolingual (spanish) mixed task. This task has two goals: to nd named web pages and home web pages. Every query has an only right answer: both kinds of queries are mixed, and we don't know in advance wich kind is every query.</p><p>In principle, the basic approach consists of nding the pages whose content is more similar to each query; it is hoped that the valid answer is in the rst retrieves pages, and depends on the techniques applied in this search that the ranking is worse or better.</p><p>For the queries searching a home page we will apply some procedure that rearranges the retrieved documents list, considering, in addition to its similarity with the query, several evidences of which can be home pages. An additional problem is that we do not know a priori what queries or topics look for home pages and which not, so we will have to include some procedure that analyzes the queries and determines which persecute a home page and which not.</p><p>This paper is organized as follow2: section 2 describes the part of the collecion of documents which we have worked with. Section 3 decribes our aproach to task; next, we show the runs submitted anthe their results; last, conclusions are given. Of another side, documents seems to be stripped in a size next to 64 K; in binaries les, as is the case of some PDFs, chars chr(0) seems to be replaced by a space (chr(32)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Topics</head><p>There are 118 topics in spanish, 59 searching for home pages and 59 for named pages. The concept of home page, however, is some fuzzy; the consideration of some of the searched pages as home is quite debatable.</p><p>In addition, there are some mistakes in the topics set. Thus, some topics are duplicated, or even triplicated. Some of them, with diferent correct page as answer in the qrels le. Some topics are a formulation too wide. By example, topic WC0098: Consejer a de Educaci on y Cultura; there are, in Spain, 17 Autonomous Communities and every one of them has a Council of Education and Culture. Besides, we have found that many embassies have also a Consejer a de Educaci on y Cultura, and there is a lot of embassies. Which of all these is the right answer?</p><p>A few topics have as correct answer a page which is not in the .es domain. This is, maybe, right; but, since we work only in the .es domain, we can't nd the correct page anyway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our approach</head><p>As we said before, the basic idea is to nd the most similar pages to every query, and, for the home pages queries, rearrange the list of retrieved documents boosting those more likely home pages.This carry us, in addition, to analyze the queries to determine the type of these.</p><p>First part, to nd the most similar pages to every query, can be solved by a classic information retrieval aproach. Nevertheless, web pages have informative elements other than the simple text which we can see at the browser's window. Thus, we can use these elements to improving the retrieval</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Combining elements</head><p>The possible list of elements we can take in account in the web pages is extensive, but we focused in: the eld body, which seems the most important the eld title the contents of some META tags, as is the case of Description and Keywords the text of the backlinks, that is the links wich, in the other documents are pointing to the page tha we are analyzing.</p><p>All this elements are evidences tha we can combine to nd the most similar pages to every query. There are several ways to do the fusion, or combining these elements; a rst issue is to do the fusion prior or after run the query.</p><p>Our choice is to do it after; so, the procedure tha we applied is as follows:</p><p>to build an index with every of the elements tha we take in account to run the query in every one of these indexes to combine the results achieved with every of indexes For the rst step, we have used our software Karpanta <ref type="bibr" coords="3,332.16,255.32,9.96,11.62" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, based on the well known vector space model, and we built indexes of: body, title, meta description, meta keywords and text of backlinks.</p><p>Terms weights are computed in a classic way based int tf ¢ IDF known as atc. In all cases stop words (from a standard list of about 300 spanish words) were removed, and a enhanced s-stemmer was applied <ref type="bibr" coords="3,144.02,303.14,9.96,11.62" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The size of the indexes is dierent, as are the elds on wich the indexes are based on. Almost all HTML pages have a eld body (some of them only have java scripts and so on), but is not the same with the other indexes. So, 71.5 % of the pages in the .es domain have a eld title, and the average size of the titles is about 40 characters; this is likely the titles are, in general, very shorts.</p><p>On the META Description tag, is present in only 16.9 % of the documents, with an average size of 38.6 characters. From these documents with META Description tag, in 7.4 % of them the content of the META Description tag is identical to the eld title.</p><p>About the keywords (META Keywords tag), they are present in 24.7 % of the documents, with 7.7 keywords per document, in average (a keyword is not a term, but every expresion delimited with a semicolon inside the tag; so, there are keywords wich are multiword expresions).</p><p>24.7 % of the documents don't receive any link (from the documents in the collection); documents with backlinks receive an average of 9 per document. Text of these backlinks is very short (18.7 characters in average), but, perhaps, very signicative.</p><p>So, it seems clear that, except the body eld, the other elements seems to have a limited importance, as they are absents in lots of documents.</p><p>For the fusion of the list produced by every retrieval of every index, a z-score normalization of the similarity values <ref type="bibr" coords="3,196.50,518.33,10.52,11.62" target="#b1">[2]</ref> was performed and then the lists were merged with the CombMNZ algorithm <ref type="bibr" coords="3,135.41,530.29,9.96,11.62" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, adapted to weight in dierents ways the results obtained with every index:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="3,195.79,537.16,211.41,44.21">Score = n X i=1 score i ¢ k i ¢ number of score ! = 0</formula><p>There are several procedures of combining <ref type="bibr" coords="3,294.26,589.98,9.96,11.62" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,311.22,589.98,14.61,11.62" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,329.49,589.98,14.61,11.62" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,351.43,589.98,9.96,11.62" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Most of them are based on combining the similarity values obtaines after run the query on every of indexes; nevertheless, we can also work with the rank positions in the lists of retrieved documents in every index <ref type="bibr" coords="3,468.40,613.89,14.61,11.62" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This algorithm has the advantage of the simplicity, as not even is necessary to normalize the similarity values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">To nd home pages</head><p>First we must determine wich queries are about home pages. The concept of home page, nevertheless, is fuzzy; so, some of the correct answers to some queries, everybody would not consider home pages.</p><p>In a exploratory phase, we examined manually several home pages from the .es; specially, we examined de title eld, as we think that a query searching for these page, probably was enough similar to the title of this one. Besides, we examined the home page queries used in TREC. They are in English, but, after translated to Spanish, they can aproximate the structure and characteristics of this kind of query.</p><p>In this exploratory phase we observed some common elements in the structure of the home page queries. This structure lies about using certain terms in relationship with the searched home page. Thus, this kind of pages are entry pages to the webs of certains institutions: ministries, institutes, centers, etc. So, these terms will be present in the query <ref type="bibr" coords="4,386.27,169.88,9.96,11.62" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Besides, they will be in certains positions inside the query, and they will go accompanied, before and later, of certain auxiliary words (articles and other connectors). This allowed us to build a set of home page query patterns, to which we added a simple heuristic: the presence of expresions as home page, portal, etc.</p><p>With this technique we were able to correctly identify 32 home page queries, 4 were erroneously considered as home, and 27 could not be classied.</p><p>Once identied, trough this way, the assumed home page queries, the results of a retrieval made with the fusion of evidences as we have seen before, were re-ranked in a way that the relevant pages most probably home page were in the rst places.</p><p>There are several techniques to determine which retrieved pages can be home pages. These are not excluding techniques and they can be combined. The most known techniques are based on using two types of information: the URL page structure, and the link analysis.</p><p>Techniques based on URL structure work with the URL deep. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,396.05,325.30,15.50,11.62" target="#b9">[10]</ref> studied the statistical distribution of home pages in several URL deep levels, and also <ref type="bibr" coords="4,367.20,337.26,9.96,11.62" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,384.83,337.26,15.50,11.62" target="#b12">[13]</ref> also use techniques based on the URL length, as <ref type="bibr" coords="4,190.78,349.21,15.50,11.62" target="#b14">[15]</ref> do.</p><p>Techniques based on link analysis also are widely used. Although considered of smaller utility in the searches by content, they seem eective to retrieve home pages <ref type="bibr" coords="4,409.54,373.12,9.96,11.62" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Several coecients are used, from the simples in and out-degrees <ref type="bibr" coords="4,296.15,385.08,14.61,11.62" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to most sostied page-rank <ref type="bibr" coords="4,441.31,385.08,15.50,11.62">[19]</ref> or HITS <ref type="bibr" coords="4,502.48,385.08,10.52,11.62" target="#b3">[4]</ref> algorithms.</p><p>We have tried with Page-Rank <ref type="bibr" coords="4,242.60,408.99,9.96,11.62" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and with Centrality <ref type="bibr" coords="4,348.62,408.99,9.96,11.62" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, both based on backlinks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Runs submitted</head><p>Our goal is to determine which elements or evidences are useful in a search based on contents; also, to test the eectiveness of coecients based on link analysis to nd home pages. Ocial results are given in table <ref type="table" coords="4,251.73,487.66,3.87,11.62" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Run USAL0 acts as baseline, and it consist in queries in Spanish against the pages of the .es of EuroGov Collection. In this run, we work with the eld body only.</p><p>Run USAL1 combines results of elds body, title, META Description and text of backlinks of every page.</p><p>Run USAL2 adds to the USAL1 the eld META Keywords. Runs USAL3 and USAL4 try to apply specic techniques to nd home pages. On the retrieved documents of the run USAL1, a try to detect the home page topics is done, and then, results are been re-ranked with Page-Rank (USAL3) and centrality (USAL4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation</head><p>Table <ref type="table" coords="4,117.47,629.58,4.98,11.62" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the results of the ocial evaluation of the submitted runs. However, we have seen before somo problems about the queries (duplicateds ones, right answers in anothers domains). So we have carried out an unocial evaluation, removing erroneous topics: duplicated ones (even triplicated), right answers out of the .es domain, badly formulated queries. Classication in home and named pages, although debatable, we have left it as it were.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>It seems clear that working with more elements, in addition to the body eld, improves retrieval. This is true in the case of title, META Description and the text of the backlinks. However, including META Keywords makes worse the results. This can be surprising (some simplistics retrieval systems are based only on this eld), but, if we examine the uses tha pages do of this eld, we will see that, at least, it is a strange use. Table <ref type="table" coords="5,320.92,392.14,4.98,11.62" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the most used keyword expressions (not individual terms) in the .es domain.</p><p>Most of them are very generic expressions, little useful for searches that take place on a governmental collection. Some are included in pages also translated to English, some are directly included in English, without version in Spanish (although the language of the rest of the page is the Spanish).</p><p>A manual examination of some page of the collection shows that there are pages (specially home pages of certain institutions) having, literally, hundreds of keywords. In some cases, these lists of keywords are inherited with no variation by the rest of the pages of that site. Probably this has something to see with some myths that circulate on the form in which the search engines nd and rank the pages. Some pages repeat a lot of times same keyword, in the hope of search engines place it in the rst positions of the list.</p><p>As for the location of home pages, it seems that the use of patterns to distinguish home page queries and to treat them specically works on, since runs USAL3 and USAL4 improves on the previous ones. Of these two, Centrality produces better results to detect home pages. Centrality is simpler and it does not discriminate backlinks, but it seems that the home pages not necessarily are the most prestigious.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We have described our participation in WebCLEF 2005, based on the retrieval by contents by means of the fusion or combination of dierent elements, as well as on the use of coecients coming from the link analysis for the location of home pages.</p><p>The use of elements of information as the TITLE or the text of backlinks improves clearly the retrieval, although many pages even lack TITLE or backlinks; and although the texts of many backlinks are very short. Nevertheless, keywords introduced by the authors of the pages is from little aid and they do not produce good results.</p><p>Coecients based on the analysis of links, like Page-Rank or the simple Centrality Coecient, helps to locate home pages. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="2,90.00,112.85,423.01,187.25"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Blacklist for .es domain<ref type="bibr" coords="2,90.00,203.50,8.07,16.14" target="#b1">2</ref> The collection of documents Our participation this year is limited to domain .es in the EuroGov collection.
